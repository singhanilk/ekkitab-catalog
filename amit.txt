9780007302345	Wetlands	Charlotte Roche		An international sensation with more than 1 million copies sold in Germany, and rights snapped up in 26 countries Wetlands is the sexually and anatomically explicit novel that is changing the conversation about female identity and sexuality around the world. Helen Memel is an outspoken, contradictory eighteen-year-old, whose childlike stubbornness is offset by a precocious sexual confidence. She begins her story from a hospital bed, where she`s slowly recovering from an operation and lamenting her parents` divorce. To distract and console herself, Helen ruminates on her past sexual and physical adventures in increasingly uncomfortable detail; what ensues is a headlong dash through every crevice and byproduct, physical and psychological, of its narrator`s body and mind. (The New York Times) Fantastically sexual, Helen is constantly blurring the line between celebration, provocation, and dysfunction in her relationship with her body. Punky alienated teenager, young woman reclaiming her body from the tyranny of repressive hygiene (women mustn`t smell, excrete, desire), bratty smartass, vulnerable, lonely daughter, shock merchant and pleasure-seeker Helen is all of these things and more, and her frequent attempts to assert her maturity ultimately prove just how fragile, confused, and young she truly is. In the tradition of The Sexual Life of Catherine M and Melissa P.`s 100 Strokes of the Brush Before Bed, Charlotte Roche exposes the double bind of female sexuality, delivering a compulsively readable and fearlessly intimate manifesto on sex, hygiene, and the repercussions of family trauma.	2009-01-05	Fourth Estate Uk						ZZZ000000

9788172234591	Awakening The Mind, Lightening The Heart	Dalai Lama		"We can achieve enlightenment only through the practice of meditation; without it there is noway we can transform our minds." - His Holiness the Dalai Lama With extraordinary grace and insight, the dalai Lama shows how Tibetan Buddhist teaching on compassion can be practiced in our daily lives, through simple meditations that relate directly to past and present relationships. While many world religions have mind-transforming or purifying techniques, Buddhists have placed particular emphasis on these pratices for more than 2,000 years. Basing his discussion on a fifteenth- century Buddhist text, the spiritual leader of the Tibetan people gives clear, highly accessible explanations of these methods and how they can be incorporated into the busy rhythms of modern life. The Dalai Lama won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989 and is the author of two memoirs and several books on Buddhism. Awakening the Mind, Lightening the Heart is the second volume in the Library of Tibet series, which was founded in order to preserve and disseminate the cultural heritage of Tibet. The volumes of the Library will cover Tibetan history and culture, from meditations practices to social history. Volume Editor Donald S. Lopez is Professor of Buddhist and Tibetan Studies at the University of Michigan. John F. Avedon, General Series Editor of the Library, is the author of In Exile from the land of Snows, the definitive history of modern Tibet.	2005-10-17	HarperCollins						OCC000000

9780007270064	Lewis Hamilton,My Story	Lewis Hamilton		Lewis Hamiltona??s explosive arrival on the Formula 1 scene has made front-page headlines. In My Story, for the first time Lewis opens up about his stunning debut season, including the gripping climax to the 2007 F1 World Championship, as well as his dad Anthony, his home life and his early years. The only book with the real story, as told by Lewis. In his first season in F1, Lewis Hamilton has thrilled the world of motor racing by finishing on the podium in his first nine consecutive races a?? the first driver to do so in the sport's 57-year history. With victories so far in Canada, America and Hungary, he currently leads the World Drivers' Championship, the youngest driver ever to do so. But bare statistics alone do scant justice to the amazing impact Lewis Hamilton has had on the sporting landscape this year. My Story gives the real account from Lewis himself, as he sets the record straight about his colourful life on and off the track. Given a grounded upbringing by his dedicated father in unremarkable Stevenage, Lewis tells about how he first tried out go-karting while on a cut-price family holiday in Ibiza. In his book he gives the real version of events at a motor sport dinner where, as a nine-year-old wearing a borrowed suit, he approached McLaren team boss Ron Dennis with the immortal words that were to change his life forever. He rose rapidly through the Junior and Formula ranks, dominating every series with his raw speed and canny race craft. Here Lewis candidly recalls those key moments that shaped his career and went some way towards compensating for the sacrifices made by his father Anthony in getting his son to the top. Lewis also charts how he got into the sport and was signed up by Ron Dennis, what motivates him, who are his closest friends, how he copes with the constant travelling, and the physical and mental challenges of driving a state-of-the-art Formula 1 car. He looks back in detail at the 2007 World Championship a?? his three race wins so far, the frightening crash in Germany, his intense rivalry with team-mate Fernando Alonso, his special relationship with Ron Dennis, and what ita??s like living under the spotlight of the paparazzi a?? right up to the last race of the season in Brazil.	2008-04-15	HarperSport						ZZZ000000

9780007263516	The Giver	Lois Lowry		It's a perfect world, where everything looks right. But ugly truths lie beneath the surfacea?| It is the future. There is no war, no hunger, no pain. No one in The Community wants for anything. Everyone is provided for. Each Family Unit is entitled to one female and male child. Each member of The Community has their profession carefully chosen for them by the Committee of Elders, and they never make a mistake. Jonas, a sensitive twelve-year-old boy, had never thought there was anything wrong with his Community, until one day. From the moment Jonas is selected as the Receiver of Memory at The Ceremony, his life is never the same. Jonas discovers that The Community is not as perfect as it seems. Although they appear to have everything, they are missing something of great importance. It is up to Jonas, with the help of the Giver, to find what long ago had been lost. And so Jonas embarks on an adventure to save the world as he knows it. Simply and beautifully written, The Giver is sure to touch the heart of every reader. Lois Lowry deals with issues of everyday life that are so often taken for granted. Through the noble character of Jonas, she presents a glimpse of what could be the future. As the tension in the novel mounts, so does the number of questions that Lowry confronts the reader with. The Giver is a book of courage and adventure, and most importantly, one of deep thought. Once readers make contact with Lowry's treasure, they may never see things exactly quite the same. Lowry presents a forceful novel that demands to be heard and philosophically dealt with.	2008-05-05	HarperCollins Children's Books						FIC028000

In the time it takes him to reach a hospital, his heart irretrievably damaged, he travels down memory lane, reliving his life lived in the border town of Ferozepur, Punjab-from pre-Partition India, to the holocaust that accompanied independence, the Indo-Pak wars, the Green Revolution and the rise of religious extremism. Increasingly isolated in the terror-infested eighties, an era of curfews, encounters and hit lists, his world all but falls apart as his wife falls under the spell of a rabid preacher; his best friend, a Hindu, flees the town; the Bar Council where he works cleaves along religious lines; and he himself makes an error of judgement that could have serious security ramifications. As he nears the end of his walk, and his life, he wonders: will there ever be a redemption, a homecoming? Redolent of the soil and the spirit of Punjab, The Long Walk Home is as much one man`s odyssey through tumultuous times as it is an elegiac meditation on the passing of a way of life, on faith and fundamentalism and misguided passions.	2009	Harper Collins						ZZZ000000

Yet, there are points in history at which we can draw close parallels between our past and present. Our history shapes the way we live today, even as we might strive to break away from the bounds of the past." "With a narrative scope beginning with human origins around 5 million years ago, and ending with global communications and the economy and environment in the modern age, The Times History of the World is a superb accomplishment. The body of the text is a chronological sweep across the history of the world, split geographically and thematically." "In addition, historian Richard Overy gives us his opinions in an exclusive extended article which enables him to freely explore the lessons the world has learnt from history, as well as the ways in which the world is constantly changing. He shows how the world has in a sense, become smaller, as communications and technology become more and more prevalent, but how wars and conflicts, poverty and religion, can still drive us apart. Concluding with thoughts on what will be the dominant factors driving the world in the future, Richard Overy gives us a rare opportunity to consider world history in one magnificent sweep."--BOOK JACKET.	2008-10-06	Times Books						ZZZ000000

9788188569083	Jesus	David Edmunds		Jesus of Nazareth's life on earth left a larger mark on Western history than that of any other man or woman. He lived 2000 years ago, he wrote nothing himself; in fact, everything we know "officially" about him is contained in about 100 often redundant and occasionally contradictory pages. He seems to have been on the record for only about three years of his life, from the age of about 30 until he was killed at the age of around 33. But what he taught in that brief span of time has pervaded Western thought for 2000 years-years that are measured throughout much of the world from the time of his birth, a date that chronologically divides Western history into two parts, Before and After. In this book the remarkable story of Jesus Christ has been narrated in his own voice, bringing alive the times and teachings of this great messiah.	2010-01-01	Indus Source Books						ZZZ000000

Often they linger at a certain level, even after the most sophisticated quality management techniques have been deployed. This is usually because the root causes have not been accurately diagnosed. This book chronicles a series of eight dramatized, real-life cases, through the medium of a professor-protegee relationship, leading to a formal technique called Differential Diagnosis. This technique is unique, because it is based on "backward thinking", while most other techniques use "forward thinking". The real-life cases demonstrate how to overcome the difficulties of application, allowing the practitioner to transcend from knowledge to profound knowledge.	2010	Indus Source						ZZZ000000

But does such fond nostalgia really stand up? Vivid, rich in anecdote, sometimes angry and always persuasive, "The Sixties Unplugged" is a hugely entertaining and authoritative account of the decade of myth and madness. Read it and remember that even if you weren't there, you can still find out what really happened.  'A fabulous history of the decade that lacks the usual nostalgia. Gerard DeGroot explores the period with all its horrors from the Chinese Cultural Revolution to the failure of the super powers in the Six-Day War. He does catalogue the free love and flower power festivals but in sharp contrast to the ethnic cleansing in Jakarta and the real threat of nuclear war. This is a really important book to put perspective on such a formative decade and remove some of the romance.' "The Bookseller"	2009-04-03	Pan						ZZZ000000

9780330419550	Madam Secretary,A Memoir	Madeleine Korbel Albright		Madeleine Albright was for eight years during the first and second Clinton terms privy to some of the most fascinating and controversial episodes in recent memory.

Weaving together the public and the private, the national and the intimate, "Madam Secretary" is a valuable contribution to political history and destined to become a classic of its kind.

In his discussions with groups in such diverse countries as Colombia, Algeria, Kosovo, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Iran, Lebanon, France, Cambodia and Ireland, Rees seeks to pierce the propaganda, to discover the human story behind the faceless, hooded caricature, and to test our preconceptions of just what the word terrorist actually means.

9780330483063	Seizure	Robin Cook		What could the Shroud of Turin, a conservative Southern senator, and an entrepreneurial researcher have in common? Here politics, religion and bioscience collide in the latest novel from the master of the medical thriller.  Senator Ashley Butler is a quintessential demagogue whose support of traditional American values includes a knee-jerk reaction against virtually all biotechnologies. When he's called on to chair a sub-committee introducing legislation to ban new cloning technology, the senator views it as a keystone to his political future. As a consequence, Dr Daniel Lowell - inventor of a technique that will take stem-cell research up to the next level - sees a barrier being raised before his biotech start-up.  These seemingly opposite personalities may clash during the Senate hearings, yet the two men share a common failing. Butler's hunger for political power far outstrips his genuine concern for the unborn; while Lowell's pursuit of massive personal wealth and celebrity overrides any real considerations for his patients' well-being.  Further complicating their confrontation is the confidential news that Senator Butler has developed Parkinson's disease - which leads the senator and the researcher into a Faustian pact. But in attempting to utilise Lowell's new technology prematurely, the therapy leaves the senator with the horrifying effects of temporal lobe epilepsy - causing seizures of the bizarrest order.  Taken straight out of tomorrow's headlines, Seizure is a cautionary tale for this age when new biotechnological discoveries are pulling us ever further into a promising yet frightening new world.	2004-04-02	Pan						ZZZ000000

Abbas's original screenplay and dialogue, based on a story by K.A. Abbas and V.P. Sathe. A seriously neglected area of Indian cinema is the subject of film dialogue. Though cinema is mainly a visual experience, it is through dialogue that we know the thoughts and emotions of the film's characters. Through K.A. Abbas's words and the poetic songs by Shailendra and Hasrat Jaipuri, Awaara's Judge Raghunath (Prithviraj Kapoor), Raj (Raj Kapoor) and Rita (Nargis) come alive. The film has a wonderful mix of one-liners, quips, punchlines and catchphrases while being modern, witty and full of nuance. Awaara's dialogue and songs have been carefully transcribed from the film's original soundtrack by Suhail Akhtar and Vijay Jani and presented in Hindi, Urdu and Roman scripts. The English translation of the dialogue, an introduction and commentary are by Nasreen Munni Kabir. With a foreword by Randhir Kapoor, this unique book also features many stills from a most loved and enduring classic by Raj Kapoor, one of Indian cinema's master filmmakers.	2010	Niyogi Books						ZZZ000000

Lee Fiora is an intelligent, observant fourteen-year-old when her father drops her off at the prestigious Ault School in Massachusetts; she leaves behind her affectionate family in South Bend, Indiana, her head filled with images from the school's glossy brochure, in which boys in sweaters chat in front of old brick buildings, girls hold lacrosse sticks on pristine athletics fields, and everyone sings hymns in chapel.  As Lee soon learns, Ault is quite unlike anything she has previously experienced, a self-enclosed world populated by jaded teenagers whose expectations, values and social rituals are utterly unfamiliar to her.

'Smart, witty and sensitive . . . Any girl who's ever felt like an outsider will be drawn to troubled Lee, a scholarship teen at a posh boarding school' "InStyle"  'An addictive portrait of adolescence - "The OC" meets Donna Tartt's "The Secret History" with flashes of "Clueless"' " Observer"  'Sittenfeld writes with confidence, her dialogue rings true . . . and her observations range from witty to surprisingly funny, sometimes absurd' "Herald"	2006	Picador						ZZZ000000

9780330507875	The Sweet Shop Owner	Graham Swift		The first novel from the Booker Prize-winning author of "Last Orders" and "Waterland" In the sweet shop Willy Chapman was free, absolved from all responsibility, and he ran his sweet shop like his life - quietly, steadfastly, devotedly. It was a bargain struck between Chapman and his beautiful, emotionally injured wife - a bargain based on unexpressed, inexpressible love and on a courageous acceptance of life's deprivations . . . threatened only by Dorry, their clever, angry, unforgiving daughter. 'In his moving first novel, "The Sweet Shop Owner," Graham Swift illuminates the history of one man through flashbacks on the last day of that man's life. Through the succinctly evoked provincial decades one of the engrossing features is the difficulty of love and of communication between generations' "London Review of Books" 'This beautifully balanced novel describes the arrangements, accommodations, pacts and treaties of our ordinary lives' "The Times" 'A quiet but beautifully shaped book' "Literary Review" 'Book for book, Swift is surely one of England's finest novelists' John Banville 'A remarkable novel . . . There is a touch of Joyce in Graham Swift's revelation of the hidden poetry of small men's lives' "New York Times Book Review"	2010-04-02	Picador USA						ZZZ000000

It makes the gigantic, imaginative leap so essential to understanding total deafness' Jack Ashley, "Sunday Telegraph"  'Compelling . . . A journey well worth taking . . . One cannot read more than a few pages of Sacks without seeing something in a new way' " Los Angeles Times"  'Written by a hearing - and caring - neurologist who through empathy and contact has penetrated a long way into deaf culture. What he has written about should be compulsory reading - I do not recall another book which puts the issues so clearly for the rest of us' Alex Comfort, " Guardian"  'A manifesto characteristically humane and impassioned . . .

9780330473231	Letters Between a Father and Son	V S Naipaul		In 1950, V. S. Naipaul travelled from Trinidad to England to take up a place at Oxford University. Over the next few years letters passed back and forth between V. S. Naipaul and his family - particularly his beloved father Seepersad, but also his mother and siblings. The result is a fascinating chronicle of Naipaul's time at university; the love of writing that he shared with his father and their mutual nurturing of literary ambition; the triumphs and depressions of Oxford life; and the travails of his family back at home.  This engrossing collection has been updated with new material. Spanning the early years of V. S. Naipaul's burgeoning literary career, these letters touch time and again on the craft of writing, and reveal the relationships and experiences that formed and influenced one of the greatest and most enigmatic literary figures of our age.  'Extraordinary and moving . . . this book is both heartening and terribly sad' Alain de Botton, "Sunday Telegraph"  'Rare and precious . . . if any modern writer was going to breathe a last gasp into the epistolary tradition, it was always likely to be V. S. Naipaul' Robert Winder, "New Statesman"  'A fascinating psychological narrative' Jason Cowley, "The Times"	2009-04-03	Picador						ZZZ000000
9780330433280	Magic Seeds	Vidiadhar Surajprasad Naipaul		Willie Chandran is a man who has allowed one identity after another to be thrust upon him. In his early forties, after a peripatetic life, he succumbs to the encouragement of his sister - and his own listlessness - and joins an underground movement in India. But years of revolutionary campaigns and then prison convince him that the revolution 'had nothing to do with what we were fighting for', and he feels himself further than ever 'from his own history.'  When he returns to Britain where, thirty years before, his wanderings began, Willie encounters a country that has turned its back on its past and, like him, has become detached from its own history. He endures the indignities of a culture dissipated by reform and compromise until, in a moment of grotesque revelation - a tour de force of parodic savagery from our most visionary of writers - Willie comes to an understanding that might finally allow him to release his true self.  Praise for "Magic Seeds":  'Original, ruthlessly honest, intellectually stimulating and masterfully written' "The Times"  'A radical further step in one of the great imaginative careers of our time . . . "Magic Seeds" demands our attention, and nothing more authoritative will be published this year' Philip Hensher, " Daily Telegraph "  'Spare, concentrated and always capable of breaking out into extraordinary flashes of sympathy, awareness, and insight' D.

Her voice is that of a nightingale. They fall in love without an eye-contact talk, share everything, foresee future... destiny had something in their fate... This novel takes you to a journey of love, romance, passion, thrill and saturnine events. "Thy fate is the common fate of all, Into each life some rain must fall." ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- ABOUT THE AUTHOR: Pankaj Pandey, a technocrat turned writer, is an ex-student of Babu Banarsi Das Institute of Technology, Ghaziabad. He is an eloquent speaker and is striving to be successful in the field of leadership, life improvement and consultancy. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- MEDIA REVIEWS: The Saga of Love is a vibrant and cherished love story. --Organiser A unique love story via the telephonic conversation which is beautifully written by the author. --Dainik Jagran ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- EXERPTS: She emerged through the lane from her classroom with open hair, a tinge of lip-liner, walking next to hundreds of students, some standing right in her path. Without getting perturbed, she walked across the lawn, went to the library, returned her books and walked back on the same path before disappearing out of sight.  It was amazing...  I had never seen a girl behave in such a different manner.  That night, while I was studying, she unknowingly entered my mind, preventing me from completing my task.  Those were unforgettable moments and I was impressed by her.  Next day, when I went to college, my eyes searched for her in the crowd. I didn't even tell my friends about this as they would have ridiculed me. I never let anyone know that I had noticed a girl, who had left an indelible impression on my mind.  I would often analyse the way she walked and also her style of keeping the tippet round her neck. Her lips shone as if they were reflections of champagne. Sharp features on her face held me transfixed. I loved to hear the sound of her anklets when she passed by. She was admirable. A uniform was prescribed in our college and she dressed in such a way that none would fail to notice her. She had a very pleasant nature.  She often came to the first floor to collect some stationery items and I would intently gaze at her as my classroom was on the first floor.  I was a boy with good looks, lean of build and of fair complexion. If marks in class were the hallmark of a good student, then I was one, but she was better than me.  She lived in a private hostel while I lived in Engineers Palace (the name of our rented flat). The Engineers Palace had five permanent residents: Pankaj (me), Anurag, Ritesh, Amit and Sujeet. If the first alphabet of each name was to be arranged one after another, it read as PARAS. We had such a lively and friendly nature that many of our other friends wished to live a life like us. Anurag was a friend of Shikha. Within ten days of my love at first sight, I had started mailing her on Orkut. For the first six days I did not receive any reply. But I was not the one to be easily disheartened. I continued to mail her at regular intervals till she was forced to enquire about me. I just wanted to be noticed by her.  But she was too practical a girl. My other friend, Shreya, was close to her and lived in the same hostel. She told Shikha as to what kind of person I was and all that she knew about my behaviour and nature. In the meantime, she accepted my desire for friendship via the Orkut site. Even a slightest success in love makes a person feel as if he has conquered a planet.  I was a desperate sort of guy; despite possessing a lot of self-confidence, I was impatient to talk to her. I used to check my scraps regularly to see if she had sent any reply or not. During college days I was a fairly talented as I used to participate in all kinds of competitions and had won some fairly good prizes. Our semester results were declared and I fared well in the examination but, as usual, she secured a better percentage. She was jubilant and I was exhilarated. Then came February 14, Valentines Day--the day I was desperately waiting for. The Air Force written examination results had been declared and I qualified in it. I thought it would be the best time to talk to her, so I dialled her number and began, "Hi Shikha, this is Pankaj."  "Hi," she replied in a vibrant tone.  "You know, I have qualified in the Air Force written examination," I announced proudly.  "Oh, that's great! Congratulations. When are you offering me a treat?" she asked.  "Very soon," I replied. Her voice was comparable to that of a nightingale--it was so sweet! On hearing her voice, I felt I had lost my senses and was flying high up in the sky.  Next day, when I saw her in college, she was surrounded by her friends. I waved my hand and she responded alike, but in a subdued manner so that nobody would catch her gesture.  I was happy that she had responded to my overtures. Now, my dream was to continue with the relationship, whatever it was. So, I gathered feedback by talking to some of her close friends. I found that she was impressed by me. I was, however, reluctant to call her again. Without fail, I would daily think about her but could not muster the courage to talk to her. After eight days, I dialled her number. We talked as if we had known each other for long. I don't know what she liked in me--my optimistic nature, I presume! We talked about our friends, their characteristics, shared same jokes, guided each other on how to proceed in life and shape our career and everything else possible under the sun. The duration of our talk used to be long. This helped me believe that she too liked me.  I started talking to her daily. Numerous questions arose in my mind on how to proceed--whether she would understand me or not, what to talk about and so on. Finally I left everything to destiny to decide our fate. It was a Monday when I rang her in the evening. She sounded a bit nervous and tense as though she was troubled in mind. She was surrounded by many of her friends awaiting for their lovers', as she used to say.  I knew everything about her (her past, her present), but she was unaware about the sense of excitement that used to engulf me every time I talked to her. I used to be so happy that it cannot be expressed on paper. Shikha was really quixotic!  As days passed, we became more familiar and started understanding each other better. She began to trust me and shared a few of her past secrets in life. She told me about a guy who was her friend since the past few years. The man had a fierce attitude and a lethal nature that kept him involved in all kinds of activities that did not impress the kind of girl Shikha was.  Being curious by nature, I began to realise how innocent and sober she was. Her voice was so sweet. I was so much preoccupied in listening to her that I did not catch the gravity of the situation in which she was. After an hour or so, when I realised the seriousness, I gave her a suggestion, "Why don't you lodge a police complaint if he is pestering you? That will prevent him from calling you again and again. He will not dare to disturb you then." She was not satisfied by my suggestion and said, "I will not entertain him and will change my number." However, it has been my firm conviction that all good actions are bound to bear fruit. When our conversation got over, I realised that I too had some rigid streak in me about which she would be able to learn in few days. After meeting Shikha, I had decided to amend my ways. I would rather say that I gradually started spreading my tentacles in love.	2008-06-01	General Press						ZZZ000000
9788183520652	Tales from India (GOLDEN CLASSICS SERIES)	Rudyard Kipling		This selection serves up the very best of Kipling's short Stories. Politics, the Raj, and the life of the common soldier are some of the familiar themes associated with Kipling, but these stories also reflect the more unexpected aspects of Kipling's character and the different influences of the contrasting countries--India, America and England--in which he lived. His progressive portrayal of women, his interest in supernatural and religious experiences, his understanding of the processes of mental and spiritual breakdown, and the curative powers of art, are all revealed in this fascinating perspective of a great writer. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Rudyard Kipling was an English author and poet, born in India, and best known today for his children's books, including The Jungle Book (1894), The Second Jungle Book (1895), Just So Stories (1902), and Puck of Pook's Hill (1906); his novel, Kim (1901); his poems, including Mandalay (1890), Gunga Din (1890), and If- (1910); and his many short stories, including The Man Who Would Be King (1888) and the collections Life's Handicap (1891), The Day's Work (1898), and Plain Tales from the Hills (1888). He is regarded as a major innovator in the art of the short story. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The Story of Muhammad Din Who is the happy man? He that sees in his own house at home, little children crowned with dust, leaping and falling and crying. ---Munichandra, translated by Professor Peterson. The polo-ball was an old one, scarred, chipped, and dinted. It stood on the mantelpiece among the pipe-stems which Imam Din, khitmatgar, was cleaning for me.  "Does the Heaven-born want this ball?" said Imam Din deferentially. The Heaven-born set no particular store by it; but of what use was a polo-ball to a khitmatgar ?  "By Your Honour's favour, I have a little son. He has seen this ball, and desires it to play with. I do not want it for myself."  No one would for an instant accuse portly old Imam Din of wanting to play with polo-balls. He carried out the battered thing into the verandah; and there followed a hurricane of joyful squeaks, a patter of small feet, and the thud-thud-thud of the ball rolling along the ground. Evidently the little son had been waiting outside the door to secure his treasure. But how had he managed to see that polo-ball ?  Next day, coming back from office half an hour earlier than usual, I was aware of a small figure in the dining-room--tiny, plump figure in a ridiculously inadequate shirt which came, perhaps, halfway down the tubby stomach. It wandered round the room, thumb in mouth, crooning to itself as it took stock of the pictures. Undoubtedly this was the "little son."  He had no business in my room, of course; but was so deeply absorbed in his discoveries that he never noticed me in the doorway. I stepped into the room and startled him nearly into a fit. He sat down on the ground with a gasp. His eyes opened, and his mouth followed suit. I knew what was coming, and fled, followed by a long, dry howl which reached the servants' quarters far more quickly than any command of mine had ever done. In ten seconds Imam Din was in the dining-room. Then despairing sobs arose, and I returned to find Imam Din admonishing the small sinner who was using most of his shirt as a handkerchief.  "This boy," said Imam Din judicially, "is a budmash"a big budmash. He will, without doubt, go to the jail-khana for his behaviour." Renewed yells from the penitent, and an elaborate apology to myself from Imam Din.  "Tell the baby," said I, "that the Sahib is not angry, and take him away." Imam Din conveyed my forgiveness to the offender, who had now gathered all his shirt round his neck, stringwise, and the yell subsided into a sob. The two set off for the door. "His name," said Imam Din, as though the name were part of the crime, "is Muhammad Din, and he is a budmash." Freed from present danger, Muhammad Din turned round in his father's arms, and said gravely, "It is true that my name is Muhammad Din, Tahib, but I am not a budmash. I am a man!"  From that day dated my acquaintance with Muhammad Din. Never again did he come into my dining-room, but on the neutral ground of the garden we greeted each other with much state, though our conversation was confined to "Talaam, Tahib" from his side, and "Salaam, Muhammad Din" from mine. Daily on my return from office, the little white shirt and the fat little body used to rise from the shade of the creeper-covered trellis where they had been hid; and daily I checked my horse here, that my salutation might not be slurred over or given unseemly.  Muhammad Din never had any companions. He used to trot about the compound, in and out of the castor-oil bushes, on mysterious errands of his own. One day I stumbled upon some of his handiwork far down the grounds. He had half buried the polo-ball in dust, and stuck six shrivelled old marigold flowers in a circle round it. Outside that circle again was a rude square, traced out in bits of red brick alternating with fragments of broken china; the whole bounded by a little bank of dust. The water-man from the well-curb put in a plea for the small architect, saying that it was only the play of a baby and did not much disfigure my garden.  Heaven knows that I had no intention of touching the child's work then or later; but, that evening, a stroll through the garden brought me unawares full on it; so that I trampled, before I knew, marigold-heads, dust-bank, and fragments of broken soap-dish into confusion past all hope of mending. Next morning, I came upon Muhammad Din crying softly to himself over the ruin I had wrought. Some one had cruelly told him that the Sahib was very angry with him for spoiling the garden, and had scattered his rubbish, using bad language the while. Muhammad Din laboured for an hour at effacing every trace of the dustbank and pottery fragments, and it was with a tearful and apologetic face that he said, "Talaam Tahib," when I came home from office. A hasty inquiry resulted in Imam Din informing Muhammad Din that, by my singular favour, he was permitted to disport himself as he pleased. Whereat the child took heart and fell to tracing the ground-plan of an edifice which was to eclipse the marigold-poloball creation.  For some months the chubby little eccentricity revolved in his humble orbit among the castor-oil bushes and in the dust; always fashioning magnificent palaces from stale flowers thrown away by the bearer, smooth water-worn pebbles, bits of broken glass, and feathers pulled, I fancy, from my fowls--always alone, and always crooning to himself. A gaily-spotted sea-shell was dropped one day close to the last of his little buildings; and I looked that Muhammad Din should build something more than ordinarily splendid on the strength of it. Nor was I disappointed. He meditated for the better part of an hour, and his crooning rose to a jubilant song. Then he began tracing in the dust. It would certainly be a wondrous palace, this one, for it was two yards long and a yard broad in ground-plan. But the palace was never completed. Next day there was no Muhammad Din at the head of the carriage-drive, and no "Talaam, Tahib" to welcome my return. I had grown accustomed to the greeting, and its omission troubled me. Next day Imam Din told me that the child was suffering slightly from fever and needed quinine. He got the medicine, and an English Doctor. "They have no stamina, these brats," said the Doctor, as he left Imam Din's quarters.  A week later, though I would have given much to have avoided it, I met on the road to the Mussulman burying-ground Imam Din, accompanied by one other friend, carrying in his arms, wrapped in a white cloth, all that was left of little Muhammad Din.	2009-01-01	General Press						ZZZ000000

The text is an artful mix of compassion and humor, and readers are encouraged to confront what they would most like to avoid, which in turns provides the key to true insight and power.Joy is a wondrous investigation into the source and importance of joyfulness in our lives.	2004-02-17	St. Martin's Press						ZZZ000000

9789380032641	Flash In The Pan:A Guide To What To Cook And H	Patel Tushita		Traditionally, cookbooks in India are written either by chefs with instructions down to milligrams or by aunties, grande dames of cuisine for whom a dinner party is nothing less than a seven-course affair with plate changes, fish forks and napkins. In between lies a generation of Indians who don t really care for perfection, but aspire towards fun in the kitchen by cooking for friends and family. Flash in the Pan is for those urban Indians who have been exposed to international dining experiences, but who are confident enough to flaunt their home food, and eventually their own home cooking. It s a modern recipe book which guides the reader towards easy, but not boring, ghar-ka-khana type cooking. It s about flashy recipes that are surprisingly simple. The main influences in this book have come from the author s travels which have mainly been determined by food, and by friends who are often great home cooks.	2009	Westland Books Pvt.

9788183281386	Indian Birds in Focus,Birds of the Indian Subcontinent and Their Habitats	Amano Samarpan		Indian birds as you may never have seen them before! In these pages, you can see the details of creatures that otherwise, one might be able to afford only a glimpse of. This book of photographic portraits presents both common and seldom seen birds of the Indian subcontinent in their habitats not just as a way to more clearly identify and hence understand them but also because it recognises the important role that environment plays in their survival. The future of birds not only rests on the preservation of their habitats, the avian population is itself an important indication of the health of the environment. Birds typically have evolved through their ability to exploit a certain ecological niche. Although the environment a particular bird prefers over another is seldom a defining characteristic, such classification can help in identifying birds in the field and provide valuable data towards understanding their behaviour.	2009-03-01	Wisdom Tree						ZZZ000000

9781847374387	Life with My Sister Madonna	Christopher Ciccone&Wendy Leigh		Christopher Ciccone's extraordinary memoir is based on his forty-seven years of growing up with, working with and understanding the most famous woman of our time who has intrigued, scandalized and entertained millions for half a century. Through most of the iconic star's kaleidoscopic career, Christopher played an important role in her life: as her back-up dancer, her personal assistant, her dresser, her decorator, her art director, her tour director. If you think you knew everything there is to know about Madonna, your are wrong. Only Christopher can tell the full-scale, riveting untold story behind Madonna's carefully constructed mythology, and the real woman behind the glittering façade. From their shared Michigan childhood, which Madonna transcended, then whisked Christopher to Manhattan with her in the early eighties, where he slept on her roach-infested floor and danced with her in clubs all over town - Christopher was with her every step of the way, experiencing her first-hand in all her incarnations. the spoiled daddy's girl, the punk drummer, the raunchy Boy Toy, Material Girl, Mrs. Sean Penn, Warren Beatty's glamorous Hollywood paramour, loving mother, Mrs. Guy Ritchie, English grande dame - Christopher witnessed and understood all of them, as his own life was inexorably entwined with that of his chameleon sister. He tangled with a cast of characters from artist Jean-Michel Basquiat, to Gwyneth Paltrow, Kate Moss, Demi Moore and, of course, Guy Ritchie, whose advent in Madonna's life splintered the loving relationship Christopher once had with her. The mirror image of his legendary sister, with his acid Ciccone tongue, Christopher pulls no punches as he tells his astonishing story. Life with My Sister Madonna is the juicy, can't-put-it-down story you've always wanted to hear, as told by Madonna's younger brother.	2008-07-14	Simon & Schuster						ZZZ000000

9781847377777	I, Sniper	Stephen Hunter		When four famous 1960s' radicals are gunned down, including the wife of an international media mogul, it would appear to be an open-and-shut case. A wealth of evidence ties the chief suspect, retired Marine sniper Carl Hitchcock, to the murders. Holder, until recently, of the record number of kills in Vietnam and anxious to reclaim his title, Hitchcock's subsequent suicide would seem to confirm his guilt. But FBI assistant director Nick Memphis has his doubts - and calls on former Marine Corps sniper Bob Lee Swagger to investigate. As Swagger digs deeper, it becomes clear that matters are more complicated than would initially appear. The shots were not executed with the scope of a 1972 rifle, Hitchcock's weapon of choice, but by a high-tech scope used by active Marines. But as Swagger starts to unravel the tangled web of connections surrounding the murders, he finds his own days may be numbered. Because he's about to face one of his most ruthless adversaries yet - a sniper whose keen intellect and pinpoint accuracy rivals his own. The end result will be a bloody confrontation that only one of them can survive.	2010-03-01	Simon & Schuster, Limited						ZZZ000000

9781841154763	The Rest Is Noise,Listening to the Twentieth Century	Alex Ross		Winner of the Guardian First Book Award 2008A sweeping musical history that goes from the salons of pre-war Vienna to Velvet Underground shows in the sixties.In THE REST IS NOISE Alex Ross, music critic of the New Yorker, gives us a riveting tour of the wild landscape of twentieth-century classical music: portraits of individuals, cultures, and nations reveal the predicament of the composer in a noisy, chaotic century. Taking as his starting point a production of Richard Strauss's Salome, conducted by the composer on 16 May 1906 with Puccini, Schoenberg, Berg and Adolf Hitler seated in the stalls, Ross suggests how this evening can be considered the century's musical watershed rather than the riotous premiere of Stravinsky's Rite of Spring seven years later. Ross goes on to explore the mythology of modernism, Sibelius and the music of small countries, Kurt Weill, the music of the Third Reich, Britten, Boulez and the post-war avant-garde, and interactions between minimalist composers and rock bands in the sixties and seventies.	2009-03-05	HarperCollins Publishers Limited						ZZZ000000

9780007271221	Azincourt	Bernard Cornwell		An extraordinary and dramatic depiction of the legendary battle of Agincourt from the number one historical novelistAzincourt, fought on October 25th 1415, St Crispin's Day, is one of Englandās best-known battles, in part through the brilliant depiction of it in Shakespeare's Henry V, in part because it was a brilliant and unexpected English victory and in part because it was the first battle won by the use of the longbow - a weapon developed by the English which enabled them to dominate the European battlefields for the rest of the century.Bernard Cornwellās Azincourt is a vivid, breathtaking and meticulously well-researched account of this momentous battle and its aftermath. From the varying viewpoints of nobles, peasants, archers, and horsemen, Azincourt skilfully brings to life the hours of relentless fighting, the desperation of an army crippled by disease and the exceptional bravery of the English soldiers.	2009-06-11	HarperCollins Publishers Limited						ZZZ000000

9780007328673	I Am Fifteen and I Do Not Want to Die,The True Story of a Young Woman's Wartime Survival	Christine Arnothy		The compelling and moving narrative of a young girl caught by the tides of marching armies during the siege of Budapest in 1945.Told with calm compulsive force, and with an intimacy and maturity that defies the author's youth, I am fifteen is a poignant coming-of-age memoir, and a remarkable tale of ordinary lives destroyed by war.Budapest in early 1945: the siege - which was to kill some 40,000 civilians - raged around Christine Arnothy, her family and the various inhabitants of their building. Hiding in cellars, venturing out in a desperate search for food and water only when the noise of battle momentarily receded, they wondered if the Germans from the West or the Russians from the East would be victorious and under which they would fare best.Praying she would survive, and mourning the loss of some of her fellow refugees, Christine found solace in her writing - in pencil on a small notepad in the cellar - and dreamt of becoming a writer at the end of the war.Her subsequent adventures include a dramatic escape over the frontier into Austria, to Vienna and freedom (or so she imagined); then the difficult decision to leave her parents in an Allied refugee camp, while she searched for a new life in Paris.	2010-06-01	HarperCollins Publishers Limited						HIS037000

With a new Foreword by the celebrated astronaut Neil Armstrong.'Sobel has done the impossible and made horology sexy - no mean feat' New ScientistAnyone alive in the 18th century would have known that 'the longitude problem' was the thorniest scientific dilemma of the day - and had been for centuries. Lacking the ability to measure their longitude, sailors throughout the great ages of exploration had been literally lost at sea as soon as they lost sight of land. Thousands of lives, and the increasing fortunes of nations, hung on a resolution.The quest for a solution had occupied scientists and their patrons for the better part of two centuries when, in 1714, Parliament upped the ante by offering a king's ransom (Ł20,000) to anyone whose method or device proved successful. Countless quacks weighed in with preposterous suggestions. The scientific establishment throughout Europe - from Galileo to Sir Isaac Newton - had mapped the heavens in both hemispheres in its certain pursuit of a celestial answer. In stark contrast, one man, John Harrison, dared to imagine a mechanical solution.Full of heroism and chicanery, brilliance and the absurd, LONGITUDE is also a fascinating brief history of astronomy, navigation and clockmaking.	2005	Harper Perennial						ZZZ000000

9780007323319	I Know This Much,From Soho to Spandau	Gary Kemp		'I Know This Much' ' by Gary Kemp, Spandau Ballet's prime mover ' is simply the freshest, most exciting and best-written memoir to arrive for years.Gary's story begins in North London, where the Kemp family rented a home with no bathrooms and chickens in the yard. After a couple of failed attempts to kill his brother Martin, his parents gave him a guitar for Christmas.From schoolyard battles between the Bowie Boys and the Prog Rockers to Mrs Kemp's firm insistence on net curtains, and from acting for the Children's Film Foundation to manning a fruit and veg stall on Saturdays, Gary brilliantly evokes an upbringing full of love, creativity and optimism.As the Thatcher years begin, Gary's account of the outrageous London club scene centred around the Blitz and Billy's is just sizzling. Out of this glamorous mayhem of kilt-wearing mascara'd peacocks would emerge Spandau Ballet ' the band that would define the era, and hold high the victorious standard of the New Romantics.Gary's thrilling journey with Spandau Ballet would see them record worldwide hits such as 'True', 'Gold' and 'Through the Barricades', play the biggest stadiums in the world and take to the stage in togas when their luggage gets lost in flight. Stallions, supermodels and dwarves would be hired for video shoots, and through it all, Gary records the wonderful friendships, and the slowly-building tensions, that would eventually see five old friends facing each other in court.'I Know This Much' tells the story of Spandau Ballet, but it's far more than a book about being in a band. Whether it's meeting Ronnie Kray before filming 'The Krays', sketching out the fashions and subcultures of the day, or hanging out with Princess Diana, this book offers a story on every page. And all the more so because it's all written ' brilliantly ' by Gary himself.	2010	HarperCollins Publishers Limited						ZZZ000000
9780007259809	This Little Britain,How One Small Country Changed the Modern World	Harry Bingham		Celebratory, witty and incredibly insightful, Harry Bingham explores the eccentricities and customs of the British nation in a bid to answer a question which has everyone debating ā Who are we?For the British, āWho are we?ā is an oddly difficult question. Although our national self-assessment usually notes a number of good points (weāre inventive, tolerant and at least weāre not French), it lists a torrent of bad ones too. Our society is fragmented and degenerate. Our kids are thugs, our workers ill-educated, our public services abysmal. We drink too much. Our house prices are crazy, our politicians sleazy, our roads jammed, our football team rubbish. When āThe Timesā invited readers to suggest new designs for the backs of British coins, one reader wrote in saying, āHow about a couple of yobs dancing on a car bonnet or a trio of legless ladettes in the gutter?āIs there really nothing to be proud of? British inventors have been responsible for myriad marvels we now take for granted, from the steam engine to the world wide web. British medical and public health innovations ā vaccination, integrated mains sewerage, antiseptic surgery ā have saved far more lives than all other medical innovations put together. And why stop there? The British empire covered a quarter of the earthās surface but used an army smaller than that of Switzerland to exert its rule. The world speaks our language. Our scientists have won vast numbers of Nobel Prizes. The evolution of āhabeas corpusā, trial by jury and the abolition of torture arenāt purely British in inspiration, but owe more to us than to anyone else. Our parliamentary democracy has been hugely influential in spreading ideals of liberty and representative government round the world.If the modern world is richer, freer, more peaceful, more democratic and healthier than it was, then Britain has played a leading role in that transformation. This book is about just that. Taking a particular interest in the many things that we did first, or best, or most, or were the only ones ever to do, this book focuses especially on those of our oddities that spread across the world ā everything from football to the rule of law.	2009-05-29	Harper Collins Publ.

Maureen O'Sullivan, his Jane, died in 1998. Weissmuller's son, who first played Boy in the 1939 film 'Tarzan Finds a Mate', has gone too. But Cheeta the Chimp, who starred with them all, is alive and well, retired in Palm Springs as an abstract painter. At the incredible age of seventy-six, he is by far the oldest living chimpanzee ever recorded.Now, in this extraordinary debut novel, James Lever uncovers the astonishing tale of Cheeta'ŚCheeta was just a baby when snatched from the Liberian jungle in 1932, by the great animal importer Henry Trefflich, who went on to supply NASA with its 'Monkeys for Space' programme. That same year, Cheeta appeared in 'Tarzan the Ape Man', and in 1934 'Tarzan and His Mate', in which he famously stole the clothes from a naked O'Sullivan, dripping wet from an underwater swimming scene with Weissmuller.Full of humour, wit and emotion, James Lever's novel tells the truly unique tale of a monkey stolen from deepest Africa and forced to make a living among the fake jungles and outrageous stars of Hollywood's golden age. Cheeta's tinseltown journey extends beyond the screen, to his struggle with drink and addiction to cigars, his breakthrough with a radical new form of abstract painting, 'Apeism', his touching relationship with his retired nightclub-performing grandson Jeeta, now a considerable artist in his own right, his fondness for hamburgers and his battle in later life with diabetes, and, through thick and thin, carer Dan Westfall, his loving companion who has helped this magnificent monkey come to terms with his peculiar past.Funny, moving ' and so searingly honest, you know it has to be fiction ' 'Me Cheeta' transports us back to a lost Hollywood. Cheeta is a real star, and this is the greatest celebrity non-memoir of recent times'Ś	2009-05-28	Harper Collins Publ. UK						ZZZ000000

9780330487047	The mystic masseur	V. S. Naipaul		In this slyly funny and lavishly inventive novel-his first-V. S. Naipaul traces the unlikely career of Ganesh Ramsumair, a failed schoolteacher and impecunious village masseur who in time becomes a revered mystic, a thriving entrepreneur, and the most beloved politician in Trinidad. To understand a little better, one has to realize that in the 1940s masseurs were the island's medical practitioners of choice. As one character observes, "I know the sort of doctors they have in Trinidad. They think nothing of killing two, three people before breakfast." Ganesh's ascent is variously aided and impeded by a Dickensian cast of rogues and eccentrics. There's his skeptical wife, Leela, whose schooling has made her excessively, fond. of; punctuation: marks!; and Leela's father, Ramlogan, a man of startling mood changes and an ever-ready cutlass. There's the aunt known as The Great Belcher. There are patients pursued by malign clouds or afflicted with an amorous fascination with bicycles. Witty, tender, filled with the sights, sounds, and smells of Trinidad's dusty Indian villages, The Mystic Masseur is Naipaul at his most expansive and evocative.	2001-10-01	Picador						ZZZ000000
