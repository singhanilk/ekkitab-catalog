Drawing upon the classic theories of Marx, Weber and Michels as well as more contemporary developments in organizational theory, Abrahamsson presents his unique theory - that organizations are deliberately designed social structures which have been established by a certain person, group or class in order to implement certain goals.The Logic of Organizations focuses on three critical problem areas of organizations: how to make organizations more efficient; how to make organizations more representative of the interests and objectives of their founders; and how to relieve the problems of b	1993	Sage Publications						ZZZ000000
9780803950412	Why organizations?,how and why people organize	Bengt Abrahamsson		"Why Organizations? is an intriguing title and very much deserves our attention. The author, Professor Bengt Abrahamsson, is a well-known Swedish organizational sociologist, with wide experience of the world of work easily apparent in his book, a concise introduction to the theory of organizations. . . . One of the merits of the author's approach is that he combines a knowledge of both Anglo-American literatures with the Continental and Scandinavian approaches, the latter being one of his specialties as Director of the Swedish Center for Working Life in Stockholm. It is a sound, reflective book. . . . The chapters on the free-rider problem, transaction costs, and the organizational process do . . . deserve special mention and are rather well done." --Journal of General Management "Expertly crafted and rich in detail, Why Organizations? leads readers on a frequently surprising journey. Abrahamsson draws upon work that spans time, discipline, and continent to create a diverse and comprehensive analysis. . . . Abrahamsson's is a uniquely integrated perspective that should fascinate and provoke sociologists and economists alike--as well as inspire some debate among them. . . . Why Organizations? presents a useful and critical synthesis of sociological and economic organization theory. . . . Students in economics and sociology, particularly those with special interests in antiorganization theory and industrial democracy, will find something of value or worthy of debate in this book." --Contemporary Sociology "Bengt Abrahamsson here performs a great service by excavating an underlying stability beneath the baffling social fluctuations of the past 30 years. . . . It is a great contribution of the present volume to bring us back to the fundamental question of the function of organization, scraping away the encrustations of ideological distortion and wishful thinking. In the process Abrahamsson draws our attention to some of the vital functions of formal structure. . . . Abrahamsson goes not only out far but also in deep using these broad aspects of the problem of organization. A great deal of bunk is debunked and much ground is cleared. . . . there may well be something to the notion of network forms which is emerging in the sociological literature. But whatever explorations are taken in this direction will first have to absorb the lessons of Abrahamsson's analysis here, and pay attention to the universals of organization which he so effectively brings to light." --from the Foreword by Charles C. Heckscher Why do organizations exist? Why can't the market--free contracts between single buyers and sellers--solve all production and distribution problems? What are the causes behind the rise of industrial enterprises and other hierarchies? Why Organizations? goes beyond the basics of organizational theory to discuss these and other questions. Abrahamsson deftly surveys the conditions for the emergence of hierarchy, bureaucracy, and democracy in organizations--and why organizations exist and if their existence is at all necessary. Abrahamsson frames his discussion in rationalistic organization theory based on such concepts as rationality, interest, power, form and function, external forces and inner logic, and organizational mandators and executives. This ground-breaking study is a must-read for professionals, researchers, instructors, and students of organizational studies, management, sociology, political science, and education.	1993	Sage Publications						ZZZ000000

It brought together a wide range of issues centering on environmental, health and personal risk, provided a rallying ground for researchers and activists in a variety of social movements and acted as a reference point for state and local policies in risk management. The Risk Society and Beyond charts the progress of Beck's ideas and traces their evolution. It demonstrates why the issues raised by Beck reverberate widely throughout social theory and covers the new risks that Beck did not foresee, associated with the emergence of new technologies, genetic and cybernetic. The book is unique because it offers both an introduction to the main arguments in Risk Society and develops a range of critical discussions of aspects of this and other works of Beck.	2000	SAGE						ZZZ000000

9780803975224	Gender issues in elder abuse	Lynda Aitken&Gabriele Griffin		Filling a gap on the existing literature on elder abuse and gender, Gender Issues in Elder Abuse analyzes the ways in which gender is central to the occurrence, detection, and prevention of elder abuse. The authors identify the gendered nature of elder abuse and contend that most elderly victims are women and that in domestic and in institutional settings women abuse women. They also argue that a significant number of older women are abused by their sons, a significant number of older men are abused by their female partners and daughters, and abuse occurs by both sexes of nonrelatives and noncarers. This groundbreaking volume considers why much of the research on elder abuse has failed to engage with these facts. The authors call for a reframing of the issue of elder abuse, specifically in professional guidelines for dealing with abuse which, they insist, should include gender awareness. They argue for elder abuse to be considered as a human rights issue rather than a private problem. This book will be essential reading for academics, students, and professionals in social work, social policy, women's studies, and gerontology.	1996-10-17	SAGE						ZZZ000000

9780803981553	Television and its audience	Patrick Barwise&A. S. C. Ehrenberg		This book by two leading experts takes a fresh look at the nature of television, starting from an audience perspective. It draws on over twenty years of research about the audience in the United States and Britain and about the many ways in which television is funded and organized around the world.  The overall picture which emerges is of: a medium which is watched for several hours a day but usually at only a low level of involvement; an audience which views mainly for relaxation but which actively chooses favourite programmes; a flowering of new channels but with no fundamental change in what or how people watch; programmes costing millions to produce but only a few pennies to view; a wide range of programme types apparently similar to the range of print media but with nothing like the same degree of audience 'segmentation'; a global communication medium of dazzling scale, speed, and impact but which is slow at conveying complex information and perhaps less powerful than generally assumed.  The book is packed with information and insights yet is highly readable. It is unique in relating so many of the issues raised by television to how we watch it. There is also a highly regarded appendix on advertising, as well as technical notes, a glossary, and references for further reading.	1988	Sage						ZZZ000000
9780803951273	Conducting research in the practice setting	Martin J. Bass		In Conducting Research in the Practice Setting, a multidisciplinary team of contributors representing such fields as family medicine, nursing, social work, epidemiology, and anthropology identify the methods and elements necessary for conducting successful research in the primary care setting. The volume first concentrates on such general issues of primary care research as the ethics of conducting research with human subjects. Next, the contributors examine practical questions such as combining clinical care and research, recruiting patients, maximizing use of the office computer, and identifying the needs of the surrounding community. Collaborations--a topic of increasing importance--between nurse and physician, university and community, and industry and clinician are explored. Special settings relevant to primary care are also discussed. For example, such settings as rural native communities, the homeless, and long-term care are addressed in terms of the challenges they present. The appendix includes a checklist for conducting research in the practice setting. Primary care physicians and nurses interested in conducting research as part of their practice as well as academics and advance students in these areas will find this and other volumes in the series invaluable. "Like its companions in this excellent series, this text makes a significant contribution in assisting researchers in conducting important and high quality research in the challenging arena of primary care. This volume also gives insight into the rich contributions a number of individuals have made to advancing our understanding of practice-based research in ambulatory primary care. . . . The text is directly applicable to physicians from all specialties who are contemplating becoming involved in, or who are already actively involved in, scientific inquiry in practice settings. . . . The authors provide insight not only into the study of the processes and treatments of illnesses, but also into the depth and diversity of doctor-patient relationships, the determinants of physician's own behaviors, and better vantages over the etiologies and natural histories of human diseases. . . . Readers will find many pearls of wisdom for recruiting patients from private practice, potentially unlimited mixtures of quantitative and qualitative designs for inquiry, and caveats for considering cultural belief systems and understanding compliance issues. . . . [This book] soundly achieves its goal of meeting the needs of primary care researchers." --Academic Medicine "Far more comprehensive than other publications on the subject. . . . This volume provides an excellent introduction for clinic-based primary care physicians beginning to do research, as well as providing valuable background for an experienced researcher considering initiating a project in a primary care setting for the first time. Conducting Research in the Practice Setting is readable and motivating. It does not allow problems of this type of research to dampen the enthusiasm of persons who recognize the value and potential of practice-based research. As an introduction to the field of practice-based research, it is eminently affordable, it is not overpowering in length or difficulty, and presents a valuable perspective on the conduct of practice-based research in the real world. There should also be a place for this book on the shelves of all teachers of family medicine and other disciplines who have an interest in clinic-based research." --The Journal of Family Practice "Finally: A book on conducting research in the practice setting! The title will immediately interest anyone involved in primary care research. Readers will not be disappointed. . . . The editors have done a superb job of ensuring that the result is at a consistently high level throughout. . . . The organization of the book allows readers to dip into chapters or sections as the need arises. . . . The book is very practical. This practicality is reflected best in the many useful checklists and guides found throughout. Second, this volume contains the personal research experiences of many of many of the authors. I found that their own stories of success and failure enriched the points they made and the reading itself. I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It is a must (as is the series) for all primary care researchers, whether novice or expert. There are clearly benefits to owning this whole series, including using the references providedin the checklist for conducting research in practice (appendix). Purchasing this series is probably less than the cost of a reference-type textbook. I also recommend this particular volume to community-based physicians not involved in research, but wondering whether they should be." --Canadian Family Physician "Martin Bass and his colleagues have assembled another volume in this remarkable series that will guide the research needed to improve the care most people receive for most of the problems that affect them most of the time. This volume will assist researchers to develop the scientific underpinnings of primary care practice and outlines a wide variety of methods that can be matched to the relevant questions of primary care." --Paul A. Nutting, M.D., M.S.P.H., Professor of Family Medicine and Director, Ambulatory Sentinel Practice Network, Denver, Colorado "This book should have wide appeal. . . . [It] fills a void. . . . [It is] written by 25 authors and 5 editors who have a wide range of talent and experience. They present the material in a comprehensive fashion. . . . This book is necessary. . . it is recommended for anyone wishing to do research within the practice setting." --Annals of Internal Medicine	1993-07-22	Sage Publications						ZZZ000000

9780761953241	The classical tradition in sociology,the European tradition	Raymond Boudon&Mohamed Cherkaoui&Jeffrey C. Alexander		This four-volume set presents an unrivalled collection of the key literature in European sociology. The prestigious texts range across the European tradition from enlightenment to contemporary theory. The collection explodes the myth that the European tradition in sociology is a debate with the ghosts of Karl Marx and Max Weber, demonstrating that the tradition is far more deeply rooted and broadly based.  Volume 1 is devoted to the emergence of European sociology. The contribution of classical political economy and the Enlightenment is examined. Commentaries on the work of Hobbes, Locke, Montesquieu, Taine, Rousseau, de Tocqueville, Comte and St. Simon are included. The volume creates a vivid and compelling picture of the origins of European sociology.  Volume 2 covers the rise of the classical period in social theory. It includes commentaries on the contribution of Marx, Spencer, Dilthey, Weber, Durkheim and Simmel. An overview of the main contributions of the founding fathers is also included.  Volume 3 moves on to explore the main developments in the first half of the twentieth century. The contributions of the Durkheimian Tradition, Mauss, Mannheim, Lukacs, Gramsci and British sociology are presented. The volume provides a synoptic view of the diversity and emerging complexity of European sociology.  Volume 4 identifies the main developments from post-industrial theory to the present day. The volume includes commentaries on the work of Aron, Foucault, Habermas, Giddens, Bourdieu, Boudon and Gellner. Selections on structuralism, polysemy, the positivist dispute and the neo-liberal tradition widen out the picture.  The collection is the benchmark work for understanding the history, contribution and dilemmas of the European tradition. Full account is taken of the reference needs of students as well as of academics.   Each hardcover volume of 416 pages is bound to the highest standards. The lettering on the cover is gold embossed. The slip case for the four volumes is also embossed. The volumes are not available separately.	1997	Sage						ZZZ000000
9780761973423	Nurture groups in school,principles and practice	Marjorie Boxall		'In her book, Marjorie Boxall makes an eloquent case for establishing nurture provision. Her book would be invaluable for teachers, governors and other interested parties in helping them to provide more appropriately for such children' - Young Minds Magazine 'This book should be essential reading for Government ministers. The author pioneered the setting up of nurture groups in Inner London in the early 1970s as a response to social deprivation and its consequences for children in school. The book describes why and how, drawing on those early experiences and later projects in the London Borough of Enfield. It is salutary to note that the concept of nurture group is now well over thirty years old and as yet there are still very few of them in existence. Hopefully Marjorie Boxall's book will help to change this situation. As she says: 'Our capital of good nurture is diminishing fast and the fabric of society is at risk, for with each generation there are fewer people...to provide good nurturing, and more children who have been deprived of it.' Nurture groups provide children with social and emotional experiences that are necessary as a pre-requisite for formal school learning. Marjorie Boxall describes how such children are functionally below the age of three, due to having missed out on essential experiences, which are normally provided through mothering. Adults who work in a nurture group setting provide a variety of structured experiences: for example, how to play with toys, how to share a meal, so that the children 'catch up' on their social and emotional development and can then rejoin mainstream education. This is a very practical and readable book that serves as a comprehensive introduction to the subject. This book is a bible for nurture group enthusiasts and should be essential reading for anybody who has the desire to make a significant impact in the area of social change. Copies, please, to Tony Blair, Estelle Morris and to every Chief Education Officer in the United Kingdom. They ignore it at their peril' - Nurturing Potential 'Marjorie is the originator of nurture groups. Her book is full of wisdom about the work of nurture groups, why people do what they do, how to think about the situation children are in and what nurture group staff can do about it. This is an authoritative practice manual, clearly informed by years of reflective practice and experience. Insights into childhood and school life abound. If your main interest is as a practitioner or directly supporting those who work with children, you will find it full of interest and richness. Marjorie's book fills the gap between theory and the reality of doing the job. Applied psychology at its best. An essential addition to the nurture group bookcase' - Marion Bennathan, Director, Nurture Group Network 'This powerful and immensely positive book describes the rationale and practice of nurture groups for children who cannot cope with the demands of mainstream primary school' - Jennie Lindon, Nursery World 'If your school is thinking of setting up a nurture group, this book is clearly essential reading. It is also likely, however, to be of interest to a wider readership, especially since a commitment to social inclusion is at the heart of current policy on early education and childcare in Britain' - Margaret Bryson, International Journal of Early Years Education 'This book is not only a useful resource to the NG practitioner; it is also a document that tells us a lot about what of value has been all but lost from the educational agenda in recent years, and more importantly, something about one of the ways we might go about restoring the loss. The emphasis throughout is on dealing with pupils as whole persons. This involves mee	2002	Paul Chapman						ZZZ000000

This collection provides an important forum for debate around the issues of audiences, women's culture, and television theory, and, as such, deserves close and critical reading." --Canadian Journal of Communication "The individual authors represent a fine range of international perspectives and address topics that range from traditionally women-identified genres of television, such as soap operas and game shows, to a surprisingly fresh inquiry into women's reception of a male-identified television spectacle, Australian-rules football. . . . All 12 essays fulfill the promise of the cultural studies mission to isolate and elevate subcultural resistance strategies. . . . The book includes an excellent, extensive bibliography of current research in cultural studies and women audiences. . . . Television and Women's Culture is a significant collection. It challenges and expands research agendas in media studies and foregrounds voices and subcultural communities formerly silenced both by dominant culture and in our own research. As a supplemental text in media courses or a reference source for researchers, it could function to stimulate fresh questions about the multiple dimensions of the relationship between television and its viewers, especially the gendered dimensions of our media habits." --Quarterly Journal of Speech "There are sophisticated, persuasive chapters which apply contemporary theorizing to popular culture. . . .The essays hang together as convincing demonstration of how women, while still functioning within the dominant economic and social order, can and sometimes do appropriate television texts for their own affective and political purposes." --Journalism Quarterly "Though [the contributors] recognize that television frequently distorts and oppresses women's experience, the authors eschew a simplistic manipulative view of the media. Instead they show how and why such different genres as game shows, police fiction and soap opera offer women opportunities for negotiation of their own meanings and their own aesthetic appreciation." --Gender & Mass Media "[One] of four important titles . . . advancing insights on contemporary issues. . . . Probing and critical." --The Bookwatch "A refreshing collection of theoretical and critical works examining the impact of women and women's culture on television. . . . An excellent guide to promote critical thinking and new approaches to the study of television and women's culture. . . . A good classroom resource for the study of women and media . . . and . . . a good addition to the body of research needed for the inclusion of multicultural education in the curriculum." --Journal of Broadcasting and Electronic Media "Well-written and well-conceptualized. . . . Those interested in the feminist perspective in media studies will find this volume valuable. The essays are highly readable. The ideas presented are challenging and offer refreshing insights." --Et Cetera: Journal of General Semantics "An engaging, informative collection of essays . . . fresh, original. . . . The book provides food for thought on how to produce as well as consume television content without perpetuating gender inequities." --Women and Language "Useful to undergraduate and graduate students of women's studies, mass communications, and cultural studies. The introduction provides a succinct explanation of the theoretical groundings of this growing body of research. Clear definitions of terminology are found throughout the volume, making this book accessible to those unschooled in feminist theory. . . . Provides much-needed examples of feminist television content analysis." --Choice "Brown incisively frames these essays with a lucid and straightforward introduction and conclusion. . . . Provocative reading for anyone interested in what is going on in cultural studies . . . the essays work together quite coherently." --Contemporary Sociology	1990	Sage Publications						ZZZ000000

Brubaker		As the social world of American families feverishly changes, single-parent families, dual-career couples, and blended families have quickly become the norm rather than the exception. In Family Relations, a distinguished group of leading family researchers including Joan Huber, David Olson, Hamilton McCubbin, and Marilyn Coleman examines the social changes that have gripped society and explains their impact on family relationships and functioning. Initial chapters address principal theories of change; the remainder of the volume addresses the predominant challenges facing contemporary families such as work/family interface, violence, family dysfunction, family crisis, divorce, and the transition to marriage and parenthood. The contributors make suggestions for change in family policy, family therapy, and family life education, and conclude with an overview of the current state of families and future directions. This comprehensive and interesting volume is for students, family researchers, sociologists, psychologists, counselors, family life educators, and policy analysts. "True to its aim it informs about the latest understandings and tools of intervention to help overcome the formidable challenges to the family....there is some worthy scholarship to be found in this volume....chapter 3 on gender and role change is a lively and readable summary." --British Journal of Social Work "[This volume] has much to offer. For example, the volume contains demographic information often needed by practitioners and policymakers at a moment's notice. Literature reviews not only summarize research on a particular topic but also are organized around a theoretical framework. Well-known authors have contributed scholarly, insightful commentaries on current family issues and challenges for the future. In short, this book provides information that practitioners and policymakers could use to do the following: establish the need and rationale for programming and applied research, justify the expenditure of funds for children and families, ground their work in theory and research, conduct in-service education, and consider program evaluation strategies. . . . This book is well-written and provides a valuable resource for the intended readership. I look forward to the second volume." --Journal of Marriage and the Family	1993	SAGE Publications						ZZZ000000

Clark		"The book provides a wealth of statistically-based evidence to substantiate or repudiate important arguments and assumptions central to the radical changes that are occurring in cities and municipal government." --Max Barlow in Journal of Economic and Social Geography More and more often, city governments operate under turbulent conditions: severe cutbacks in grants from national governments, drop in voter turnouts, taxpayer revolts, and a population of dissatisfied citizens. Urban Innovation addresses these issues by exploring how cities can innovate in the face of such challenges. Based on survey data from the Fiscal Austerity and Innovation Project, this volume reassesses theories of political leadership and government decision making, discusses the ways that cities have made innovations over the past decade, and reviews 33 specific strategies and their results. Some of the other issues this volume addresses are race and class, the growth and decline of city governments, and the intergovernmental aid cutbacks made during the Reagan administration. The turbulence of the past two decades is critical in reshaping our way of thinking about how governments work. Urban Innovation will be useful for students, faculty, and professionals in urban studies, political science, and policy studies.	1994	Sage Publications						ZZZ000000
9780803977686	Managing social policy	John Clarke&Allan Cochrane&Eugene McLaughlin		This innovative text offers an assessment of the role of management in the restructuring of social welfare in contemporary Britain.In the transformation of the welfare state since the 1970s, management has been accorded a central role. New forms and ideas of management have had profound consequences for: the organization and delivery of public services; the political processes of policy formation; systems of accountability; and the experiences both of the recipients of services and of those working within public sector organizations.

9780803976115	The managerial state,power, politics and ideology in the remaking of social welfare	John Clarke&Janet Newman		Authors John Clarke and Janet Newman present an original analysis of the creation of new state forms that critically examines the political forces that enabled "more and better management" to be presented as a solution to the problems of the welfare state in Britain. Examining the micro-politics of change within public services, the authors draw links among politics, policies, and organizational power to present an incisive and dynamic account of the restructuring of social welfare. Clarke and Newman expose the tensions and contradictions in the managerial state and trace the emergence of new dilemmas in the provision of public services. They show that these problems are connected to the recurring difficulties in defining the "the public" that receives these services. In particular they question whether the reinvention of the public as either a nation of consumers or a nation of communities can effectively address the implications of social diversity. A cogent critique of the social, political, and organizational conflicts and instabilities that are embedded in new state forms, The Managerial State will be essential reading for students and academics in social policy, public policy, and public management. It will also be of interest to academics in sociology, politics, and organization studies.	1997	Sage						ZZZ000000

I highly recomend it.' - British journal of Clinical Psychology  With a focus on clinical psychology, this book explores the challenges and confusions generated by postmodernism. Identifying contemporary concerns in clinical practice and seeking responses to current questions, the book asks: Are professionals really self-serving individuals pretending to be altruistic? Are ethics the guarantor of good practice in a post-scientific age? How can we recognize and train the ethical practitioner? What models of practice will be useful in the future?  Critical Issues in Clinical Practice sets an agenda for all researchers in clinical practice seeking key topics and themes, an agenda that promises clarity to practitioners bludgeoned by the rapid turnover of ideas that is postmodern culture. It challenges both researchers, practitioners and students to reach beyond the celebration of diversity, to consider how to construct new alliances and purpose.	1998	SAGE Publications						ZZZ000000

The students' school experience must acknowledge the daily influence of the family in the classroom. To ignore this `hidden link' is to remain ignorant about students' lives and motivations, and makes it very difficult for educators to improve schools and schooling. Based on extensive research, Parent, Student and Teacher Collaboration provides invaluable guidance and insight.	1998	Corwin Press						ZZZ000000

Reformulating the issues raised by STS within the context of technical communication, Scientific and Technical Communication is composed of three highly integrated parts. Part I provides a summary, critique, and alternative to recent theoretical perspectives developed in the rhetoric of science and the sociology of scientific knowledge.

This hands-on, introductory textbook will supply students and professionals in the areas of scientific and technical communication, rhetoric, and media studies with broad-based and applicable knowledge in this area.	1997	Sage Publications						ZZZ000000

9780803925502	Max Weber,a skeleton key	Randall Collins		A concise overview of sociology's greatest classic thinker. Weber emerges as a multisided intellectual personality, whose intellectual ambivalence is related to a neurotic breakdown in mid career and to the compromises he was forced to make among the conflicting politievanscal and intellectual currents of his time. Here we see what kinds of philosophical idealism Weber favored and what kinds he rejected, as well as his position on the "battle of methods" among the economists of his day. Weber's famous "Protestant Ethic" thesis is put in proper perspective as an intellectual gambit in one particular period of his life, rather than as his central achievement. Weber's overall view of social change is examined, drawing on several of his crucial but little-known works, on the sociology of ancient agrarian societies and on the long chain of organizational conditions that finally led to modern capitalism. Also treated are Weber's major works on the sociology of religion and his contributions to systematic theory, especially social stratification. The many strands of Weber's theorizing, and his tremendous scope of comparisons across world history, are here brought into a clear and manageable focus. "Randall Collins is the leading sociological theorist of his generation. He has also done more than anyone else to use and develop Weberian sociology. Accordingly we expect much from Collins on Weber and Max Weber does not disappoint." --Whitney Pope, Indiana University "A lively, efficient, reliable interpretation, captivating for the novice, provocative for the expert. . . . Typical Collins." --Alan Sica, University of Kansas "A good introductory survey of Weber's major writings.

It takes ideas about risk (as expressed by sociologists such as Ulrich Beck in Risk Society), and applies them to recent changes in welfare. The author shows neo-liberals have used various aspects of risk to attack welfare dependency, and how various rhetoric's of risk have been used to reshape contemporary politics.  Social Policy and Risk makes a major contribution to our understanding of contemporary welfare politics.	1999	Sage						ZZZ000000

9780761995890	War and diplomacy in Kashmir, 1947-48	C. Dasgupta		Based on declassified documents, the book throws new light on the roles played by Mountbatten and the British service chiefs in the Kashmir war of 1947-48 and explains why India took the Kashmir issue to the UN, why it did not carry the war into Pakistan and why it accepted a ceasefire. Examining archival material that has not been looked at previously and attempting an important reassessment of Mountbatten's role, the book highlights the fact that India's first Governor-General was not a mere constitutional figurehead. The book shows that he used -- and abused -- this authority to ensure that the conflict in Kashmir did not escalate into a full-scale inter-dominion war.  A study of British policy in Kashmir must begin with an examination of the strategic interests of Britain in the subcontinent. The book explains the diplomatic background to the military developments of the time, tracing the evolution of British policy on Kashmir and its orchestration of the moves of western powers in the Security Council. The book provides details from the British archives about the secret understandings between Commanders-in-Chief of the rival armies to contain the conflict. It reveals, for instance, that India's Commander-in-Chief, General Bucher, had tried as early as March 1948 to negotiate an informal truce with his counterpart in Pakistan, without the knowledge of the Indian government. A revealing study about a controversial incident in India's military history, this is a timely book, especially in the post-Agra Summit period.  This book analyses:  The Evolution of British policy towards Kashmir  The role played by the western powers in the Security council  The secret attempt made by General Bucher to negotiate an informal truce with his counterpart in Pakistan  How Mountbatten used and abused his authority to ensure that the Kashmir issue did not escalate into a full-scale inter-domain war.	2002	Sage						ZZZ000000

9780803943674	The NORC general social survey,a user's guide	James Allan Davis&Tom William Smith		"When someone goes public with a simple, straightforward, good idea, the audience usually scratches its collective head and wonders why no one thought of it before. That was my reaction as I read James A. Davis and Tom W. Smith's short volume on the General Social Survey (GSS), the first of a new Sage series on major social science data bases. . . . I suspect there isn't a GSS user out there who wouldn't learn quite a bit from reading this book. . . . The knowledge it provides is partly historical, partly practical, and partly inspirational. . . . The practical sections make up a very readable and thorough discussion of its study design. . . . The inspirational part of the book, at least for me is Davis and Smith's narrative on the variety of studies and collaborative activity that make the GSS a unique source for comparative, historical, methodological, and cross-sectional research. . . . For those who wonder whether their interesting questions have been answered in previous research, Davis and Smith provide basic guidelines for finding out who has done what with the GSS." --Contemporary Sociology "This series will lead to more informed analysis of existing data sources as well as more insightful interpretation of studies based on them (for series quote). . . . In this superb first volume for the series, James A. Davis and Tom W. Smith have provided a lucid introduction to the history, philosophy, sampling design, and evolving content of the General Social Survey (GSS). . . . This guide conveys with both cogency and liveliness the major features of the GSS. . . . The chapter on sampling design, which describes both the shift from a block-quota modified probability sample to a full probability sample and the switch from a 1970 sample frame to a 1980 sample frame, gives evidence of the commitment to high quality. . . . The book communicates an abiding responsiveness to the emerging data needs of a developing social science. . . . The responsiveness of the GSS to new data needs, amply evident in the book, is one of its most laudable features. . . . It is a tribute to Davis and Smith that their book stimulates the reader not only to order the GSS database straightaway and carry out tests of some intriguing propositions but also to make testable some previously untestable propositions by persuading the GSS to collect information on the propositions' previously unmeasured parts. This book augurs well for the series." --Journal of the American Statistical Association "All of the questions my methods students have asked over the years (and all I've asked myself) are answered, and then some. . . . The guide is effective in making the data accessible." --Karen Campbell, Vanderbilt University "I think this series is a very good idea. Code books are intimidating for many users, and clear, approachable guides to major social science data sets will be well received. The User's Guide to the GSS . . . will ultimately be such a resource. . . . The section on Design Effects . . . is a very good subject to include in such a guide." --Dan Krymkowski, Dartmouth College "A fine introduction to an invaluable social science data resource." --Judith Tanur, State University of New York, Stony Brook "Should provide helpful assistance to undergraduates whose exposure to the GSS may be their first experience with survey research and quantitative analysis. In addition, it should be a useful tool to more experienced analysts who need to quickly master the intricacies of the GSS." --Microcase Forum For any researcher, student, or teacher using the General Social Survey (GSS), this book is a must. Written by the two researchers who have directed the GSS since its inception in 1972, this practical, easy-to-use volume enables you to exploit this large data set more effectively than ever before. This volume clearly explains the "rotations" and "split ballots" in the study design, describes available samples (including the 1982 and 1987 oversamples of black respondents) and weights, and discusses interviewer training, quality control, validation, and coding procedures. In addition, it outlines the topics covered in the GSS, including the recurrent, replicated "core" items suitable for trend analyses, the annual topical modules on subjects of current interest, and the international modules produced in collaboration with the International Social Survey Program. And, this guidebook covers the various data sets in which GSS data are accessible, and directs you to the data banks that disseminate them. Both novice and experienced GSS users will find The NORC General Social Survey an invaluable tool.	1992	Sage Publications						ZZZ000000

9780803950511	Nonresidential parenting,new vistas in family living	Charlene E. Depner&James H. Bray		With burgeoning numbers of nonresidential parents, how can policymakers and professionals who work with families address the emotional and financial needs of children who do not live with both parents? What resources exist for developing parenting agreements between mothers and fathers who live apart? What should be done when a child refuses to visit the nonresidential parent? What effect does a parent's remarriage have on children? A distinguished roster of scholars addresses these questions by drawing from research, policy, and practice sources to identify the rich array of roles that nonresidential parents may play in the lives of their children. Taking a multidimensional approach that views the family as an entity that changes over time, they also explore such issues as variation in nonresidential parenting across ethnic groups, financial implications of parenting apart, patterns of involvement of nonresidential parents, and children's adjustment to remarriage. Included in each chapter are implications for further research and social policy. This important volume concludes with a chapter that offers new directions for multidimensional approaches to research, policy and practice. Nonresidential Parenting will make compelling reading for researchers, practitioners, and students who work with or study families. "Depner and Bray's collection is especially useful in elaborating its principal contention that a 'monolithic vision of non-residential parenting is a poor basis for policy.'....the book is a competent reflection upon research in the United States." --British Journal of Social work "Consistent with its multidisciplinary approach and its focus on research and application, the book is very readable. It is unique in the ease with which it integrates research, theory, and practice. Yet the text represents a very scholarly approach to the study of these families and related interventions. Major empirical and applied scholarship from a variety of disciplines has been drawn upon to support the book's conclusions and recommendations. This book will be an invaluable resource." --Family Relations	1993-02-04	Sage						ZZZ000000

The Satnamis of central India have combined the features of a caste and a sect to question and challenge the tenor of ritual power that variously defines Hinduism. Combining archival and field work, the book presents an interpretive account of Satnami endeavours, encounters, and experiences - the ethnographic pasts of a numerous community that continues to be a significant presence in the newly constituted state of Chhattisgarh. The book brings together recent analytical departures and significant critical developments within contemporary scholarship in history, anthropology and sociology. By casting these theoretical tendencies in a critical dialogue with one another, the book thinks through some of those overriding oppositions that have formed the conceptual core of social thought and political enquiry in both Western and non-Western contexts.	2001-07-01	Vistaar						ZZZ000000

With a strong focus on the use of research, this book will really appeal to the specific needs of higher-level students.The book covers important material that is often missing in consumer behaviour texts.

9780803988682	The new politics of class,social movements and cultural dynamics in advanced societies	Klaus Eder		Are contemporary societies organized by class? In recent years the apparent fragmentation of established class structures and the emergence of new social movements--in particular the women's movement and environmentalism--have altered the traditional expressions of class in society. At the same time, these changes have posed fundamental questions for the concept of class in sociology and political science. In this major reassessment, Klaus Eder offers a new perspective on the status of class in modernity. Drawing on a critique of Bourdieu, Touraine, and Habermas, he outlines a cultural conception of class as the basis for understanding contemporary societies. His model reevaluates the role of the middle classes, traditionally the crux of class analysis, and links class to social theories of power and cultural capital. The result is a cultural theory of class which incorporates the changing forms of collective action and the new social movements of contemporary societies. An invaluable contribution both to social theory and to the theory of class and stratification, The New Politics of Class will be of interest to a broad readership in sociology and political science. "Given the richness of Klaus Eder's theorizing, there are many ways of reading this volume. . . [His work is] full of provocative conceptual ideas and basically sound insights." --American Journal of Sociology	1993	Sage Publications						ZZZ000000

Now, as the back-to-basics curriculum and standardized modes of evaluation - whose very foundations Elliot W Eisner was questioning a decade ago - are again finding favour with politicians, Eisner has revised his classic work.

Although media policy has changed drastically in its concerns and forms, the contributors here argue that the need for an effective public communication policy in our "information society" is as pressing now as it ever was. Following up the success of the Euromedia Research Group's New Media Politics (1986), and the Dynamics of Media Politics (1992), this third volume in the series offers a timely review and analysis of developments in media and structure.

9780803945807	Understanding older Chicanas	Elisa Facio		Focusing on an overlooked and understudied population, Understanding Older Chicanas examines older Chicanas' lives, status, and public policy needs. Chicana elderly tend to be poor, reflecting the economic position of Chicanos in American society; they also tend to be stereotyped as widows and grandmothers, reflecting the cultural values of Mexican American society. This work shows how Chicana elderly cope with this economic and cultural marginality and how they gain the personal and financial resources they require. Author Elisa Facio also relates how scholars and public policymakers have previously understood Chicana elderly, provides new data on the social meaning of Chicana old age, and points out the implications of that meaning for future policymakers. This perceptive volume is essential reading for those in academic and policy settings who are interested in issues regarding multicultural aging experiences, diversification, life-cycle phases, socialization, and women.	1996	Sage Publications						ZZZ000000

[this book is] a good step in redressing the balance... It is a practical, didactic and generic view of how to do supervision... giving a fairly comprehensive account of 30 of the formal skills that all supervisors probably use whether consciously or not... The book discusses each of the skills, giving examples as well as practical suggestions as to how to approach difficult issues... directed principally at counsellors, it is a book to dip into when faced with a panic about a specific issue' - Therapeutic CommunitiesSupervision is a professional and ethical necessity for all counsellors, providing them with consultative and supportive aid while protecting clients from potential abuse - yet relatively little has been written on the subject. This volume aims to redress that balance.Encouraging, yet sensitive to the difficult issues that frequently arise in supervision, the book contains practical suggestions, plus useful appendices, to help practising and trainee supervisors develop and enhance the skills they need to be successful in their work.

Ease of entry and advancement into state and national politics, however, are shown to vary markedly across the nation. Strategic considerations play an important role in career decisions. Legislators take into account whether or not they will face an incumbent, the quality of likely opponents in primaries, the cost of campaigns, the relative value of their present office versus a higher office, and looming term limits. For example, as a result of term limits on state legislators, patient, highly selective, and successful moves up the political ladder have been replaced by early exits from office and riskier challenges for higher office. Those who are too liberal or conservative for their party and state are less likely to win statewide races. Distance from the winning state party position serve as a key to understanding which senators are reelected and which House members enter and win Senate primaries.

9780761963776	Nature and social theory	Adrian Franklin		This book asks the questions can `Man' be separated from `Nature'? Is it valid to seek to `control' Nature? It argues that the firm modern boundaries between nature and culture have been breached and pulls together new strands of thinking about nature which suggest that humanity and nature have never been separate. The argument is developed through a critical discussion of the Romantic ideal of pure nature, unsullied by humanity and largely confined to fragile margins in need of protection and more recent discourses which identify nature with environment, and cast man in the role of a polluter and destroyer.	2002	Sage						ZZZ000000
9780803984943	George Kelly	Fay Fransella		George Kelly's personal construct theory, first published in 1955, is as radical today as it was then. Describing how each one of us goes about our daily life trying to make sense of the events around us, it maintains that we are in charge of what we do in the world, that we do not merely react to events.This book reveals that George Kelly was a man of enormous intellect, of many talents and of great complexity. Fay Fransella outlines how his views have influenced the theory and practice of psychotherapy, and illustrates how his training in physics and mathematics influenced his theory and led to the development of one of his methods of measurement - the repertory grid.The book also describes Kelly's philosophy of constructive alternativism, which suggests that we have created and can therefore recreate ourselves, and that what is true for the individual, rather than some external truth, is what matters. This philosophy can be seen as a precursor of the current emphasis on constructivism. Criticisms of Kelly's work and examples of work carried out within this framework since his death are also featured.	1995	Sage						ZZZ000000

9780803975903	Undisciplined theory	Gary Genosko		What is the value of interdisciplinary theory? Are there any boundaries left which social theory must recognize? This book shows that the vital questions in theory are being posed and followed at the interdisciplinary level. Our awareness of this is curtailed by the institutional organization of social theory which still tends to assume a canon and clear boundaries. Gary Genosko proposes that postmodernism has provided the main challenge to institutional myopia. Yet postmodernism is too often treated as an aberration or a blind alley. The challenge for social theorists today is to develop and practice `undisciplined theories' which constantly question the limits of the canon and expose the porous character of boundaries.  The book contains rigorous and original analyses of the writings of Baudrillard, Deleuze, Guattari, McLuhan, Freud and St Augustine. The author uses these materials to point the way to credible forms of undisciplined theory. Three tasks emerge as urgent issues for social theory: the need to think and feel ambivalence; to track the circulation of anomalies in theoretical texts; and to learn from the fascination with interpretative boundlessness.	1998	Sage Publications						ZZZ000000

9780803989108	Gender, symbolism and organizational cultures	Silvia Gherardi		The symbolic order of gender in organizations - how gender relations are culturally and discursively produced and reproduced, and how they might be 'done' differently, are explored in this book.Silvia Gherardi focuses on the relationship between gender, power and culture in organizations and on the need to come to grips with the pervasive, elusive and ambiguous nature of gender in work settings. She introduces two key metaphors. The first is of the sexual contract, which centres on the sexuality of organizations and 'static' gender difference. The second, of the alchemic wedding, highlights a plurality of cultural models of femaleness and of women/work relationships, and processes of dynamic difference, transformation and transcendence.Gherardi continues her examination of the construction of gender relations in the workplace through a series of rich and illuminating stories which also draw on various symbolic archetypes as powerful forms of cultural expression. The final section of the book looks at possibilities for change, developing in particular a concept of different forms of gender citizenship of organizations.	1995	Sage						ZZZ000000

9780803957916	Community organizing,building social capital as a development strategy	Ross J. Gittell&Avis Vidal		Community Organizing provides new insight into an important national challenge how to stimulate the formation of genuinely community-based organizations and effective citizen action in neighborhoods that have not spawned these efforts spontaneously. Since Robert Putnam's identification of the role of social capital in regional governance and economic development, there has been a virtual industry of interest and action created around the implications of his findings for the development of low-income communities. Yet, there remains a paucity of detailed empirical effort testing and refining his ideas. This book attempts to fill this gap. Community Organizing distills lessons from a national demonstration program that employed a novel approach to community organizing consensus organizing. Consensus organizing enhances social capital, building both stronger internal ties and capacity in low-income communities and fostering new relations (bridges) between residents of low-income communities and larger metropolitan area support communities.  Using evaluation research and detailed comparative study of community development activity in three diverse demonstration sites, Ross Gittell and Avis Vidal identify key elements of building social capital, which strongly affect community development: comprehension of community development, credibility of effort and participants, confidence, competence, and constructive critiques of efforts. Other elements are more relevant to program management and implementation and include communication among participants, congruence of program effort, management of inherent contradiction, and adjusting implementation to reflect local context.  This book describes the limits and promise of building social capital and will be of interest to community development students and professionals.	1998-06-10	Sage Publications						ZZZ000000

9780803976290	Metaphor and organizations	David Grant&Cliff Oswick		Metaphors are, according to Gareth Morgan 'a way of thinking and a way of seeing'. The use of metaphor underpins the expectations, behaviour and strategies governing all aspects of organizational life. Written by a team of internationally renowned scholars, this collection of critical essays analyzes the role of metaphor in the theory of organizations. The book extends existing debates concerning metaphor and the study of organizations, and also generates new concepts and theories in the field. The introduction shows how metaphors work and familiarizes the reader with key areas of debate concerning their use. Part One considers the role of metaphor in creating new theories of organization and in reinterpreting existing theories. Parts Two and Three go beyond the theoretical context, to examine the use of metaphor in our organizational experience. Part Two explores metaphor in organizational discourse and language, showing how the construction of different metaphors can provide powerful tools with which to manage organizations. Part Three investigates the relevance of metaphors in real organizational situations and how they influence attitudes and behaviour. Finally, Part Four offers an agenda for the function of metaphors in organizational research and suggests new directions that this research might take.	1996	Sage Publications						ZZZ000000

9780761908913	Doing ethnographic research,fieldwork settings	Scott Grills		There is nothing quite so exciting and daunting as taking your first steps into the field as an ethnographic researcher. This collection of essays features the contributions of a wide range of researchers who consider the key research problems in their given field site and how they were managed. The selections give a novice researcher a sense of the problems, uncertainties, and apprehensions that are part of the research act, as well as the benefit of the experiences that these researchers share in dealing with those issues. Editor Scott Grills presents a collection that takes the reader through the natural history of the research act from establishing oneself in the fieldwork setting to presentation and representation issues. Doing Ethnographic Research is ideally suited for use in a research methods class. As an "ethnography of ethnography," it provides a behind-the-scenes glimpse into fieldwork and simultaneously shows students how research done in substantive areas quite distant from their own can be powerfully relevant and revealing.	1998	Sage Publications						ZZZ000000
9780803970120	Constructing the self in a mediated world	Debra Grodin&Thomas R. Lindlof		In today's media-saturated world, identities are no longer built solely within the close-knit communities of family, neighborhood, school, and work. Today media are part of our world and therefore play an important role in the formulations of our identities or constructions of self. In a truly postmodern mode, Constructing the Self in a Mediated World not only brings together the usually segregated areas of interpersonal and mass communication but also incorporates works from scholars in sociology, psychology, and women's studies as well. Each essay examines our understanding of self in a different context of mediated culture within a specific framework of interpretive theories such as critical theory, social constructionist theory, and feminism. This volume provides insights into issues of self and identity in contemporary mediated culture. Designed for advanced students and experienced researchers in communication (both media and interpersonal), sociology, psychology, and women's studies. Constructing the Self in a Mediated World raises important questions and contributes greatly to its field.	1996-01-18	Sage Publications						ZZZ000000
9780761906858	Measuring community indicators,a systems approach to drug and alcohol problems	Paul J. Gruenewald		Drug and alcohol abuse monitoring and prevention has been pushed from the national to the local and community level. How do communities go about measuring the effectiveness of their drug and alcohol abuse programs? Aimed at providing communities and researchers with the needed analytic and practical tools for assessing their programs, Measuring Community Indicators begins with a presentation of how to collect community indicator data. The authors argue that while highly aggregated national data perform a number of important research and policy functions, such data are distinct from community indicator data and are of questionable use to local policy-oriented officials. They present a theoretical perspective--developed from community systems theory--as a basis for the practical strategies outlined in the book. They then cover such topics as different community indicators, the role of community surveys in filling the gaps in available "official statistics," and specific techniques for the primary collection of community indicator data (such as geographical mapping, systems of community data acquisition, and community contact maintenance). Researchers and evaluators of substance abuse and substance abuse programs will find this book provides them with the interdisciplinary information necessary to conceptualize and measure community drug and alcohol problems.	1997	Sage Publications						ZZZ000000
9780761936633	Divided we stand,India in a time of coalitions	Paranjoy Guha Thakurta&Shankar Raghuraman		This topical and absorbing book, written by two eminent journalists, explains why India has entered a new era of coalition politics. It analyses the consequences and implications of this relatively recent phenomenon. India has come a long way from the time since the Congress dominated the country's polity. The authors argue that the multi-party structure of government, or a coalition government, is neither temporary nor an aberration. Coalitions are here to stay, at least in the foreseeable future. The authors dismiss the view that India's polity is essentially bipolar, that is, led by either of the two largest political parties - the Congress or the Bharatiya Janata Party. They do not accede to the contention that other political parties have no option but to align themselves with either the Congress or the Bharatiya Janata Party. Continuing the analysis begun in their earlier work, India in a Time of Coalitions: Divided we Stand (Sage, 2004) both authors skilfully piece together the complex jigsaw of Indian politics. The authors point to the fragmentation of Indian polity with the rise of caste-based and regional parties and the formation of coalitions at the federal as well as provincial levels. This, they say, should not be perceived as a negative feature but as a positive influence on the working of the country's democratic structures. The authors take the view that coalition governments are in fact better equipped to deal with the tensions of India's deeply divided and highly hierarchical society. In comparison, governments dominated by single parties tend to both centralize and homogenize.  Among the issues the book analyzes are " The impact of the April-May 2004 general elections that saw the dramatic decline of the National Democratic Alliance led by the BJP and its replacement by a government formed by the United Progressive Alliance coalition led by the Congress with outside support from four left parties " A gradual revival in the fortunes of the Congress after the party had witnessed its traditional supporters - including the minorities and the disadvantaged groups - deserting it in large numbers  " The sudden rise and fall of the BJP from the time it was almost wiped out in 1984, the party's faction-ridden character and its inability to quickly come to terms with its electoral defeat in 2004 " The growing importance and the changing tactics of the left parties, their internal differences and mainstreaming and their influence on the country's economic policies " The crucial question of whether coalitions can provide stable governments and under what circumstances " The possibility of alternate political formations - led neither by the Congress nor the BJP - coming to power at the centre " The extent to which political coalitions have led to better governance, brought about a greater degree of federalism and reduced the incidence of corruption " The manner in which successive governments have handled the new politics of economic liberalization and globalization together with the crucial issue of growth with equity Challenging many commonly held views regarding India's political processes, this fascinating book will delight anyone interested in Indian politics at the beginning of the 21st century.	2007	SAGE Publications						ZZZ000000

This book provides an examination of the issue and offers some good advice about helping clients withdraw from drugs and cope with their realities drug-free' - Contemporary PsychologyThis practical guide is for practitioners working with clients taking prescribed drugs. Describing the uses and limitations of psychotropic drugs and their effect on the counselling process, the author shows how clients' underlying and often deep-seated problems cannot really be solved until they are drug-free and have recovered from their drug use.Providing a sound theoretical base and factual information backed up by case examples, Diane Hammersley lays down guidelines for assessment, drug withdrawal and the appropriate counselling approaches to consider while clients are still taking drugs or are withdrawing from drug use. She also explores more complex problems - such as overdosing, psychotic episodes and antisocial behaviour - and suggests when and how to counsel and when to refer on.	1995-04-27	Sage Publications						ZZZ000000

9780761905905	Studying aging and social change,conceptual and methodological issues	Melissa A. Hardy		What if the world population consisted of a single generation that lived forever? Or what if each successive generation came into being all at once and then perished before the next generation came into existence? How would the absence of many different generations sharing pieces of the same time-line alter how we think about the linked processes of aging and social change? In this book, editor Melissa Hardy presents a collection of strategies for conceptualizing and analyzing the connections between intra-vidual and societal change. Studying Aging and Social Change questions the boundaries between self and society and change and stability. The book includes classic treatments on generations and cohorts by Karl Mannheim and Norman Ryder and presents a new theoretical contribution that explores the meaning of aging as a social process. Each of the six new essays develops a central theoretical concept, linking that concept to issues of research design and analysis. By reexamining the assumptions that underlie our approaches to the study of change, this volume provides key insights into how we can understand fundamental social processes such as human development and socialization, the formation of public opinion and political identity, and the shaping of collective action and group behavior. This enlightening volume will be a valuable resource for academics and students in the fields of social work, gerontology, sociology, and family studies.	1997-08-04	Sage Publications						ZZZ000000

9780761954262	Cognitive science and folk psychology,the right frame of mind	W. F. G. Haselager		Folk psychology, our everyday talk of beliefs, desires, and mental events, has long been compared with the technical language of cognitive science. Does folk psychology provide a correct account of the mental causes of our behavior? Or must our everyday terms ultimately be replaced by a language developed from computational models and neurobiology? Such questions, which penetrate the heart of philosophy and psychology, are addressed in this broad-ranging and accessible book. Cognitive Science and Folk Psychology overviews the key literature in the field including the seminal work of Fodor and Churchland before exploring the classic frame problem to assess the future prospects of cognitive science. The scope of the frame problem touching on debates around connectionism, non-demonstrative reasoning, representationalism, and the language of thought, questions the very possibility of a truly artificial intelligence. Cognitive Science and Fold Psychology offers an invaluable survey of some of the most exciting debates in the field today. It will be essential reading for students and academics in cognitive science, cognitive psychology, artificial intelligence, and philosophy.	1997-08-18	Sage Publications						ZZZ000000

9780761901174	Generative fathering,beyond deficit perspectives	Alan J. Hawkins&David Curtis Dollahite		Much of contemporary scholarship on fathers comes from a deficit model, focusing on men's inadequacies as parents. This edited volume assembles a group of prominent scholars who go beyond a deficit model of fatherhood to what the editors call a generative fathering perspective. The generative fathering approach, inspired by the developmental theories of Erik Erikson and building on the pioneering research of John Snary, sees the work fathers do for their children in terms of caring for and contributing to the life of the next generation. The editors describe generative fathering, placing it in contrast to the role-inadequacy perspective of fatherhood. Contributors then elaborate on generative fathering in terms of gender, ethnicity, and historical perspectives and present research that helps us understand generative fathering in challenging life circumstances, such as special-needs children, teenage fathering, and divorce and remarriage. Applications for the generative fathering perspective are presented in terms of family life education, clinical work, and scholarly discourse. The editors conclude the volume with a chapter on ways to teach about generative fathering in college courses. Supported by both qualitative and quantitative research, this book goes beyond the frequent identification of fathers as primarily absent, abusive, deadbeat, deficient, or unnecessary, and helps us to understand fathers as men working to build caring bridges across generations.	1997	Sage Publications						ZZZ000000

9780803939837	Pediatric and adolescent AIDS,research findings from the social sciences	Scott W. Henggeler&Gary B. Melton&James R. Rodrigue		The response to children with AIDS is often misguided and irrational. Consequently, infected infants and children must suffer not only the deadly effects of the disease, but ostracism, fear, neglect and stretched medical resources as well. Responding to the high demand for information on pediatric and adolescent AIDS, this volume provides a concise, integrated, and up-to-date review of social science research, clinical work, and theory. Initial chapters provide a necessary understanding of the medical and epidemiological aspects of the disease. Subsequent chapters on AIDS knowledge and attitudes, adolescent sexual behavior, and adolescent intravenous drug use illustrate why adolescents may represent the next wave of the epidemic. Treatment and prevention approaches are discussed, and the many complex ethical and legal issues surrounding clinical and research aspects of pediatric and adolescent AIDS are delineated. Finally, research priorities for the early 1990s are suggested. Well written and researched, Pediatric and Adolescent AIDS is the first review of social science research that pertains specifically to pediatric AIDS. Graduate students, researchers, and professionals in the fields of psychiatry, medicine, nursing, social work, education, and law will find this a valuable resource. "The impact of AIDS and HIV on the adolescent and pediatric age groups is effectively presented in this well-written book. Differences in the clinical features of children with AIDS as compared to adults is documented, and attitudes, knowledge, and behavior of this age group are presented. . . .The book provides a wealth of information regarding the disease and a lengthy and valuable reference list. The data presented are alarming, but informative and interesting. A valuable asset to any library, public or personal." --Choice "The book has much to recommend it. The strengths and weaknesses of attitutde and knowledge survey methods among adolescents are well presented. American legal casework regarding the schooling of HIV infected children adds a disturbing and important dimension to the discussion." --Nursing Times "Scott Henggeler, Gary Melton, and James Rodrigue have drawn upon their expetise in behavior problems of adolescence, ethics and law, and prevention to create a thorough review of the multidisciplinary literature on pediatric and adolescent HIV infection which has developed over the past decade. The chapters on adolescent sexual behavior and injecting drug use are particularly well written and insightful. . . . Their book provides a framework for research in these underserved and understudied populations, and highlights the methodological shortcomings of the poorly designed instruments and studies which have characterized early literature. . . . It is unusual to find a book that so adequately addresses the needs of adolescents for HIV and AIDS prevention. . . . Their recommendations for increasing our understanding of adolescent sexuality and injecting drug abuse are of great importance and should not be overlooked." --Journal of Pediatric Psychology "The tone of the book is uniformly sensitive and compassionate. It is written in such a clear way as to make easy reading. . . . For the reader who seeks greater depth of information the text is referenced richly from the current research literature. . . . This book is a fine introduction to the issues of pediatric and adolescent AIDS and should prove a valuable and challenging read for all concerned with child welfare services, student and practitioner alike." --Health and Social Care	1992	Sage Publications						ZZZ000000

Taking as its starting point that individuals not only shape the world but are shaped by it, this book argues that the behaviours of those who offend and victimize others cannot be understood in isolation from the society of which they are a part.Instead of setting out to identify factors that cause offending, constitutive criminology examines the co-production of crime by human subjects and by the social and organizational structures that humans develop. The implications are, first, that crime must be deconstructed as a recurrent discursive process and, secondly, that conscious attempts must be made at reconstruction with a view to preventing recurrence. In constrast with the sceptical versions of postmodernism that pervade the social sciences and humanities Stuart Henry and Dragan Milovanovic focus on reconstruction and redirection. Drawing together disparate perspectives,they analyze a number of key themes, including: human nature and behaviour; society and social order; the role of the law; the definitions of crime; crime causation; and justice policy and practice.	1996	Sage Publications						ZZZ000000

9780803951167	Interpersonal communication in older adulthood,interdisciplinary theory and research	Mary Lee Hummert&John M. Wiemann&Jon F. Nussbaum		"This book is particularly relevant now as the baby-boomer generation is aging and a greater proportion of the world's population is growing older. Interpersonal communication is clearly the most critical process for promoting social integration and adaptation of older adults within society. Yet understanding of the complex dynamics of interpersonal communication with the elderly is severely limited and the aged are often stigmatized, stereotyped, and isolated. This book will help clarify the role of communication in effective social integration and adaptation of the aged by providing comprehensive and in-depth analyses of relevant research and theory. The book integrates information on the most important issues and contexts influencing interpersonal communication and aging and the individual chapters are written by an excellent group of authors who have demonstrated expertise on their topics. The book is well organized, clearly written, and comprehensive. The major topics are logically organized and compelling. I highly recommend this book!" --Gary L. Kreps, Northern Illinois University "Aging obviously occurs at many levels, with biological, psychological, and social systems showing multidirectional and interdependent changes. What is less obvious is how these factors affect communication in later life. This volume represents a strong contribution toward solving this problem by bringing together a group of prominent scholars with diverse perspectives on language, communication, and aging." --Elizabeth A. I. Stine, University of New Hampshire "The Hummert, Wiemann, and Nussbaum book brings together a strong theoretical base with the presentation of new data. The chapters go well beyond the typical literature reviews usually found in edited volumes. The contributors provide sophisticated presentations of a variety of socially significant and unique topics, including the communicative impact of physical and cognitive changes sometimes associated with aging, patronization, verbosity, frailty, conversational skills, proper names, and the presentation of self. Some of the chapters are strongly quantitative while others are more interpretive. After building a strong rationale for the volume, the editors go on to put together a series of well-written chapters that provide a much needed emphasis on the social construction of relationships through communication. The book should prompt much new research and advance our understanding of interpersonal communication and the aging process significantly." --Teresa Thompson, University of Dayton "The rich diversity of theoretical and methodological perspectives highlighted within the various chapters is an impressive feature of this edited collection. These essays add conceptual breadth and depth to our understanding of interpersonal communication and the process of aging." --Mary Anne Fitzpatrick, Department of Communication Arts, University of Wisconsin "This book is a valuable addition to the gerontological literature. Written from the perspective of the communication researcher, it brings together existing literature and offers new insights to gerontologists working in many social science disciplines. I recommend Interpersonal Communication in Older Adulthood as a resource to any scholars interested in older adults." --Victor G. Cicirelli, Professor of Developmental and Aging Psychology, Purdue University "This book is very timely. Communication is offering a new wave of aging research, and interpersonal processes in communication are where our experiences and our personal theories of aging are grounded. This book brings together many of the researchers who are breaking new ground in communication and aging. It offers a valuable overview of where we have gone in aging theory communicatively, and where we need to go. Interpersonal Communication in Older Adulthood demonstrates the rich diversity of methods and traditions of communication research that are beginning to illuminate gerontology." --Nikolas Coupland, University of Wales, Cardiff By highlighting the commonalities across a range of disciplines, Interpersonal Communication in Older Adulthood provides a unique and broad-based perspective on communication and aging. This integrative approach brings together the best of the current research and theory from communication, cognitive psychology, psycholinguistics, and medical sociology. The underlying framework of the book centers around three topics--cognition, language, and relationships--exploring the individual areas as well as the ways they intersect. In addition, this volume brings to light the implications of the elderly population's individual differences as they affect communication, and illustrates the positive as well as the negative effects of the aging process on language production, relational satisfaction, and other communication-related variables. This major reference source, Interpersonal Communication in Older Adulthood, is essential reading for anyone concerned with the issues of aging and communication.	1994	Sage Publications						ZZZ000000

The last section addresses specifically the processes of acting as a facilitator to collaborative groups.

Imbroscio		Almost two decades of research in U.S. city politics has produced a compelling empirical account of the nature of urban governance revolving around the alliance of business interests and local public officials. In Reconstructing City Politics, author David L. Imbroscio urges that urban political economy must now move forward beyond the question of "what is?" to a consideration of "what might be?" He systematically poses the possibilities for reconstructing the nature of contemporary city politics, while integrating a wealth of innovative urban analysis. To bring about this reconstruction, Imbroscio explores three comprehensive alternative urban economic development strategies--entrepreneurial mercantilism, community based economic development, and municipal enterprise. He considers whether these three strategies are likely to be effective for bringing about urban economic vitality and whether it is feasible for cities to pursue these efforts in the current political economic context. By addressing these questions, Imbroscio is able to reach conclusions about the possibilities for a successful and sustainable reconstruction of U.S. city politics. This important volume will be vital for professionals and and researchers in urban planning, urban studies, urban and regional economics, as well as urban politics.	1997	Sage Publications						ZZZ000000

For example, by examining contradictory pairs of concepts like structure/agency, local/global, continuity/change, students are introduced to alternative explanations for aspects of human conduct over a whole series of issues.	1998-08-24	Sage						ZZZ000000

Central to the book is an examination of this orthodoxy's appeal to the concept of social justice. Bill Jordan demonstrates how values derived from the family and voluntary associations are in danger of running counter to the more fundamental principles of liberal democracy and the requirements of transnational economic exchange. He links the new politics of welfare to liberal and communitarian theories of citizenship and social justice, and assesses the broader prospects for European social policy in	1998	Sage						ZZZ000000
9780761998402	Industrial relations,towards a theory of negotiated connectedness	Jerome Joseph		This book examines industrial relations in a liberalizing, deregulated and global environment through the prism of connectedness. The author reinterprets industrial relations and offers connectedness as an alternative definition to the more conventional understanding of industrial relations. By doing so he makes us realize that connectedness has always been a part of industrial relations though buried and forgotten under the issues of labour market structures, trade unions, labour law and employment trends. This futuristic book calls for radically rethinking industrial relations from a perspective which is independent of any single stakeholder worldview.	2004-02-01	Response Books, a division of Sage Publications						ZZZ000000

This book draws on testimonies from both groups concerning their experiences at work and the impact these have on their lives generally to explain such paradoxes.	2001-10-30	Vistaar Publ.

Kenworthy argues that the key to economic success lies in combining competition with cooperation. Among advanced industrialized nations, the countries achieving the best economic performance results over the past three decades have been the most committed to combining competition and cooperation. Those faring worst rely predominantly on atomistic, individualistic competition. In the end, the comparative record strongly supports a focus on cooperation-inducing institutions.	1995	SAGE Publications						ZZZ000000

However, despite the seriousness of this ethnic challenge, there exists no detailed study of these movements, Politics of Identity fills this vacuum.  Ethnic nationalism, the author argues, is a political issue and is essentially a struggle for power between dominant and non-dominant groups. Highlighting the role the state plays in the lives of individuals, the book:  - studies both the pre-colonial and colonial state system in India and the changes it effected until India's independence and the creation of Pakistan;  - assesses the state in Pakistan and explains its role in giving rise to ethnic discontent;  - studies four ethnic movements - Pukhtun, Baloch, Sindhi and Mohajir - demonstrating how their proximity to or distance from state power have influenced their politics.	2005	Sage Publications						ZZZ000000
9780761935919	States of the Indian Economy,Towards a Larger Constituency for Second Generation Economic Reforms	Amir Ullah Khan&Harsh Vivek		The phenomenal rise of India in the global economy has been attributed to a whole host of factors, the major ones being the focus on economic reforms and the demographic dividend that India currently enjoys due to its demographic transition. The large pool of human capital - a young, talented and well-educated workforce - is one of the major drivers of economic growth in the country. Rapid strides in knowledge-based industries, especially information technology, biotechnology and pharmaceuticals; rejuvenation of the manufacturing sector, revolution in the agriculture sector; and, resurgence in exports have made India one of the fastest growing economies in the world. A market-oriented approach to development, opening up of the economy and the growing economies of scale and scope for Indian enterprises, access to 'modern' technology - especially information technology - and growth in entrepreneurship have made India a sought-after destination for foreign investment.  The authors argue that this situation is a result of the implementation of a set of first generation economic reforms, initiated primarily by the Central government but the responsibilities of which are now on the State governments. To carry the second generation of reforms forward in a meaningful manner, action has now has shifted to the states.  With this background, this book primarily examines the following:  - The state of the Indian economy after one and a half decades of liberalisation and its role in the fast changing global economy - The economic performance of various Indian states during this period - Identifies sectors that have done well and those that need substantial improvement in terms of adoption and implementation of reform measures.	2007-11-06	SAGE Publications						ZZZ000000
9780761955474	Managing complex networks,strategies for the public sector	Walter Julius Michael Kickert&Erik-Hans Klijn&Johannes Franciscus Maria Koppenjan		This innovative volume develops a network management approach to governance and public management, and shows how governments can manage policy networks to enhance policy performance and public service delivery. It is increasingly apparent that neither bureaucracy nor markets provide ultimate solutions for governance in modern societies. Public policy is made and implemented in networks of independent public and private actors. Managing Complex Networks argues that the management of such networks is an important part of a practical approach to public management. Although the concept of policy networks is now well established in the field, most research has contented itself with description and analysis of their contribution to policy failure. This book goes further. It accepts policy networks as a fundamental characteristic of modern societies and illustrates the various strategies for intervention. The book ends with presenting a toolkit for the management of these networks. The scholars contributing to this book have come to the forefront of research in the field of policy networks and their management. What they have to say about this topic is vital reading for academics and advanced level students in management, organization studies, public administration, political science and policy studies, as well as for public service professionals.	1997	Sage						ZZZ000000

9780803986855	Leaving abusive partners,from the scars of survival to the wisdom for change	Catherine Kirkwood		This moving book reshapes our understanding of the nature of woman abuse and makes a major contribution to a key issue for feminist campaigning and theory. The past 25 years of research on 'battered' women has focused on the psychological, sociological and political conditions which contribute to violence, and on women's reasons for staying with violent and abusive partners. The author goes beyond the discourse of 'victims' and 'survivors' to offer new insights into the very specific and multifaceted nature of the abuses women experience - emotional as well as physical.Drawing on firsthand accounts, Kirkwood sheds new light both on the dynamics of abuse which afford abusers control over women and the resources and knowledge women draw upon to re-empower themselves. Examining first the nature of abuse and then the issues confronted by a woman after she has left an abusive relationship, Kirkwood finds that women's experiences of society after leaving abusive partners are highly interrelated. She develops the concept of a 'web' to explain how the different elements of abuse connect to make up the experiences of abused women.	1993-10-11	SAGE						ZZZ000000

9780761932628	Crafting peace in Kashmir,through a realist lens	Verghese Koithara		Presenting a completely new perspective on the Kashmir conflict, this book argues that resolving the situation can be brought about through a `peace strategy' rather than a `war strategy'.   Through an analysis of the conflicts in Northern Ireland, Sri Lanka and Palestine, the author draws parallels between the India-Pakistan conflict. He also presents reasons why a durable peace - based on the Line of Control becoming the settled border and the two parts of Jammu and Kashmir being given parallel and substantial autonomy - can be achieved in today's conditions.  The book concludes that peace between India and Pakistan is possible based on political realism and that strategic solutions that safeguard the interests of both countries are available.	2004	SAGE						ZZZ000000

Thinking about her book has focused my interest in the cultural dimensions of clinical work, and in the role of kinship, taboo and ritual, in the inter and intraprofessional conflicts which permeate our profession' - British Journal of PsychotherapyThis groundbreaking book demonstrates the importance of cross-cultural communication to psychotherapy, psychoanalysis and counselling. It gives an introduction to anthropological issues which are relevant to cross-cultural work, examining practical as well as conceptual aspects of culture. The book provides an overview and gives examples on which clinicians may draw to enhance their understanding of their clients, and which will help anthropologists to understand and interpret the personal circumstances of their informants.Complex theories from ethnography and anthropology are explained and made accessible, while kinship, attachment and emotion, ritual and taboo are explored, illuminating how the cultural content of patterns of interaction and behaviour are expressed in ideas, feelings, attitudes and inclinations. Finally, it is argued that cross-cultural communication must originate in the therapist or anthropologist taking responsibility for becoming aware of his or her own assumptions as a starting point for cross-cultural work.	1998	Sage Publications						ZZZ000000

9781853964282	Learners and pedagogy	Jenny Leach&Bob Moon		'This presents a useful model for conceptualizing pedagogy as professional knowledge, well supported by selected readings' - Dr A Loveless, University of Brighton'This book makes a plea for recreating thinking about knowledge, learning and pedagogy in the context of challenges posed by change - both cultural and technological. Bruner emphasizes that in coming to know, our own knowledge needs to be worked on and transformed, assisted by the toolhouse that is culture. This collection stands as a rich resource from which to exercise our thoughts and reflect on our activities as educators' - British Educational Research JournalThis textbook looks at the relationship between views of learning, learners, knowledge and pedagogy. Worldwide, education is being subjected to a succession of policy initiatives and political interventions. Questions of what should be taught, and how, are subjects of constant debate, seldom based on research findings or theoretical principles. The articles in this volume have been chosen to show how theories can provide frameworks for analysing pedagogy and to create a dialogue about new possibilities for advancing practice.Learners and Pedagogy is a Course Reader for The Open University course E836 Learning Curriculum and Assessment.	1999	Paul Chapman						ZZZ000000
9780761904786	Sex and sexuality,risk and relationships in the age of AIDS	Dana Lear		Following her study of a group of college students - a community likely to experiment sexually - Dana Lear has written a timely and persuasive book which considers how sexual communication does and does not occur among young adults, how gender and sexual orientation influence the ability to negotiate safer sex, and what barriers to open communication still exist.  Lear presents a number of provocative and telling excerpts from the interviews which were a part of her study. These accounts portray the attitudes toward risk, casual relationships, trust and the negotiation of sexuality that are at issue today. Finally, Lear considers her findings in terms of normative influences as well as possible policy implications.	1997	Sage Publications						ZZZ000000

The author argues that media effects are only half of the equation; the mass media cannot be seen as the exclusive source of political information. In a model of `total information flow', the media must share the political information environment with interpersonal communication. This volume bridges the gap between media and interpersonal communication and their combined effect on political attitudes and cognition.	1994	Sage Publications						ZZZ000000

9780803938618	Social theory and modernity,critique, dissent, and revolution	Timothy W. Luke		Social Theory and Modernity combines the analytical techniques of political theory and comparative politics as a method for conducting innovative inquiry and research in political science. The focus of political theory, for example, results in new issues for historical and cross-national comparative analysis--whereas comparative analysis provides new parameters for analyzing the ideology of social institutions. In presenting this method, Luke elaborates upon Rousseau's discursive style and critical methods, Marx's historical materialism, Gramsci's theoretical tactics, Marcuse's instrumental rationality, Cabral's theories of critique and revolution, Weber's interpretive method, and Foucault's system of political and social analysis. It concludes by offering an incisive analysis of the moral and ideological influence of behavior and the link between ideology and political economy, especially in modern society. Social Theory and Modernity is essential reading for professionals and students in the fields of political theory, history, comparative politics, sociology, anthropology, social philosophy, and cultural studies. "Luke's book is a tour de force. He writes critical theory in the best sense, applying the ideas of the Frankfurt School, Gramsci, and postmodernism to real social and political issues today. Social Theory and Modernity avoids arid exegesis in favor of engaged and lucid analysis of the global problematics of late capitalism. Not content simply to rehearse the masters of critical theory, Luke refreshes and extends their ideas by developing his own important theoretical voice. Luke is witty and pulls no punches. This accessible book will appeal to readers in a wide range of social-science disciplines, notably including political science and sociology. This book reinforces Luke's reputation as one of the two or three leading critical theorists working today." --Ben Agger, SUNY, University at Buffalo "This collection of essays provides a rich reading for it collates a lot of innovative ideas in the present day Marxist theory." --Financial Express	1990	Sage Publications						ZZZ000000

The book's strengths, namely its scholarly approach and critical thinking, well serve its audience of academics and students." --Doody's Health Sciences Book Review Journal "Deborah Lupton's complex treatise seeks to demonstrate that public health viewpoints and practices are value laden, political and socially subjective, and change over time and location. [This volume] is a good history of public health developments, primarily in Australia and England, and is a continuation of debate among health education professionals over the status of any and all health education 'truths.'. . . Lupton succeeds in her stated goal to 'problematize the taken-for-granted nature of health promotion discourses.'" --Choice In a scintillating reappraisal of public health and health promotion in contemporary societies, author Deborah Lupton shows that health cannot be understood simply as the presence or absence of disease but represents a moral imperative that is embedded in social and cultural norms and expressed in public policies. The Imperative of Health explores the areas of public health and health promotion using contemporary sociocultural and political theory and builds on Foucault's writings on subjectivity, embodiment, and power relations. Lupton analyzes the implications of the new social theories for the study of health promotion and health communication, combining sociological, anthropological, historical, and cultural studies approaches to analyze the subjective nature of public health practices, and exploring their underlying meanings and assumptions. Academics in public health, mass communication, medical sociology, and cultural studies will find this exploration concise, readable, and enlightening.	1995	Sage Publications						ZZZ000000

Also examined are cases where Britain provides the exclusive focus for discussion either about class itself, or about how sociologists might most useful	1997	SAGE Publications						ZZZ000000

Progress in this new understanding of fathers is highlighted in Fatherhood, a volume of empirical and theoretical research on fathers in families. The research pieces, written by such well-known scholars as Furstenberg, Seltzer, and Greif, examine differences in culture, class, nationality, and custodial status. The chapters focus on legal, economic, and policy questions, as well as on the interaction between fathers and children within the family. Some of the topics explored are fathers' involvement in child care, fathering in the inner city, and single fathers who have custody of their children. Fatherhood is the most current assessment of our research base on fatherhood available for professional, scholarly, and classroom use and is important reading for those interested in men's studies, family studies, gender studies, sociology, psychology, and social work.	1995	Sage Publications						ZZZ000000

9780803984165	Economy and society,overviews in economic sociology	Alberto Martinelli&Neil J. Smelser		This is the first overview of the interface between economics and sociology. Normally considered quite separately, the volume reconciles the disciplines. Amongst the many questions considered are: the formal relationship between the two disciplines; the distinctive ranges of empirical data which each discipline calls into question; how the substantive findings of one discipline can modify the assumptions of the other.The book explores the historical development of economic theories of society and the concept of the rational economic actor and contextualizes debates on rationality. The contribution of economic sociology is demonstrated through critical assessments of key areas of the literature such as the state\market division in capitalist and socialist economies, the informal economy and the relation of states and economies to the international arena. As a major overview of the dialogue between economists and sociologists, this book will be of interst to a broad range of lecturers and students in the social sciences. Economy and Society is being published simultaneously as Volume 38, issues 2 - 3 of Current Sociology.	1990	Sage Publications						ZZZ000000

The study covers two decades that have been characterized by extensive technological innovation, sectoral shifts in international trade and far-reaching social transformation.	1991	Sage						ZZZ000000

I enjoyed reading it and gained some new insights and ideas. The explanations are clear and detailed and the examples are very helpful. The Ethics of Information Management is unique with its total focus on information and privacy. This is a critical area and this book makes a fine contribution." --Ernest A. Kallman, Research Fellow, Center for Business Ethics, Bentley College "At this stage in the information age, at this point in our understanding of issues and our understanding of the relation between ethics and information, any book that raises our awareness and sense of responsibility is worth publishing. Ethics of Information Management definitely does that." --Martha L. Hale, School of Library and Information Management, Emporia State University "This book breaks new ground in innovatively introducing the issues involved in information ethics to a business school curriculum. Cases are used throughout to identify the issues with numerous references back to each case to identify ways of reasoning, situations in which policies and procedures can help, and situations in which laws and professional codes are useful or not. There are many nuggets of information and ways of looking at situations that will assist readers in identifying the issues and stakeholders, assessing alternatives and their ramifications, and making informed, ethical decisions throughout their careers." --Sue Conger, Management Information Sciences, Southern Methodist University The authors to the second volume in the Sage Series in Business Ethics provide ways of thinking about information and the new responsibilities engendered by its acquisition, processing, storing, dissemination, and use. The Ethics of Information Management provides a set of concepts, methods, arguments, and illustrations designed to sharpen the reader's ethical focus. Organized into three sections, the first part of the book provides motivation and conceptual background for the volume as a whole. Part II focuses on fundamental concepts about ethics, including a description of the process of ethical thinking and a range of theories and principles that can be used in ethical situations. In the final chapters, the concepts of information, and the need for ethics and ethical thinking, are applied to the various levels of the social system to which they pertain: individual and professional, organizational and societal, or systemic. Intended primarily for those who are, or will soon become, information professionals, The Ethics of Information will also be of interest to others concerned about what those who handle information do and how it affects them.	1995-08-03	Sage Publications						ZZZ000000

9780803946804	Analytical Marxism	Thomas F. Mayer		Analytical Marxism blends the tenets of Marxist theory with many of the more traditional methods of social science. In this brief introduction to the major ideas and scholars in the Analytical Marxist school, Thomas F. Mayer assesses the achievements, strengths, and criticisms of their work. Focusing on the work of Elster, Roemer, Wright, and others, Mayer examines their writing on class, the state, exploitation, and revolution. Sections addressing communism and socialism define these terms in historical and current contexts, enabling the author to establish the patterns from which political predictions may be drawn. The book also explores the challenge to Marxist thought brought about by contemporary developments in Eastern Europe and suggests how the future of Marxism is shaped by these events. "Designed to help undergraduates understand the complex literature on the topic, this volume is written in an accessible style, and includes a glossary and annotated reading list. The language is exceptionally clear and free of mathematical equations. Thomas F. Mayer demonstrates in fact how needless equations so often are. Thomas F. Mayer's Analytical Marxism is a theoretical statement in its own right. As such, it is far more compelling than the edited volume with the same title that came out in 1986. What makes Mayer's book superior is that it has abandoned or muted many of the philosophically objectionable positions associated with its predecessor." -Contemporary Sociology "Thomas F. Mayer's book admirably demonstrates the robust and provacative results wrought by Cohen, ELster, Przeworski, Roemer, and Wright with their chosen tools. The liveliness and intensity of the debates provoked by these theorists' assertions suggests that the Marxian analytical tradition has a robust future." --Science and Society	1994	Sage Publications						ZZZ000000

9780803946040	High school underachievers	Robert B. McCall&Cynthia Evahn&Lynn Kratzer		For years, educators, counselors, and parents have debated whether underachievers can outgrow this behavior and perform up to their abilities as adults. What happens educationally, occupationally, and maritally to underachievers after they leave high school? In the largest sample of underachievers and the first long-term (13-year) study ever conducted, the authors explore whether underachievers "catch up" after high school to the level of their abilities, the traits of those who do, and the traits of those who don't. Through an analysis of the 13-year longitudinal study, they compare underachievers with students who receive the same grades and students who have tested at the same ability level but who have performed better in school. Covering such issues as personality variables, learning strategies, self-esteem, classroom structure, the educational system, and parental styles, the authors sift through the data to discover what factors are associated with underachievement and what techniques have worked to help these students improve their performance. USE FOR NEXT MAILING (11/94): "Good, substantive research on underachievement has been lacking in the field of gifted education for some time. McCall's book fills a needed void in the literature. . . . University libraries and resource centers for gifted education will want to add this book to their inventories. High School Underachievers is a timely addition on the most current information about underachievement." --Roeper Review "McCall has taken an unusually thorny and controversial area (controversial in the sense that historically there has been little agreement among workers in the area as to even the definition of the phenomena) and quite clearly defined a series of issues of interest to him. He has then applied a methodology to address those issues. . . . It seems to me that it is a good piece of work." --Mark Appelbaum, Vanderbilt University "This brief volume contains good data about a problem, underachievement, that represents a longtime concern of parents and educators. The authors discuss theories, but the only hypothesis tested was that underachievers might form a meaningful syndrome. They had an opportunity to analyze data--including the outcomes 13 years after high school graduation--on a sample of substantial size, and they obtained more relevant and dependable information about the supposed phenomenon than has heretofore been available. More psychological research should have this outcome and this beginning." --Contemporary Psychology	1992	Sage Publications						ZZZ000000

A good reference book for counsellors and students.... The authors' students, and clients, must be very happy that he has the interest and the capacity to tune in to others in such a fresh manner' - Counselling, The Journal of the British Association for CounsellingThe core of psychotherapy can be seen as a process in which the client comes to tell, and then re-author, an individual life-story or personal narrative. The author of this book argues that all therapies are, therefore, narrative therapies, and that the counselling experience can be understood in terms of telling and retelling stories. If the story is not heard, then the therapist and the client are deprived of the most effective and mutually involving mode of discourse open to them.Taking a narrative approach also requires thinking about the nature of truth, the concept of the person, the relationship between therapist and client, and the knowledge base of psychotherapy. John McLeod examines the role and significance of stories in psychotherapy from within a broad-based cultural and theoretical framework.	1997	Sage						ZZZ000000

9780803984295	Citizenship and the European Community	Elizabeth M. Meehan		As the European community develops a program of social policies at the transnational level, is a new kind of citizenship emerging? If so, how does European citizenship differ from citizenship at the national level, and how does it affect national citizenship rights? In this timely contribution to the debates on citizenship, Elizabeth Meehan provides an incisive analysis of the meaning of citizenship, and the links between civil, political, and social citizenship. She provides a clear account of the development of social rights within the European Community in three key areas: social security and assistance, participation by workers in undertakings in which they are employed, and the equal treatment of men and women. The author critically assesses the extent to which inequalities of class, gender, and ethnicity are successfully addressed by community social policies. Citizenship and the European Community will appeal to a wide readership across the social sciences, and will be of particular interest to academics and students of political studies, social policy, social and political theory, social inequalities and European studies. "This important little book provides the first overview in English of the practices of the European Community with respect to citizenship. It documents in detail the emergence of a solid tissue of new economic and social rights for workers throughout the Union. Elizabeth Meehan pays particular attention to the EC's actions in the area of equal protection, which have resulted in recalcitrant member states being pressed and prodded to move in the direction of gender equality. Meehan is careful to trace and document the roots of such new rights, which lie not only in the Treaty of Rome but also in the decisions of the European Court and directives of the Commission. In this analysis she clearly demonstrates the breadth of the commitment to extending citizenship rights within the institutions of the community." --Economic & Industrial Democracy	1993	Sage Publications						ZZZ000000

9780761901136	Cognition within and between organizations	James R. Meindl&Charles Stubbart&Joseph Francis Allen Porac		Published in cooperation with the Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences and its journal Organization Science One of the hottest topics in Organizational Science during the past several years has been how organizational members conceptualize and make sense of their organizational worlds. The growing interest in cognition, both within and between organizations, has coincided not accidentally, with the increasing legitimacy of a constructionist point of view among organizational scholars. Cognition Within and Between Organizations brings together the scholars whose work has fueled these theoretical developments. The topical focus of the chapters covers broad ground, from cognitive coordination on the bridge of a Navy ship to cultural belief systems in the California wine industry.

9780803977228	Re-forming the body,religion, community and modernity	Philip A. Mellor&Chris Shilling		Through an analysis of successive reformations of the body, this innovative and penetrating book constructs a fascinating and wide-ranging account of how the creation and evolution of different patterns of human community are intimately related to the somatic experience of the sacred. The book places the relationship between embodiment and the sacred at the crux of social theory and casts a fresh light on the emergence and transformation of modernity. It critically examines the thesis that the rational projects of modern embodiment have died and gone to cyberspace and suggests that we are witnessing the rise of a virulent, effervescent form of the sacred that is changing how people see and keep in touch with the world around them. Grounded in classical and contemporary theory, Re-Forming the Body makes a seminal contribution to understanding the relationship between the sacred and profane: the world of religious and moral sentiment and the world of the body. It will be essential reading for graduates, postgraduates, and advanced undergraduates in sociology and social theory, the body, religious studies, cultural studies, and related areas.	1997	SAGE						ZZZ000000

What ethical and legal issues do practitioners face in nursing homes? And how have reforms under the newly implemented 1987 OBRA legislature affected practice in nursing homes? With the rapid growth of nursing homes in the 1980s, questions such as these are now being raised by policymakers, administrators, practitioners, and others working in nursing homes. In this highly instructive volume, the authors examine these vital questions and explore such relevant issues as working with nursing home residents and their families, managing selected special populations, working with other members of the nursing home staff, legal and ethical issues, and the organizational and policy contexts that shape practice. In addition, the authors include structured learning tasks that can be used to guide the development of practice skills in supervised nursing home practicums and field settings. Professionals from a variety of fields including social work, nursing, geriatric mental health, medicine, and nursing home administration will find this book to be an invaluable resource in their own day to day work. "This book presents a useful and thorough introduction to the subject of case practice with older persons in nursing homes. While of interest to anyone who desires to work with older persons in nursing homes, this book will be particularly useful to students and professors in social work and gerontology courses. . . . Instructors will find that the chapters lend themselves effectively to course organization, and they will appreciate the model fieldwork assignments that are presented in the appendix." --Clinical Gerontologist "This book provides a detailed and practical introduction to the subject of geriatric case practice in nursing homes. To the authors' credit, the content reflects a sound psychosocial theoretical base consistent with social service and social work practice. Students, beginning case practitioners, and instructors will find this book to be a useful guide to geriatric case practice in nursing homes." --Clinical Gerontologist "Generally, the private nursing-home sector is poorly served with high quality literature specifically relating to this field; so, it is pleasing to find a book such as Geriatric Case Practice in Nursing Homes which is extremely well-written and fully referenced. . . . I definitely recommend [this book] to health-care staff from any profession who have contact with elderly people, particularly nursing and rest-home staff, hospital, community- and day-centre staff, and nursing-home inspectors." --Nursing Standard "Very useful as a textbook in schools of social work. . . . The text would be valuable to any professional neophyte in the nursing home industry who needs an overview of the field, its development and the policies that are meant to effect change in quality of care.

9780803991064	Designing messages for development communication,an audience participation-based approach	Bella Mody		Accessible and practical, Designing Messages for Development Communication takes the reader step by step through the process of designing audience-responsive messages in the Third World. Bella Mody takes the media producer through an audience research-based methodology to bridge the cultural and informational distance between senders and receivers. A discussion of the origins and nature of media use in national development over the last 30 years forms the introductory background against which the author reviews the current research on media effects. Mody presents audience research as a systematic device for the involvement of message receivers in decisions concerning message design, that is, what the message needs to say and how. This volume instructs development and communication planners, as well as media workers, first to listen to the audience so as to determine which information the audience needs and in what form they can process it most effectively and, then, to pretest messages before they are produced in their final form. A valuable tool for the media producer's problem of the "invisible audience" in mass communication, this volume is essential reading not only for students and teachers of development communication, but for media users and media producers who produce messages to support development. "The book will be of great help to those who work in the field on the facilitating level, training people to be future trainers in the field of development supporting communication." --Massacommunicatie "In this very welcome book . . . the author has done a very good job of turning development (support) communication 'common sense' into 'practical academic sense.' She has shown in a practical way that it is not enough only to propound high-sounding academic theories about common sense-based participatory development communication and then fail to show how they work in real life, as many of us have done and continue to do. The author has married theory to practice by showing media practitioners how it can/has been done." --Media Development	1991	Sage Publications						ZZZ000000

Pedagogy affects the way hundreds of thousands of learners of different ages and stages are taught. Yet, until recently, it has been a neglected topic. Instead of having access to systematic evidence about its impact, innovative teachers have been guided only by ideological positions, folk wisdom and fashionable enthusiasms for particular approaches.	1999	Chapman						ZZZ000000

Why do we still read him as a guide to contemporary social and cultural life?Foucault's work presents a provocative challenge to orthodox, habitual forms of belief and practice.

9788178296012	Cultivating Development : An Ethnography Of Aid Policy And Practice	Mosse		Based on a detailed account of an actual development project, this book addresses an important question: Is development practice actually driven by policy?Development agencies and researchers are preoccupied with policy; with exerting influence over policy; linking research to policy, and with implementing policy around the world. In this book, David Mosse argues that rather than being driven by policy, development practice is actually shaped by the exigencies of organisations and the need to maintain relationships. At the same time, however, development actors work hard at maintaining the fiction of representing authorised policy in their actions.This book (which can be characterised as being a social investigation) asks pertinent questions about international aid, in particular of British aid for rural development. It does so by examining in depth the experience of a development project in western India over a period of more than ten years and as it falls under different policy regimes. Mosse analyses development processes in the light of the broad experience of the project workers (which included himself), even if it means destabilising policy representations. The book is a compelling re-examination of the politics and ethics of engaging with development and a rare self-critical reflection practice.	2010	Sage Publications India Pvt Ltd						ZZZ000000

9781853962394	High-technology new firms,variable barriers to growth	Raymond P. Oakey		There has been a tendency for public and private industrial support agencies to adopt a common approach to providing aid to new high-technology firms, both at the time of start-up, and during the early years of the business.  This systematic analysis confirms that such a crude approach to high-technology new firm funding is inappropriate, since the potential for rapid early growth varies sharply between the three high-technology sectors of biotechnology, software and electronics, which were examined. A close investigation of the sectoral variations in the formation and early growth characteristics of new firms in these sectors provide valuable insights on both policy and theory. In particular, it is noted that the formation skills of the founder (or founders) have a strongly determining influence on the scope for choice of the founding technological base of the firm. In turn, exploitation of the initiating technology may involve substantial expenditure prior to any return on such investment. Indeed, seen in this light, many high-technology growth sectors appear to have been defined by high levels of expenditure rather than net income, which is not a recipe for rapid returns on investment.	1995-03-16	Paul Chapman Pub., Ltd.

Thompson & Stuart Oskamp Bringing together some of the most active and respected researchers in the field, this volume presents a state-of-the-art, integrated examination of behavioral research aimed at reducing the transmission of HIV. In almost 20 years of battling the AIDS epidemic, one theme has consistently emerged: The solution to stopping the spread of the AIDS virus rests with individual behavior. Understanding and Preventing HIV Risk Behavior grapples with the critical question of how to influence people to change high-risk behaviors, particularly in sexual activity and drug use. The contributors take an in-depth look at the most current HIV and AIDS epidemiological findings; the information-motivation-behavioral skills model of risk behavior; and empirical analyses of contraceptive decision making, denial processes, and the role of attraction in heterosexual behavior. This timely volume also examines research with special populations, including African American youths, Latinos, both gay and straight residents of HIV-impacted communities, active drug users, and adolescents in countries that have different AIDS risk levels and public health policies. Representing the latest in research on safer sex and altering drug use behaviors, Understanding and Preventing HIV Risk Behavior will be a valuable resource for HIV-prevention researchers, community workers, and clinicians who want to utilize research findings in their HIV intervention programs. This volume will also benefit students seeking an up-to-date overview of research on HIV/AIDS risk behavior.	1996	Sage Publications						ZZZ000000
9780803977662	Nietzsche, politics, and modernity,a critique of liberal reason	David Owen		Written in a clear and engaging style, this text demonstrates Nietzsche's significance as a philosopher and as a political theorist by highlighting his critique of liberalism (in both its philosophical and political forms) and by elaborating the form of ethical and political understanding which his philosophy discloses.  In describing Nietzsche's diagnosis of the modern condition, this book explains the central aspects of his thought including the will to power, the Overman and amor fati. David Owen traces the relevance of Nietzsche's philosophy to current debates in political theory and engages with key figures such as MacIntyre, Taylor, Rorty and Rawls.

This is a book for any counsellor or counsellor trainee's shelf, a necessary reference for the sound professional' - Counselling News'The comprehensive series of essays... is a timely contribution.... This book is about being professional and effective... a valuable multimodal life inventory for use with clients is provided' - Counselling, The Journal of The British Association for CounsellingWhat information will help you assess the therapeutic needs of a client?

9780761951063	The future of counselling and psychotherapy	Stephen Palmer&Ved P. Varma		`A thought-provoking volume, and one that brings an expanded perspective... Some aspects are unsettling, some frightening, some so distasteful that my reaction is to find another gig should the future be thus. But I did find myself rethinking at idle moments and rereading most of the volume. The works therein contributed to my own perspective. Well worth buying' - American Journal of Pastoral Counseling`I was admiring of those chapters which took a wide view... This book can be seen as a read-out of a number of attitudes within the profession and within society. Some are partisan or competitive, occupied with the self-justification and proselytizing that is likely to lead to in-fighting. Others see the larger task, the aware repositioning that needs to happen when the world is moving on... this is a book worth reading for the depth and the width of much that is written in it, and not just as a hologram of the present state of the profession. Many contributors give evidence of the self-examination, the awareness of the environment, the largeness of vision and the strictness with self that are prerequisites for humility and learning. They look cautiously forward, both to what might be reached through the profession's best work, and to the reductionist, production-line future that might be a worst outcome of regulation, of confluence and complacent self-interest' - Self & Society`Many authors discuss some common themes for the future... that include increased use of short-term, problem-specific, cost-efficient forms of therapy... all [chapters] were compelling... interesting and readable' - Contemporary Psychology`From the plethora of counselling books to be found in any reputable bookstore these days, this is one I recommend you to buy. The ten chapters give us a flavour of differing philosophical approaches to counselling and psychotherapy. At the same time they provide a medium where leading exponents in the field can share their experience of practice and give their hunches as to where we may be heading as a profession. It makes for a fascinating read: it describes exciting developments already underway and gives a critique of where some developments have been less than helpful... For anyone training, practising, tutoring or designing training courses I would recommend this as a thought-provoking, timely book' - Dialogue`A book with many benefits... on reading this book, the reader is made very aware that the psychotherapeutic professions are embedded in a social and political world. Illustrations are plenty and exceptionally well chosen. For example, Holmes highlights how historical events such as the World Wars or the study of communication systems affected the development of psychotherapeutic systems... examples are clear and thoughtfully put' - British Psychological Society Counselling Psychology Review`The book is enriched by a number of American contributions... I would certainly recommend Palmer and Varma's book as one containing a good cross-section of views about what the millennium holds for counselling' - Counselling, The Journal of The British Association for Counselling`The contributors are... an eminent and eclectic line-up. Each chapter focuses in one way or another on professional, clinical and philosophical issues and on predictions for the field... this is a stimulating collection of views by experienced therapists. It is thoughtful, often contentious and avoids rose-tinted self-satisfaction... This book contains well-written and important polemical and prophetic material, and all trainees and reflective practitioners would benefit from engaging with the diversity of themes presented by the editors. Arguably, none of us involved in the field can practise with integrity unless we are prepared to question the basis, purpose and future of our work' - British Journal of Guidance & Counselling`[An] interesting book..	1997-06-09	Sage Publications						ZZZ000000

9780761953760	Social constructionism, discourse, and realism	Ian Parker		Social Constructionism, Discourse, and Realism charts a clear and accessible path through some of the key debates in contemporary social psychology. Drawing on the wider critical and discursive turn in the human sciences, it explores comprehensively the many claims about what we can know of reality in social constructionist and discursive research in psychology. Key questions addressed by an internationally renowned cast of contributors include: + Should pragmatic and relativist views of meaning and the world necessarily be adopted by discourse analysts? + Where is "the real" in contemporary critical research in psychology? + How does the turn-to-language affect, encourage, or inhibit perspectives for change? These relativist versus realist tensions go to the heart of current theoretical and methodological issues, not only within psychology but across the social and human sciences. By mapping the connections between theory, method, and politics in social research and placing these within the context of the broader social constructionist and discursive debates, this wide ranging book offers the reader an invaluable survey of the current debates. Social Constructionism, Discourse, and Realism will be essential reading for all students of social psychology, social constructionism, discourse analysis, and the philosophy of social sciences.	1998	SAGE Publications						ZZZ000000

Thara		A worthwhile collection of experiences from several non-governmental organizations (NGOs) across India in the field of mental health.... A useful sourcebook in gaining insight of the various non-formal efforts in mental health care delivery in India' - "Psychological Medicine """In the third world, research evidence shows that mental disorders are amongst the commonest and most disabling health problems in the community. The enormous scale of the burden of mental illness becomes worse because of poor access and availability of appropriate health care for most of the sufferers. The non-governmental organizations (NGOs) have played an important role in filling gaps and innovating new models of health care in under-served populations, but their work has rarely been documented. This book is the first comprehensive documentation of the NGO movement that deals with mental health problems in India. It has brought together 17 different NGOs from all regions of the country. They deal with a wide range of mental health and allied issues, from severe mental disorders to substance abuse to trauma and violence to suicide prevention and dementia in the elderly. Successes and limitations of each NGO as a service provider have been critically examined. This book also demonstrates the innovative methods adopted by the NGOs to meet the needs and challenges of mental health. In the last chapter, the editors have drawn lessons from the experience of the NGOs and have linked them to the thematic issues pertaining to the NGO role in mental health services in the country.	2003-05-01	Sage Publications						ZZZ000000

With a focus on improving outcomes for all children, and of closing the gap between those who do well and those who do not, the importance of the early years of children's lives and of supporting families through integrated service provision are now centre stage. Earlier editions of this book have argued for coherent policies for young children and for an expansion of high quality early childhood services. This edition reflects the many developments across the early childhood field in the past few years, with a particular emphasis on working together across agency boundaries to respond effectively to the needs of children and families. Much has been achieved, although there is still progress to be made.

9781412921077	Contemporary issues in the early years	Gillian Pugh&Bernadette Duffy		'This is essential reading for anyone with responsibility for taking the agenda of early childhood services forward' - Nursery World  Since the publication of Every Child Matters in 2003, and the enactment of the 2004 Children's Act, children's services in the UK have undergone - and continue to undergo - a sea change. With a focus on improving outcomes for all children, and of closing the gap between those who do well and those who do not, the importance of the early years of children's lives and of supporting families through integrated service provision are now centre stage. Earlier editions of this book have argued for coherent policies for young children and for an expansion of high quality early childhood services. This edition reflects the many developments across the early childhood field in the past few years, with a particular emphasis on working together across agency boundaries to respond effectively to the needs of children and families. Much has been achieved, although there is still progress to be made.

9780803986398	Media, crisis, and democracy,mass communication and the disruption of social order	Marc Raboy&Bernard Dagenais		"Very useful collection. . . . More thematically coherent than many such volumes. . . . The book is quite topical and readable, considering its depth; most of the authors avoid turgid jargon or intellectual dandyism. . . . The book is not just required reading for academic specialists--it is also accessible to motivated journalists and senior undergraduates. It definitely has a place as a supplementary text in courses on media/ideology, socio-political conflict, and social movements." --Canadian Journal of Communication "Media, Crisis, and Democracy is required reading for anyone with an eye on the future of government. . . . Thought-provoking." --The Journal of Contingencies & Crisis Management "Provocative and radical content. . . . George Gerbner's essay on 'Violence and Terror In and By the Media' bears the hallmarks of lucid and engaging analysis which have typified his distinguished scholastic contribution to media studies for so long. . . . It is an interesting and, on occasion, important discussion of the crucial relationship between media and democracy." --Political Studies In modern states, the smooth functioning of democratic politics is inextricably tied to the role of the media in the creation and dissemination of information, images, and ideas. Utilizing a number of different contexts, Media, Crisis, and Democracy explores the ways in which crises serve to highlight the problematic issues of media performance in democratic states. Further, the book examines the relationship between communication and civil society by asking some difficult yet intriguing questions: To what extent do threats to the sovereignty of the nation-state work to subvert the contribution of the media to the democratic political process? Do crises reveal only the existing ideological and hegemonic functions of the mainstream media? Is "crisis" itself a media construct? Media, Crisis, and Democracy explores these theoretical problems through a number of actual cases of media responses to "crises," events ranging from the Gulf War of 1991 to the recent turmoil in Eastern Europe. These examples emphasize the complexities of understanding the role of the media in struggles of identity around nationality, ethnicity, and gender. Graduate and undergraduate students as well as scholars in political communication, mass communication, and media studies will find this book indispensable.	1992	Sage						ZZZ000000

(The author's) research is an example of inventiveness, diligence and accuracy' - Freerk A. Lootsma, Delft Institute of Technology   Data envelopment Analysis is a Mathematical Programme for measuring performance efficiency of organizational units. The organizational units, termed as decision-making units (DMU) can be of any kind: manufacturing units, a set of schools, banks, hospitals, power plants, police stations, prisons, a set of firms etc.  DEA has been unsuccessfully applied to measure the performance efficiency of these different kinds of DMUs which share a common characteristic - that they are non-profit organization where measurement of performance efficiency is difficult.  DEA has been employed for assessing the relative performance of a set of firms that use a variety of identical inputs-say in the case of a school: quality of students, teachers, grants etc.,-to produce a variety of identical outputs-number of students who pass the final year, average grades obtained by the students in the final   year etc.  DEA assumes the performance of the DMUs by using the concepts of efficiency or productivity which is measured as the ratio of total outputs to total inputs. Also, the efficiencies estimated are relative to the best performing DMU or DMUs. The best performing DMU is given a score of 100% and the performance of other DMUs vary between 0 -100%.	2003-07-01	Sage						ZZZ000000

9781412923552	Cracking the Hard Class	Bill Rogers		Praise for the First Edition:  `In Cracking the Hard Class, the undisputed master of behaviour management, Bill Rogers, shows us that being an effective teacher isn't a result of God-given gifts of charisma and presence, but can be developed through a series of specific skills and learns actions. It's one of the mot useful books around for new teachers... If you can catch him live on one of his UK roadshows, you're in for a real treat. This practical approach from a writer who has clearly retained at least a notional foot in the classroom is the one that works best for me' - Geoff Barton, The Times Education Supplement  `This book would certainly be invaluable to colleagues in the school where some had done the course and others had learnt it second hand. It would have a place in the staffroom of most schools, especially in the secondary sector. Bill Rogers is clearly a charismatic teacher what he offers is based on secure knowledge of child psychology, classroom dynamics and staffroom politics' - Emotional & Behavioural Difficulties  `This is an excellent book for teachers at any key stage who have one or more "difficult" pupils in their class, as well as those with the "hard class". It provides simple and effective behaviour management strategies and makes you realise you are not alone and that it's okay to have a bad day. It mainly discusses secondary education but does refer to primary. Many of the strategies are suitable for all levels anyway. An absolute must-have for a teacher' - Amazon Review  At some point in every teacher's career he/she will encounter the `hard class' and from day one the countdown to the end of the day, term and year is on in earnest. But as demanding as it may be, a difficult class does not have to dominate and permeate through all waking moments. Bill Rogers, in Cracking the Hard Class, Second Edition, highlights many practical strategies that can be implemented to overcome the hard class syndrome.  These include: identifying what makes a class `hard'; developing a class behaviour plan; developing colleague support; following up on disruptive students; changing patterns of bad behaviour; and assisting relief teachers and the hard class.  As well as constructive ideas and strategies, Cracking the Hard Class, Second Edition also highlights the normality of the pressures and stress felt by teachers dealing with these classes.	2006-10-31	Paul Chapman						ZZZ000000

Chris Rojek brings together the insights of Marxism, feminism, Weber, Elias, Simmel, Nietzsche and Baudrillard to produce a survey - and rethinking - of leisure theory. At the same time he presents a radical critique of the traditional `centring' of leisure, on `escape', `freedom' and `choice'.  He describes the relations between capitalism and leisure, the meaning of free time for workers in a capitalist system, and the gendered nature of leisure. He then discusses the social construction of leisure under modernity and the main competing arguments. Finally he examines postmodernity.

While few new rights were attached to the concept its importance lies in its symbolic value and its potential in opening up the future development of a European citizenship.  This authoritative study of European citizenship and its legal and political context illuminates the notion of a citizens' Europe.

9780803981355	Ordinary people in public policy,a behavioural analysis	Richard Rose		Ordinary People and Public Policy offers a wide-ranging exploration of what people receive and expect from government. The book's starting point is that most people spend more time talking to family and friends or acting as consumers than they spend as voters marking ballots. At the same time most families in a mixed economy depend to some extent on the private benefits of public policy for education, health and social security benefits. The growth of government has thus created new links between public institutions and the everyday concerns of citizens.	1989	Sage						ZZZ000000
9780803997431	Voters begin to choose,from closed class to open elections in Britain	Richard Rose&Ian McAllister		This innovative study examines the extent to which voting in Britain since 1959 has been determined by class. Rose and McAllister sum up a vast body of evidence to show that voters are influenced by current political events, by political principles as well as by social structure and by parental party identification. Because of the political changes occuring in Britain today, voters are now open to choose between three parties -- the Conservatives, Labour and the Alliance. The 1983 British general election saw a big shift in votes from a traditional class party, Labour; and a landslide victory for the Conservatives under Margaret Thatcher, notwithstanding a decline in the Conservative vote. Voters Begin to Choose presents evidence of the increasing openness of electoral competition which will be of interest to anyone concerned with what is happening to the electorate as we approach the 1990s.	1986	Sage Publications						ZZZ000000

9780761960751	The plural self,multiplicity in everyday life	John Rowan&Mick Cooper		`[This book's] fundamental thesis is a rather challenging one - the idea that the unified, singular "self", which we all take for granted we possess, does not exist... fascinating and important... I will certainly revisit the book... when you're ready for a challenge, this book is certainly worth dipping into' - Counselling News  `I thoroughly recommend this book. I found it challenging, provocative, exciting and full of delights. (It makes such a change to be told that ideal personality characteristics would include a Monty Pythonesque sense of humour and a tolerance of mind-altering drugs!) While reading it I often felt nourished and refreshed' - The Journal of Critical Psychology, Counselling and Psychotherapy  With the emergence of postmodern thinking, the notion of a unified, singular `self' appears increasingly problematic. Yet for many, postmodernism's proclamation of `the death of the subject' is equally problematic. As a response to this dilemma, there has been a rise of interest in pluralistic models of the `self' in which the person is conceptualized as a multiplicity of subpersonalities, as a plurality of existential possibilities or as a `being' which is inextricably in-dialogue-with-others.  Bringing together many disciplines, and with contributions from foremost writers on self-pluralism, The Plural Self overviews and critiques this emerging field. Drawing together theory, research and practice, the book expands on both the psychological and philosophical theories underlying and associated with self-pluralism, and presents empirical evidence in support of the self-pluralistic perspective, exploring its application within a clinical and therapeutic setting.	1999-02-23	Sage Publications						ZZZ000000

This series is intended to provide a forum for a scholarly analysis of a theme that will be of interest to the international research community. This book fulfils this aim admirably and I can recommend it to anyone with an interest in educational research' - British Journal of Educational Psychology 'of use and interest to those presently engaged in educational research and evaluating educational policy. It certainly provides food for thought for all those in educational research community' - Widening Participation and Lifelong Learning During the last few years there have been increasingly vigorous debates about the adequacy of educational research in the UK. Is it worth the money spent on it? Is it influenced enough by the user communities who ought to benefit most from it? Does it focus on the right kinds of questions? How does it compare with research in other possibly comparable fields, like medicine and engineering? Does it draw adequately on new developments in related social sciences? Is it effectively organized? Are there too many inadequately qualified people doing educational research? These are some of the questions that have been hotly debated, mainly within the educational research community itself. This book brings together many of the major figures in British educational research. Four central chapters, based on previously unpublished recent reviews of the current state of educational research and of the future directions it should take, are the focus of critical commentaries from many different perspectives. In the opening chapter the two editors, both recent presidents of the British Educational Research Association, explain the context of the arguments, and in the final chapter synthesize the issues involved. Major changes in the conduct and organization of British educational research must be anticipated in the next few years. This book sets the scene for those changes	1998-12	Paul Chapman						ZZZ000000
9780761966074	An introduction to modern financial reporting theory	Brian A. Rutherford		The adoption by the Accounting Standards Board of its Statement of Principles for Financial Reporting in December 1999 means that we now have an authoritative conceptual framework which should govern the production of British financial statements. Yet while the text of the Statement is directed at members of the accounting profession, students of accounting will need to understand the framework and its repercussions.  An Introduction to Modern Financial Reporting Theory explains the content of the Statement in an accessible language, specifically for the student of accounting and finance. This text will be of direct and practical interest to students who need to understand the contents of the new framework, which helps to explain: why and how financial reporting is carried out; why financial statements are prepared in the way that they are; why accounting standards specify one method rather than another; how the methods specified by accounting standards relate to each other; how practice has developed and will continue to develop.  Brian Rutherford emphasizes and enlarges on the key features of the framework, provides many more examples, shows how the framework applies in practice and also offers some criticisms of its content. The book clarifies to students why various methods and practices in accounting have evolved, while illustrating how they relate to each other and to the underlying function of financial reporting.  This text will be essential reading on university and professional courses in advanced financial accounting, particularly courses on Accounting Theory and Financial Reporting.  Brian Rutherford is Professor of Accounting at Canterbury Business School, University Kent at Canterbury.	2000-09-30	Paul Chapman						ZZZ000000

Building on a model for evaluating the relationships between families, schools and children, the contributors analyze: how school achievement is influenced by parent-child interactions; how early adolescents are affected by the overlapping `spheres of influence' of school, family, community and peer group; and how family environment influences educational attainment. Other issues discussed include: education for children with learning difficulties; school truancy; and the effects of parental discord and divorce on children's learning.

Schools and school systems therefore need to acquire the skills - such as research, assessment and evaluation - necessary to make local control work, as these skills are not significant elements of the current teacher preparation curriculum.

9780803932180	Information campaigns,balancing social values and social change	Charles T. Salmon		Today, more than ever before, governments, industry, and special interest groups are employing information campaigns to effect social change. In ground-breaking fashion, Information Campaigns explores theory of campaigns as well as theory for campaigns, addressing the social context of public information campaigns and social marketing efforts. Using an interdisciplinary approach, Salmon and a distinguished team of contributors develop the theoretical framework of social change to discuss the melding of marketing and strategic communication traditions. Part I reviews the social context in which campaigns are designed, implemented, and analyzed, illustrating a broad range of social concerns campaigns address. The second section analyzes tactical concerns pertaining to underlying components of campaigns, namely audience research, planning, organization and implementation, and evaluation. Students and professionals in the fields of communication, political science, marketing, and public health will benefit from the refreshing approach and provocative analyses in this volume. "This is a terrific book. It presents a unique integration of value and ideological perspectives with the empirical research on information campaigns. The book offers a thorough and readable analysis of the diverse literature in this area." --Richard M. Perloff, Cleveland State University "The [first] section as a whole is particularly successful in providing a context for the study of campaigns within the ongoing processes of social change. . . . The second section of the book offers some interesting treatments of several . . . components of the campaign process. . . . This collection goes a long way toward establishing a new framework within which to study campaigns. . . . It lays out some clear directions and challenges for future research." --Journal of Communication "Salmon's Information Campaigns is a welcome addition to the literature. . . . [This book] enlarges our knowledge of the processes involved in media-centered social change and how social systems . . . act to influence the attitudes, perceptions, and behaviors of different publics. . . . Salmon's book is a refreshing departure from the approach generally taken in the information campaign literature. Having carefully assembled authors from a wide range of disciplines and representing divergent theoretical perspectives and research orientations, Salmon provides a balanced presentation of the values of intended receivers and sponsors of planned social change. He gives as much importance to the values of campaign sponsors as he does to the values of receivers of 'social good.' . . . Practitioners, researchers, and students will find the book useful . . . particularly useful for graduate-level courses in political communication, development communication, health communication, strategic communication, and social marketing." --Journal of Broadcasting and Electronic Media "Unlike many edited volumes, quality is consistent across chapters." --Journalism Quarterly	1989	Sage Publications						ZZZ000000

Sampath		Family businesses in India face an uphill task in adapting to the new business climate ushered in by the opening up of the economy. Using three longitudinal case studies spanning fifteen years, Professor Sampath provides a comprehensive discussion of the problems and dynamics of family businesses in transition. Drawing upon his direct consulting experience with family organizations, he analyses their growth through different phases of being managed by the progenitors (founders) and their successors. He highlights the dilemmas faced by family organizations owing to conflicting cultures between the founders anchored in traditional value systems and the next generation, which is primarily schooled in western theories. The book discusses the ways and means these differences can be resolved and develops a unique entrepreneurial growth model for running a successful family enterprise taking into account the cultural dynamics.	2001-06-01	Response Books						ZZZ000000

9780761951902	Feminism and psychotherapy,reflections on contemporary theories and practices	I. Bruna Seu&M. Colleen Heenan		The central question that Seu and Heenan have posed to contributors to this book is to explore critically how their feminist beliefs, understandings and commitments inform their work as psychotherapeutic practitioners and researchers. What we are offered is a multiplicity of feminist and psychotherapeutic narratives... The book raises a very serious issue about the nature of the feminist project within psychotherapy... The editors and contributors have created a brave book which articulates the dilemmas of feminist thought and practice within the contexts of therapeutic engagement' - British Journal of Guidance and CounsellingChallenging the notion that one model of therapy or one model of feminism can be privileged above others, this volume reflects on the complexities and multiple dimensions of theory and practice in contemporary feminist psychotherapies.Practitioners and researchers representing a broad cross-section of viewpoints critically consider their feminist therapeutic frameworks to address from within the practice the ways in which feminist therapy has set gender above and beyond other social inequalities. Drawing on case material from clinical practice, as well as research on feminism and psychotherapy, the authors demonstrate how the tensions inherent in different therapeutic models and feminist beliefs both question and reinforce popular notions of `gender' and `woman'.	1998-05-21	SAGE						ZZZ000000

9780761970132	Embodying the monster,encounters with the vulnerable self	Margrit Shildrick		'(A) consistently interesting and provocative work, which offers a great deal in seven chapters. It marks an innovative interdisciplinary approach to questions of embodiment and subjectivity' - Disability and Society  'This is an elegantly written book which has, as its main aim, to rethink the idea of difference in the western imaginary through a consideration of two themes: monsters and how these have come to define, but potentially to deconstruct, normality; and the whole idea of vulnerability and the vulnerable and the extent to which such a state is one that all of us are constantly in danger of entering ... The theoretical and philosophical content - Derrida, Lacan, Foucault, Irrigaray, Butler, Levinas, and Haraway in particular - together with the range of empirical examples used to illustrate the arguments, make the book an ideal one for third level undergraduates and for post-graduates, particularly those studying the sociology of embodiment, feminist theory, critical theory and cultural studies. Shildrick accomplishes the task of making difficult ideas comprehensible without reducing them to the simplistic' - Sociology  Written by one of the most distinguished commentators in the field, this book asks why we see some bodies as `monstrous' or `vulnerable' and examines what this tells us about ideas of bodily `normality' and bodily perfection.  Drawing on feminist theories of the body, biomedical discourse and historical data, Margrit Shildrick argues that the response to the monstrous body has always been ambivalent. In trying to organize it out of the discourses of normality, we point to the impossibility of realizing a fully developed, invulnerable self. She calls upon us to rethink the monstrous, not as an abnormal category, but as a condition of attractivenes, and demonstrates how this involves an exploration of relationships between bodies and embodied selves, and a revising of the phenomenology of the body.	2002	SAGE						ZZZ000000

9780761950295	Long-term counselling	Geraldine Shipton&Eileen Smith		`This book makes a welcome appearance in today's climate where the stress is upon short-term, brief, focused counselling and therapy... the approach of the authors is comprehensive and thorough. They look at many issues which arise in the debate about long-term counselling... [it is] a very useful book for those in training. It would also be of interest to those already in practice who are involved in or considering long-term work. Where I think the book scores, especially in a society where many voices speak out against counselling in general and long-term counselling in particular, is that it constantly stresses the need for counsellors to remain open and aware, to take a professional approach, to be well-supported and supervised, to monitor their work, and to be concerned with their personal and professional development... I wish to give the authors credit for taking on the task of presenting the case for long-term counselling. They have treated the subject with care and respect, and have done credit to counselling's "unsung craft" ' - British Journal of Guidance and Counselling`Geraldine Shipton and Eileen Smith's contribution goes a long way towards filling a gap in the literature. As such it is invaluable for counsellors, trainers and supervisors working in an area of counselling which is now more usually to be found in the private sector but which, the authors argue on grounds of humanity and economics, should be available for all who need it... a valuable source for all those working with clients long term' - Counselling, The Journal of the British Association for Counselling`The strength of this book comes from the authors' obvious extensive experience of undertaking long-term counselling. It is crammed with insights, observations and anecdotes that could only have come from people who really do know the tribulations and occasional joys of this type of work' - Clinical Psychology Forum`The book pivots on six imaginary and convincing case studies, describing counselling within a variety of voluntary and statutory agencies, a range of client backgrounds, presenting problems, counsellor ability and outcome. These case presentations successfully lift the book out of the ordinary run of earnest contemplation of the counselling scene. The brain stays working; challenged and intrigued.... Rather like the best traditions in counselling, the book represents an astute balancing act. The structure, style and attitude of the book give the impression of an easy read but has has broad and deep ambitions. The co-authors achieve a digestible combination of new and old; intellect and feelings, skills and theory; good humour and hard work. They offer food for thought and development to readers from differing backgrounds and needs' - Sally Day, Psychodynamic CounsellingCounselling can be a long-term process, whether by initial design or because of the emergence of new concerns within work originally planned as short-term or focused. Occasionally, counselling is long-term by default, when the counsellor or client cannot face ending or when the counsellor cannot envisage other ways of working with a client. This book examines the complex and varied issues which can arise, with an emphasis throughout on skilled, professional and ethical practice.Encouraging trainees and practitioners to think about the day-to-day realities and issues of long-term work, the book considers working parameters and issues of definition, setting and orientation. It also focuses on assessing and managing the work, and discusses the practical and emotional concerns which will require thought as the relationship between the counsellor and client is established, develops, or falters and ends. Detailed case histories illustrate who might benefit from long-term counselling and give some sense of the nature of the relationships which may arise in long-term work.	1998-04-14	SAGE						ZZZ000000
9780803948792	Individual differences in language development	Cecilia M. Shore		Do all children learn language in the same way? Is the apparent "fast" vs. "slow" language learning rate among children a reflection of the individual child's approach to language acquisition? This volume explores the importance that individual differences have in acquiring language and challenges some of the widely held theories of linguistic development. Focusing on children ages one to three, the author describes characteristic differences in terms of vocabulary, grammatical, and phonological development, and considers whether distinctive "styles" of language development can be defined. In addition, the social and cognitive influences that can explain these differences are examined. The book concludes with a look at new language theories such as ecological, chaos, and connectionist approaches and considers what individual differences in development can tell us about the mechanisms of language development. Individual Differences in Language Development is invaluable for professionals and researchers in developmental psychology, family studies, education, psychology, and communication. "Cecilia M. Shore puts forward an alternative theory on differences in language development and offers an important message on the significance of context in children's early language acquisition. The principal theme has significant implications for further research as well as practical implications for teacher trainers, teachers and parents." --Durante's "Cecilia M. Shore writes in a warm and engaging style. . . . It serves her purpose well: to put across complex ideas in a clear and unforgettable form. . . . The content is right on target. Shore covers all the relevant issues in this complex area, and her review is right up to date." --Elizabeth Bates, Professor of Psychology and Professor of Cognitive Science, University of California, San Diego	1995-02-02	Sage Publications						ZZZ000000

9780761932024	The gendered nation,contemporary writings from South Asia	Neluka Silva		This book narrativises contemporary history by examining literary texts in the background of nation-building and the anti-colonial struggle in India, Sri Lanka, Pakistan and Bangladesh. The representation of nation in literary writings from these countries reflects certain shared phenomena of an exploitative ruling elite, communal violence based on linguistic, ethnic and/or religious differentials, and the formation of ethno-religious identities.  The female body becomes a terrain on which nationalist distinctions are made visible. The mind/body dualism and its wide-ranging institutional and cultural expressions get reflected in nationalist discourse and literature. The image of the Nation as a female body or mother earth functions in one of two ways-either as a `pure' maternal body, spiritual, inviolable and in tact or, as bruised, ravaged, raped and violated by invaders. Both these representations are contingent upon the input of a male actor, who deifies, defends and resolves them.   The author examines the critical moments in the history of contemporary South Asia as represented in literary and political culture. Four stages within nation-formation are identified in the book. Each chapter explores a different stage of this process in a specific historical moment in four nations through literary representations. These moments are explored through the notion of `gendering'.	2004	SAGE						ZZZ000000
9780803976627	Discourses of counselling,HIV counselling as social interaction	David Silverman		In this book, David Silverman offers a fully researched and analytically sensitive account of how counselling, as a process, is dynamically constructed through the interaction of counsellor and client. Drawing on research on counselling of clients undergoing an HIV test, the author explores the ways in which conversations between counsellors and clients reflect, embody and subtly alter assumptions about the purpose, method and practice of counselling.This critical appreciation of the modes of engagement between counsellor and client will be of interest to researchers and students of counselling, psychotherapy and associated helping professions. Practitioners - particularly those involved in HIV and other health counselling - will be stimulated to reflect on and respond to Silverman's analysis in their own practice. The book will also be essential reading for researchers and students in the traditions of sociological work on interactionism, conversation analysis and ethnomethodology, applying these approaches in a sophisticated manner to the interactionist and conversational strategies adopted in a health promotion environment.	1997	Sage						ZZZ000000

Are social critics contaminated by the same ideological distortions they identify in society?The text reviews different responses to such dilemmas and thus examines ways to reconstruct social theory and critique following the postmodern attack on the traditional foundations of knowledge.

9780803955608	Perceived control, motivation, & coping	Ellen A. Skinner		At every point in the life span, individual differences in a sense of control are strong predictors of motivation, coping, success, and failure in a wide range of life domains. What are the origins of these individual differences, how do they develop, and what are the mechanisms by which they exert such influence on psychological functioning? This book draws on theories and research covering key control constructs, including self-efficacy, learned helplessness, locus of control, and attribution theory. Ellen A. Skinner discusses such issues as the origins of control in social interactions; environmental features that promote or undermine control; developmental change in the mechanisms by which experiences of control have their effects on action; and the implications for intervening into the competence system, including interventions for people in uncontrollable circumstances. Written at a level appropriate for upper-division undergraduates, the book can serve as a supplement to the social and personality development course as well as a core text for motivation, educational psychology, or clinical courses at the graduate level. This book won't be the first one on the topic, but it will be the first one that professionals and graduate students turn to whenever they want a definitive opinion on complex questions of control or an idea for cutting-edge research on the topic of motivation, coping, and control.	1995-02-14	Sage Publications						ZZZ000000

9780761955177	Resisting McDonaldization	Barry Smart		George Ritzer's McDonaldization thesis argued that contemporary life is succumbing to the standardization, flexibility and practicability of fast-food service. This book brings together specially commissioned papers by leading social and cultural analysts to engage in a critical appraisal of the thesis. The contributors discuss the roots of the thesis, the rationalization of late modern life, the effects of increasing cultural commodification, the continuing prominence of American cultural and economic imperialism and the impact of globalization on social and cultural life. The strengths and weaknesses of the McDonaldization thesis are clearly evaluated and the irrational consequences of rationalization are pinpointed and critically developed. The book enlarges our understanding of how everyday life is structured by new standards of bureaucratic control and performance-related criteria and plays a major role in illuminating how identity and practice are structured today. The volume concludes with a response from George Ritzer.	1999	Sage						ZZZ000000

He analyzes both the changes themselves and their implications for the ways in which we think about the mass media, while also demonstrating that most of the orthodox accounts of the end of communism are seriously flawed. There are much greater continuities between the old system and the new than are captured by the theories that argue that there has been a radical and fundamental change.Instead of marking the end of critical inquiry or the end of history, as some have suggested, Sparks argues that the collapse of the communist systems demonstrates how very limited and frequently incorrect the main ways of discussing the mass media are. He concludes with a provocative discussion of the ways in which we need to modify our thinking in the light of these developments.	1998	SAGE Publications						ZZZ000000

But to what end? Is helping people really therapy's main mission? This provocative book explores the alternatives to psychotherapeutic orthodoxies on such vital issues as sexuality; the self; the unconscious; creativity; and the dilemma of evil. Erensto Spinelli challenges psychotherapy, asking if it has retreated from its early promise of being a pivotal agent in our attempts to discover what it means to be human, in exchange for its current role as a pacifier of personal and social unease.	2003-02-01	SAGE Publications						PSY028000

9780761908791	State devolution in America,implications for a diverse society	Janet E. Kodras&Lynn A. Staeheli&Colin Flint&Association of American Geographers. Meeting		Transforming American Government explores the "reinventing of government" and the dramatic policy changes that affect both the scope and scale of government. Devolution, privatization, and dismantling of state functions are forcing us to search for new divisions of responsibility among national, state, and local governments. At the heart of this reorganization is the issue of geographically distributing power and resources on a diverse map of regional conditions and political cultures. This assemblage of social scientists analyzes the impetus, nature, and impact of state devolution. While debates over such changes typically center on economic, political, and social change, these authors shift the debate to an examination of the complex geographical implications of devolution. In a society as territorially fragmented and diverse as the U.S., changes in the form and function of government are experienced differently in different parts of the country. This comprehensive volume details the outcomes of restructuring and explores how the redistribution of resources and responsibilities affects the lives of all Americans.	1997	Sage Publications						ZZZ000000

How this transformation took place is the focus of this fascinating volume. Here, many of the key figures in the post-World War II development of race research tell their own stories--of their experiences with race and racism, of the developing interest in understanding race as a social force, and of the major milestones that established it as a legitimate research domain. Through a mixture of personal and intellectual biographical information by such noted figures as Bob Blauner, Daniel Fusfeld, Milton Gordon, Lewis Killian, Harry Kitano, Hyland Lewis, Stanley Lieberson, Thomas Pettigrew, Richard Robbins, Peter Rose, Pierre van den Berghe, and Frank Westie, this collection of life histories gives the reader an insider's history of this exciting field of study.

The contributors, all well-known feminist academics, discuss the epistemological and ontological `borderlands' that feminisms inhabit, which although within, still remain `other' to, the academy. The book addresses fundamentally important questions such as: Should feminists work within traditional disciplines or abandon them in favour of Women's Studies?

9780803943339	Social research on children and adolescents,ethical issues	Barbara Stanley&Joan E. Sieber&National Institutes of Health (U.S.). Office for Protection from Research Risks		A first in its field, this timely volume effectively bridges the gap between the legal requirements that govern research on minors and the research methodology literature in adolescent psychology. The editors skillfully bring together the insights of a group of leading researchers and scholars to address and resolve the following issues: what theory and research on human development can tell researchers about adolescents' vulnerability to several kinds of risk research and how to reduce that vulnerability; what the law says about young peoples' rights to privacy; how the relevant ethical theory or guidelines should apply to minors approaching adulthood; under what circumstances parental consent does not protect children's rights; and how one explains the research process to a young adult. Social Research on Children and Adolescents reaches a wide audience from professionals in development psychology, family studies, and education to researchers in evaluation, research methods, and sociology to students in the above fields; all will undoubtedly benefit from this book. "Social Research on Children and Adolescents is an invaluable resource for researchers who confront questions such as how to assess risks and benefits within a developmental framework, what legal constraints and ethical principles guide research practice, and how to explain research participation to youth who differ greatly in their comprehension of the enterprise. . . . The major strength of this book, aside from its effective integration of developmental theory and research ethics, is the repeated examination of concrete research problems in light of ethical principles and legal requirements. . . . [This book] will be a useful addition to the library of any social scientist who conducts psychological research with children." --Death Studies	1992	Sage Publications						ZZZ000000

9780803986992	Practical knowledge,applying the social sciences	Nico Stehr		The status of the social sciences as knowledge presents two fundamental problems. The first is epistemological: In what sense is the subject of the social sciences known and knowable? The second, pragmatic: Can knowledge generated by the social sciences be applied, and with what consequences? In Practical Knowledge, Nico Stehr offers a major reassessment of the utility of social science knowledge. In reassessing the practical value of social science, Stehr examines a classic case of the application of social science on a grand scale: Keynesian economics. To what extent can the political, social, and economic policies pursued in Keynesian economics be related to Keynesian ideas as social science? Arguing for a reconception of the ways in which social scientific knowledge can be and is applied, this volume will be of great interest to a broad range of social scientists including social theorists, economic theorists, sociologists of knowledge, historians of the social sciences, and those involved in social policy. "This is one of the most insightful contemporary treatments of the potential for a pragmatic sociology--'sociology as enlightenment.' It builds explicitly on Mannheim's thoughts about a scientific politics, and draws widely on contemporary German theories of the action-praxis matrix. . . . Stehr's vision is irrepressible." --Contemporary Sociology "An important first step to lure academic social science out of its present deadlock and to alter the widely shared perception of its deficits. Built around a case study of Keynes' success in producing 'knowledge for practice,' Stehr argues for the necessity of 'practical knowledge' as a special kind of social science knowledge that takes its context of application into account. A pragmatic social science will thus have to become enriched not only in knowing its local contingencies, but in anticipating also the contingencies of its own societal use." --Helga Nowotny, University of Vienna "This thought-provoking little book is bucking a trend within social science theory. It has avoided the dead-end alley of post-modernist, post-structuralist and de-constructionist word games addressing the serious problems which constitute the crisis of social science in our time." --The Canadian Journal of Sociology	1992	Sage						ZZZ000000

Students who use it are lucky to have such a feast provided, and they are bound to find the material both challenging and stimulating... there is much more about self issues in this text than in any comparable social psychology text. And that, in itself, is a major achievement' - Self & Society'An absolutely terrific book - very innovative and in some ways really revolutionary: a wonderfully thoughtful volume... designed to teach people not just about social psychology, but how to think social psychology' - Jerome Bruner, New York University'This is the most forward looking text I have ever encountered. Where most textbooks are composed of dry summaries of past accomplishments, the present volume draws students into dialogue on cutting-edge issues. Both teachers and students will be enriched' - Kenneth Gergen, Swarthmore College, PennsylvaniaThis accessible, broad-based and authoritative textbook explores theories and research relating to the self for students of personality and social psychology. A feature of the book is that it is designed to provoke reflection in readers, both on their own experience and on the nature of social psychological understanding.It engages with contemporary debates about the nature of self by contrasting original and leading-edge treatments from five perspectives: biological; cognitive-experimental; experiential; social constructionist; and psychodynamic. The concluding chapter explores how these perspectives interrelate, through a discussion of the dilemmas of self and identity in modern society.Understanding the Self is one of three books which form the core of the Open University's course Social Psychology: Personal Lives, Social Worlds.	1996-02	Sage Publications in association with the Open University						ZZZ000000

9781853961809	New wave manufacturing strategies,organizational and human resource management dimensions	John Storey		Over the past decade, many companies have adopted new strategies for manufacturing, which have taken their competitiveness on to new planes. A whole array of initiatives, such as FMS, JIT, TQM, CIM, and MRP II, have been introduced. This book deals with the far-reaching significance of these new approaches - collectively labelled "new wave manufacturing".  Considerable research evidence as well as practitioners' own experiences make one crucial point time and time again. The organizational as well as the human resource management aspects of these new strategies are critical to their success or failure. The underlying theme which is tackled in this book, therefore, is to what extent do these new operational strategies require a matching set of organizational and HR strategies?  By looking at the issues through the joint eyes of production and behavioural analysts, this book provides an unique introduction to the new developments in manufacturing as well as providing an up-to-date assessment of the organizational and H R dimensions to these methods.  New Wave Manufacturing Strategies has a vision which goes beyond the "new technology"/advanced manufacturing technology discussions.  The chapters have been written in a clear, accessible manner by leading experts from Europe, the USA and Australia as well as from the UK.	1994	P. Chapman						ZZZ000000

The authors describe detailed strategies for action and show how these can be applied within a range of contexts and settings. In an attempt to bridge the gap that persists between ideological perspectives and practical implementations, they delve beyond the rhetoric of empowerment and show how it can be incorporated into practice.   Focusing particularly on the synergistic relationship between policy and education, the book re-appraises the notion of health education - an idea which has become marginalised in recent years- and shows the fundamental importance of education in creating individual choice and generating effective advocacy for social change.  The question of `evidence' is central to the text and the book concludes by examining methods of evaluation and the role it plays in creating more effective health promotion programmes.	2004	SAGE						ZZZ000000

9780803975507	Anthony Giddens and modern social theory	Kenneth H. Tucker		Giddens is widely recognized as one of the most important sociologists of the post-war period. But there has been a surprising failure in the academic literature to place his work in the context of other theoretical positions and research traditions. Consequently, there has been a vagueness about what is unique or different about Giddens's social theory. This is the first full-length work to examine Giddens's social theory. It guides the reader through Giddens's early attempt to overcome the duality of structure and agency. Giddens himself saw this duality as a major failing of social theories of modernity. His attempt to resolve the problem can be regarded as the key to the development of his brandmark "structuration theory." The book investigates the ways in which Giddens's approach to agency and institutions draws on theorists such as Wittgenstein and Goffman, who failed to develop a "macro" approach to sociology. Giddens's far-reaching work has also touched on issues such as the transformation of modern intimacy and sexuality and the fate of politics in late modern society. The text systematically relates Giddens's theoretical concepts to modern social theory. It compare and contrasts his work with major currents in social theory, including the work of Habermas, Foucault, Bourdieu, Elias, and Parsons and with schools of thought such as feminism, ethnomethodology, Marxism, symbolic interactionism and postmodernism. This book is the most complete and thorough assessment of Giddens's work that is currently available. It incorporates insights from many different perspectives into his theory of structuration, his work on the formation of cultural identities, and the fate of the nation-state. This book will be required reading for anyone who wants to gain a reliable, critically aware introduction to Giddens's social theory. It will be particularly interesting to students of sociology and cultural studies.	1998	Sage						ZZZ000000

It will be welcomed by all students of cultural studies, sociology and media studies.	1999-09-24	SAGE						ZZZ000000
9780761956075	Performing culture,stories of expertise and the everyday	John Tulloch		Performing Culture presents a detailed and probing account of cultural studies' changing fixations with theory, method, policy, text, production, audience and the micro-politics of the everyday.  John Tulloch encourages academics and students to take seriously the need to break down the separation between high and low cultural studies. Tulloch's case studies show that the performance of cultural meanings occurs in forms as diverse as The Royal Shakespeare Company's Shakespeare and Chekhov productions and our everyday work and leisure encounters. Drawing upon anthropological and dramatic studies of performance, the book emphasizes that academic research also performs cultural meaning. A central feature of the book is its reflexive consideration of the representations of culture constructed by academic 'experts'.	1999	Sage Publications						ZZZ000000

9780803975989	Medical power and social knowledge	Bryan S. Turner&Colin Samson		This new edition includes a completely revised chapter on mental health, new chapters on the sociology of the body and on the relationship between health and risk in contemporary societies. Author Bryan S. Turner assesses the ways in which different social theorists have interpreted the experience of health and disease and the social relations and power structures involved in the medical practice. He examines health as an aspect of social action and looks at the problem of health at three levels-the individual, the social, and the societal. Among the perspectives analyzed are Parsons's view of the "sick role" and the patient's relation to society, Foucault's critique of medical models of madness and sexuality, Marxist and feminist debates on the relation of health and medicine to capitalism and patriarchy, and the contribution of Beck to the sociological understanding of environmental pollution and hazard in the politics of health. The fully revised edition of this successful textbook, Medical Power and Social Knowledge, Second Edition, provides a comprehensive introduction to medical sociology and an assessment of its significance for social theory and the social sciences.	1995	Sage Publications						ZZZ000000

9780803986138	Citizenship and social rights,the interdependence of self and society	Fred Twine		This broad-ranging text offers an analysis of the idea of citizenship and its relevance to social problems and social policies in advanced industrial societies. Twine demonstrates that two concepts are essential to an understanding of the issue of citizenship: the socially embedded nature of human agents, and their interdependence both with each other and with the natural and social worlds they inhabit. Twine emphasizes the social nature of individual needs and individual rights. He shows that interdependence is not limited to the mutual linkages within advanced industrial societies, but extends both to the relations between advanced and developing nations and to the environmental contexts of human existence.	1994	Sage						ZZZ000000

9780803945647	Multivariate Analysis of Categorical Data: Theory	John P. Geer		"This approach to data analysis represents an important and original school of thought." Short Book Reviews, Publication of the International Statistical Institute "The volume begins with an excellent discussion of data treatment, with an emphasis on the fact that the statistical and modeling treatment depends on choices and decisions made by the analyst. I believe that this is an important and often overlooked point, and I appreciated John P. Van de Geer's emphasis on the responsibility of the analyst. . . . Van de Geer is quite conscious of addressing a relatively broad audience, based on the care taken to provide interpretations of results in the context of various functional areas. . . . The volume is at its best (which is really good!) when Van de Geer is describing implications of the results, providing wonderfully intuitive interpretations of relations and of byproducts of the analytical approach. An example of this strength of the book is the discussion of the implication of optimal quantification with respect to eigenvalues on page 56. (I must admit that I have never felt as comfortable with eigenvalues and their interpretation as I did while reading this book!)." --Elizabeth L. Rose in Structural Equation Modeling Quote for both books "The set would be appropriate for use in a graduate course, with guidance from an instructor who has expertise in this approach to multivariate analysis. The interested researcher will find the set to be very helpful, particularly in terms of developing a coherent and accurate interpretation of the results." --Elizabeth L. Rose in Structural Equation Modeling Aimed at researchers and students interested in non-linear analysis of categorical variables, Multivariate Analysis of Categorical Data explains multivariate analysis geometrically rather than through the use of formal algebraic formulae. Asterisked sections, however, are included that present an algebraic explanation for readers who are more familiar with classical multivariate analysis. The author first covers what the desirable properties of a geometric display should look like on the basis of classical analysis. Next, he discusses how these desirable properties can be enhanced by gradually eliminating the restrictions imposed by a priori technique. He then explores such topics as the relation of principal components analysis; canonical analysis and generalized canonical analysis to one another; optimal quantification for one, two, and three variables; and how many dimensions are needed for optimal quantification. This book is appropriate for readers who have some familiarity with multivariate analysis.	1993	Sage						ZZZ000000

9780803988811	The condition of citizenship	Bart van Steenbergen		The idea of citizenship can be seen as a unifying element in understanding contemporary social change and social problems: in The Condition of Citizenship, Bart Van Steenbergen presents and discusses various illustrations of this theme. Outlining the traditional linkages between citizenship and public participation as well as national identity and social welfare, the book shows the relevance of citizenship for a range of current issues extending from global change through gender to the environment. The areas investigated include: the challenge of internationalization to the nation state and to national identities; the contested nature of citizenship in relation to poverty, work and welfare; the implications of gender inequality; and the potential for new conceptions of citizenship in response to cultural and political change.

9780803939967	Child psychiatric epidemiology,concepts, methods, and findings	Frank C. Verhulst&Hans M. Koot		If you're looking for a concise resource that examines child psychiatric epidemiology, then look no further. In this excellent volume, Verhulst and Koot answer a wide variety of questions pertaining to the etiology, the course, and therapy of child psychiatric conditions. Central issues related to diagnosis, assessment, sampling, and cross-cultural studies are presented in a highly readable fashion. Research on prevalence and patterns of childhood dysfunction and how these are influenced by such factors as age, sex, and social class are examined in detail. Verhulst and Koot also provide a detailed description of community surveys and offer a referral pathway to psychiatric care for children. Child Psychiatric Epidemiology provides critical, epidemiological concepts, designs, and information for psychiatrists, psychologists, researchers, health care providers and students. "This must be one of the most intelligent books a child psychiatrist has a chance and a reason to read. In fact, it is a book which anyone with an interest in the epidemiology of mental phenomena, whether these relate to children or not, should read. . . . The book packs a far bigger punch than its 140 odd pages would suggest. There is always enough substance to bit into, and its style is didactic, critical, and analytical; the material is dissected rather than presented. The reader is guided through concepts, research designs, definitions of caseness, tools, sampling methods, with examples and demonstrations from all the major epidemiological child psychiatric studies, at a very satisfying depth.

9780803929821	Statistical applications in criminal justice	Gennaro F. Vito&Edward J. Latessa		Statistical Applications in Criminal Justice introduces basic statistical concepts in a "cookbook" approach to guide math-scared students to an understanding of the utility and value of statistical analysis. Using examples drawn entirely from law and criminal justice research, the authors provide a user-friendly text for undergraduate and statistically naive graduate students of criminal justice. Vito and Latessa begin with an introduction to simple mathematical notation and proceed into a discussion of the theoretical bases of statistics--with particular attention paid to probability, sampling, and hypothesis testing. Once the student has developed a firm mastery of these basic tools, the authors present some basic statistical techniques commonly used in criminal justice research--t-tests, correlations, simple regression, ANOVA, and measures of association. Sample problems are provided to assist the student step-by-step through the application of these techniques. Uniquely written for criminal justice students, this book would be an appropriate supplement to accompany a longer research methods or statistics text. In addition, professionals who wish to brush up on their skills would find its self-teaching features useful.	1989-07-12	Sage Publications						ZZZ000000
9780761936190	Alternative Schooling in India	Sarojini Vittachi&Neeraja Raghavan&Kiran Raj		This book studies the innovative methods of learning used in some alternative Indian schools. It sheds light on places of learning where the learning process is fun for the teacher as well as the students, in contrast to the intense examination-oriented learning in mainstream schools. Researched data on alternative schools in the country, offers the reader an array of institutions all over the country where efforts are being made to bring about a difference to traditional ways of learning and teaching. It includes exclusive articles by leading practitioners who offer an insight into ground reality when a certain philosophy is applied to a school. It also contains accounts based on the experience of how such alternative practices mould the learner and teacher, and impact the parent as well. In the latter part of the book is a directory of alternative schools in India. Most are tucked away in remote corners of the country. Interestingly, the common thread binding these 'alternative schools' is the welfare of the child in addition to that of the teachers, who love their work as opposed to merely doing a job.	2007-10-25	Sage Publications						ZZZ000000
9780761951803	Managing knowledge,perspectives on cooperation and competition	George Von Krogh&Johan Roos		Using both established as well as more recent modes of inquiry, this book sheds new light on an increasingly important dimension of organizational cooperation and competition - that of knowledge and knowledge transfer. Based on research and practice, the book addresses a wide range of issues concerning the management of knowledge, from knowledge transfer between organizations to knowledge management within organizations.Divided into two parts, Managing Knowledge reflects a fundamental conceptual distinction between two world-views. The first part is characterized by representationism, or traditional approaches to viewing knowledge, knowledge transfer and cooperative strategies. The contributors provide a clear overview of the current research on knowledge management, and bring together studies on the sociology of knowledge, strategic management and learning theory. The second part focuses on anti-representationism, or new perspectives on knowledge and knowledge transfer in organizational cooperation. These perspectives, based on autopoiesis theory, go far beyond conventional ways of perceiving and managing knowledge and their implications for management theory and practice are fully examined.	1996	Sage Publications						ZZZ000000
9780761900320	New approaches to family practice,confronting economic stress	Nancy R. Vosler		How do economic stresses on the family - such as dual-earner parents, unemployment, and poverty - affect the human service professional's assessment of the families he or she serves? The field of family sociology is now providing a wealth of empirical knowledge on the impact of macroeconomic issues on the families most frequently helped by social workers. New Approaches to Family Practice takes current research driven by the family systems theoretical framework and applies it to direct practice with families in three specific areas: paid work and family-work, unemployment, and poverty. To illustrate the links from research to practice, the book presents chapters on the theory and research in each of the three target areas, each followed by a chapter on application and tools for direct practice in that area. Individual chapters include case studies, assessment tools, multilevel interventions and evaluations, and strategies for social change.	1996-10-11	Sage Publications						ZZZ000000
9780803943742	The nature of nurture	Theodore D. Wachs		Current knowledge about the nature of environmental influences upon children's development is synthesized in this volume.Wachs explores such issues as individual differences in response to stress, medical treatment, parenting styles and teaching approaches, and examines such questions as whether there are certain periods in children's development when they may be more sensitive to specific environmental influences than at other times, and whether girls are more sensitive than boys to parental maltreatment.	1992	Sage Publications						ZZZ000000
9780803943759	The nature of nurture	Theodore D. Wachs		Are there certain periods in a child's development when he or she may be more sensitive to specific environmental influences than at earlier or later times? Are preschool teachers equally nurturant to securely attached versus insecurely attached children? Are girls more sensitive than boys to parental maltreatment? Designed to synthesize what we know about the nature of environmental influences (nurture) upon development, Wachs artfully explores whether development depends upon a sole factor--the rearing environment, genetics, nutrition, or individual characteristics-- or, whether the degree of directional consistency combined with the extent of covariance among these factors may have the most developmental impact. Issues such as how individuals respond differently to stress, medical treatment, parenting styles, teaching approaches and daycare centers are all discussed through careful analysis of research and theories from a variety of fields. Researchers, teachers, and intervention specialists of developmental psychology, family studies, social psychology, education, and nursing will find The Nature of Nurture an inspiration to further examine how environmental systems determine variability in developmental outcomes and what can be done to promote optimal outcomes for individual children. USE IN NEXT AD (2/1/94): "In The Nature of Nurture Wachs does precisely what he intends to do. He lays out clearly and thoroughly what we know and do not know about environmental influences on human development, and he builds on the conceptual and empirical work of others to move research on environmental effects forward in productive and exciting ways. . . . [It] should serve as a bible for future research on the environment and development. As such, it is a must read for developmental psychologists from all specialty areas, to graduate students, and to upper level undergraduates. This is an eminently readable and important book." --Contemporary Psychology "The Nature of Nurture provides a thorough and thoughtful review and analysis of state-of-the-art theory, concepts, and evidence pertaining to the effect of the environment on human development. Especially important is the attention the author pays to the multidimensional nature of the environment, to individual differences among children, and to the need to consider both of these domains of complexity for understanding the development of specific aspects of psychological and behavioral functioning." --Jay Belsky, The Pennsylvania State University "The Nature of Nurture provides extended treatments of issues rarely dealt with in detail, including organism-environment covariance and organism-environment interaction. All in all, this is an excellent choice for those interested in studying complex, dynamic interplay of organism and environment. It deals with a number of critical design and theory issues; and it ends with a hybrid ecological developmental model designed to integrate studies of experience and offers a useful discussion of future trends in an emerging area of developmental studies." --Child Development Abstracts & Bibliography	1992	Sage Publications						ZZZ000000

9780803933989	Feminism and sociological theory	Ruth A. Wallace		Prior to the late 1960's, sociological theory was surrounded by an overwhelming preponderance of men--in terms of published writings, university professors, graduate students, professional organizations, and in research centers. The contemporary women's movement of the late 1960's challenged this trend by asking questions such as: Why shouldn't there be more women professors, graduate students, researchers, and theorists? Since this time, professional organizations have seen a dramatic increase in women memberships, but the number of women in leadership roles has been disappointing. It is not surprising that feminist concerns have suffered from this kind of benign neglect. This volume is an attempt to reverse the trend and to make feminist concerns a top priority in sociological theory. The aims of this volume are: to bring theoretical efforts of feminist scholarship into the mainstream, to illuminate the directions of theoretical work currently in progress, and to encourage more thinking and writing about feminist implications in sociological theory. Contributing to this volume are some of the leading figures in feminist research--Jessie Bernard, Rose L. Coser, and Joan Acker. It should be of interest to feminist scholars, as well as students and professionals in the areas of sociology, political science, social theory, and gender studies. "Smith, Acker, and others are leading figures within the feminine discourse."	1989	Sage Publications						ZZZ000000

9780803997523	Capital and labour in the urbanized world	John Walton&International Sociological Association		The distribution of capital and labour in the contemporary world is undergoing a radical change. Traditional industries in the West are in decline while in the third world cheap, plentiful labour is available and increasingly attractive. This book analyzes the implications of this situation for both developed and less developed nations. It examines the impact such a shift of resources will have on the rich Western nations that dominate the international system. Also it describes the likely domestic consequences for countries which have to reconcile the clashing interests of domestic capital and labour and to attract vital foreign industry and investment. The book concentrates on the theoretical, political and national issues involved. It examines the friction that is created by the divergent interests of competitive regions and countries. Special attention is given to the dangers inherent in an economic system that allows rival states to move capital and labour freely throughout the world. Among the topics discussed are the dramatic urbanization of the Arab Middle East following the oil boom, the problems of unequal regional development, internal migration and urban planning in the third world, and the plight of the middle classes of Latin America who are faced by the expansion of modern state economies and the intervention of international capital.	1985	Sage Publications						ZZZ000000

The book suggests that the primary reason such programmes have been largely unsuccessful is that they have not been properly coordinated.  Making a Difference for Students at Risk offers thoughtful, practical suggestions for new approaches aimed at not only reforming, but transforming, urban schools in order to achieve the inclusion of all students into general school programmes.	1995	Corwin Press						ZZZ000000

9780803932777	Altered states of consciousness and mental health,a cross-cultural perspective	Colleen A. Ward		Demonic possession, multiple personalities, spirit possession, self-healing, and exorcism--the psychological study of such phenomena has long been fraught with difficulties. A strong behavioristic approach in the discipline has resulted in a reluctance to examine internal, intangible, inaccessible mental states that are not readily amenable to experimental investigation. In Altered States of Consciousness and Mental Health, a distinguished group of contributors explores these and other phenomena from a cross-cultural perspective. They dispell common misconceptions, clarify terms, and resolve controversies surrounding the relationships between consciousness and psychological well-being. Historical, biological, psychological, and methodological factors are considered from a variety of cultural contexts. In addition, contributors provide fascinating case studies and interviews for each of the phenomena discussed. This ground-breaking study will be of particular interest to cross-cultural psychologists, anthropologists, sociologists, ethnopsychiatrists, and mental health professionals who find themselves coming into increasing contact with these phenomena. "It is an important contribution to cross-cultural understanding of human thinking. . . . I would recommend it strongly to all psychologists and psychiatrists interested in trying to widen the perspectives of their basically Eurocentric disciplines." --British Journal of Psychiatry "An interesting and thought-provoking collection of papers in this emerging field which deserves to become a standard text in the years ahead." --Clinical Psychology Europe "What the book does is to open discussion and pave the way for more and better investigations of the phenomena of altered states of consciousness and their relation to mental health." --New Zealand Journal of Psychology	1989-10	SAGE Publications						ZZZ000000

Tony Waters uses data from 100 years of United States immigration records to examine immigrant groups such as Laotians, Koreans and Mexicans in the late 20th century, as well as Mexicans and Molkan Russians in the early years of the century. The study reveals the sequential consequences of a high proportion of young males in an immigrant group: patterned misunderstanding between parents and children; deviant subcultures such as gangs; structural rather than cultural differences with the host community. Tony Waters also devotes a large part of this study to show where and why crime does not develop on account of a large presence of immigrant youth.	1999-03-31	Sage Publications						ZZZ000000

This volume examines these processes within the communications field as a whole, from interpersonal to mass communication, and thereby brings to light many largely unexplored connections. The first part focuses on the methodological and theoretical significance of communication events or states which vary regularly, or in some distinct pattern, over time. The second section is a compilation of current theories and research based on the ideas of cyclic and dynamic patterns which occur in diverse communication settings.	1996-05-21	Sage Publications						ZZZ000000

9780803951723	Group treatment for adult survivors of abuse,a manual for practitioners	Laura Pistone Webb&James Leehan		"This is a superbly practical book about group treatment for adults who suffered childhood trauma. It reminds us that physical abuse and sexual abuse both involve the betrayal of innocence by caregivers, an innocence that is the right of every child." --Tom Roesler, M.D., National Jewish Center for Immunology and Respiratory Medicine "A model such as the one described in this book is very much needed in this day and age. . . . From my perspective, this book's most substantive contribution is in the articulation of the advantages and complications of group treatment for this specialized population and strategies for management and containment. Group leaders need guidelines and information that are not taught in standard curricula and not widely available otherwise. . . . This book offers group leaders valuable insight into the functioning and utility of such a group model." --from the Foreword by Christine A. Courtois Providing a holistic, practical approach, Group Treatment for Adult Survivors of Abuse addresses the long-term effects of child abuse and provides a tested model for treatment. This new model assists survivors with neutralizing, even reversing, the effects of early abuse trauma. Authors Laura Pistone Webb and James Leehan skillfully use case studies to demonstrate the relationship between the abuse experience; the cumulative, debilitating and long-term effects that hinder personal maturation; and the value of accessible group therapy in conjunction with an individual treatment program. This valuable volume discusses the advantages and complications of group treatment for this special population and offers strategies for management and containment. The authors validate the overlap that frequently occurs in patterns of abuse and stress the need to be encompassing rather than restrictive in treatment approach.

9780803973428	Political tolerance,balancing community and diversity	Robert Weissberg		At first glance, the virtues of tolerance seem absolutely unassailable. Yet, in this increasingly charged climate, qualified behavioral tolerance seems to have been replaced by a blank-check attitudinal tolerance that threatens individual liberty and stifles free speech. This argument is at the center of this compelling new volume in the Contemporary American Politics series. Author Robert Weissberg takes a serious look at the political shifts over the past 30 years and their effect on our attitudes and our behavior. Political Tolerance shines a light on questions that are often obscured or ignored: What should be tolerated? Is being highly tolerant always a praiseworthy virtue? Is the welcoming of differences too often merely a way to escape being labeled intolerant? This book provides a serious, scholarly introduction to notions of tolerance over time and considers many of the most controversial topics of modern time in an unblinking and thoughtful manner. Political Tolerance is a must-read for scholars and students in a wide range of courses in political thought and political science.	1998	Sage Publications						ZZZ000000

Has regulation in the United States gone too far? Marcia Whicker explores U.S. economic policy, drawing attention to the critical role played by political philosophy, political institutions, the cultural climate, and popular reaction to ever-changing economic conditions. Whicker examines the debates of U.S. economic policy--the proper size of government, the government's role in managing the economy, and the role the government should play in economic growth and in aiding the economically disadvantaged. She describes long-term economic and political cycles, such as the Kondratieff cycle, that appear to stymie government in its efforts to maintain a stable economy. Other issues discussed include tradeoffs between market versus government control of the economy, debates over a supply-side versus demand-side economic policy, deficit spending, taxation, controversies surrounding the savings and loan scandals of the 1990s, and the impact of living in a globalized economy. This is a comprehensive picture of the problems, issues, and debates that surround economic policy in the U.S. in the 1990s; it places in a political context the pros and cons of governmental efforts to deal with reality, rhetoric, and theory.	1993	Sage Publications						ZZZ000000

9780761903659	Hearing the internal trauma,working with children and adolescents who have been sexually abused	Sandra Wieland		Hearing the Internal Trauma offers therapists an innovative clinical model for understanding what happens within a sexually abused child. Combining the latest research findings in child development, early attachment, sexual abuse, and trauma with extensive clinical experience, this clearly written book assists therapists in not only recognizing signs of a child or adolescent's abuse but also developing effective therapeutic interventions. Author Sandra Wieland first provides a clear description of how children and adolescents present themselves in therapy, identifying how distress from abuse can be exhibited in their play, conversation, and behavior. Then, using a carefully balanced combination of psychoanalytic, behavioral, and cognitive therapies, Wieland imparts a psychodynamic trauma-focused therapy designed especially for abused children and adolescents. Including illustrative case examples of play or conversation as well as the therapist's thought processes, the book describes therapy with children, adolescents, and their nonperpetrator or perpetrator parents. Also included is a thoughtful discussion of the effects a therapist's own experiences and internalizations can have on the therapy process. Easy to read yet thought-provoking, Hearing the Internal Trauma is ideal for therapists, social workers, mental health practitioners, and interns working with this client population. Advanced students will also find the book instructional and enlightening.	1997	Sage Publications						ZZZ000000

Best		Using extensive data collected in 14 countries, Sex and Psyche offers a comprehensive examination of important gender-related concepts in a cross-cultural perspective. Written as a sequel to their first volume, Measuring Sex Stereotypes, Williams and Best extend their research with the Adjective Check List to include multicultural perspectives on sex role stereotypes and the self-concepts of young adults. Specifically, their self-concepts are examined with reference to such factors as their relative strengths, activities, and favorability. Also added to their methodology is the Sex Role Ideology Scale. With this tool, the authors analyze men's and women's sex role ideologies--considering both the more traditional male-dominated perspectives to the more contemporary egalitarian perspectives. The findings concerning sex role ideology are timely and important in documenting the differences in sex role expectations which in turn are related to differences in socio-economic development among countries. Both the existence of universals as well as cross-cultural variations are presented along with the authors' empirical findings. Both Sex and Psyche and its revised sequel are so closely linked that researchers will want to acquire them as a package. Anyone interested in the fields of gender studies, psychology, cross-cultural studies, family studies, and sociology will not want to pass up these essential resources. "Sex and Psyche examines perceptions of the real and ideal self as they relate to sex-role ideology. . . . These volumes [Sex and Psyche, Measuring Sex Stereotypes] serve as an important part of our understanding of gender stereotypes and of what members of many nations have to say about themselves and others." --Contemporary Psychology "Williams and Best's methodology is presented in detail, references are complete, and data are given in an appendix for readers wishing to study them.

9780803953345	The indigenous voice in world politics,since time immemorial	Franke Wilmer		Indigenous peoples represent the unfinished business of decolonization. In this fascinating volume, Franke Wilmer examines how indigenous activists are cultivating international support for a program of self-determination and legal protection, as well as how "the indigenous voice in world politics" is transforming civic discourse within the international community. With the United Nations designation for 1993 as the "Year of Indigenous Peoples," this book could not be more timely in its subject matter or in its scale of coverage. The Indigenous Voice in World Politics will serve as a benchmark text for students in ethnic studies, political science, development studies, sociology, and international relations. "The topic area that Dr. Wilmer has defined is a vital one that will appeal to a broad and growing audience. It is not only of great importance and interest morally and politically, but (in Wilmer's hands) of great significance intellectually. Indeed, Wilmer's ability to combine the moral/political with the intellectual/theoretical is exceptional, and a great source of this project's originality and power. This book will find readers among human rights activists, ethnologists, sociologists, cultural anthropologists, students of international relations, and laypersons interested in indigenous peoples, especially American Indians. This is an impressive project." --Richard H. Brown, University of Maryland at College Park "This is one of the few times anyone from the political science discipline has taken a very good cross view of what has transpired in indigenous cultures." --Ron LaFrance, American Indian Program, Cornell University "The Indigenous Voice in World Politics stands as a benchmark text for use in both undergraduate and graduate courses emphasizing or including consideration of the international status of indigenous peoples." --Ward Churchill, American Indian Studies, University of Colorado at Boulder "While Wilmer's analysis of the legal and philosophical debate on the status of indigenous peoples draws heavily on the U. S. experience, specific examples of the fate of these communities are drawn from all around the globe.

The Study responds to enormous public concern about the harmful effects of television on society. In 1993, Senator Paul Simon of Illinois issues a challenge to the television industry to voluntarily pursue an independent assessment of violence on television. In 1994, the cable television industry accepted Simon's challenge by commissioning a prestigious group of media effects researchers from four major universities to conduct a three-year study of TV violence. The project includes an oversight council of representatives from 18 leading public health, legal, medical, research, and entertainment industry policy organizations. Based on the largest and most representative sample of television content ever evaluated by a single scientific study, National Television Violence Study, Volume 2 offers a commentary on the state of violence on American television for viewers, policymakers, the media industry, and media scholars. It analyzes the content of television programming with a special focus on the nature and context of violent portrayals and their likely effect on audiences. It considers such factors as whether the violence is rewarded or punished; whether the portrayal includes the consequences of violence; the realism, extent, and graphicness of the violence; use of weapons; and the involvement of humor. The study includes: + A content analysis of violence in television drama and comedy series, movies, children's shows, and music videos + Research on violence in reality programs, including "talk about violence" in nonfiction shows such as tabloid news, police shows, documentaries, and talk shows + Studies of how program ratings and advisories are used on television and the role they play in the viewing decisions of children + Profiles of potential target audiences for future antiviolence campaigns and a content analysis of current anti-violence public service announcements This second year annual report presents comparative year-to-year data on the nature and extent of violence on television across program genres and channel types. It contributes new data on the effectiveness of various kinds of violence ratings and advisories for children and young adolescent audiences. It also presents a fresh analysis of a national survey of adolescents that sheds light on the most appropriate audiences for anti-violence public service announcements. Finally, it provides novel analyses of "high risk" presentations of violence most likely to adversely affect younger audiences. This groundbreaking report will be of great value to students and researchers in media studies, popular culture, sociology, communication, and violence prevention.	1997-05-08	Sage Publications						ZZZ000000

Here, she uses that information to provide a fascinating insight into the feelings and views of those young people who are hard to motivate. What we learn from her work is that we might not like what we hear, we might not agree with what we hear, but, if we are to include these young people in our schools, then we must listen to them.  This book very cleverly combines the academic study with a practical, accessible format. Margin summaries allow the browser to find relevant material. Most importantly, the book provides teachers with suggestions on how to better provide for the pupils who are hard to reach and hard to teach.	2000-01-01	Lucky Duck Publishing						ZZZ000000
9780761950981	Gender and discourse	Ruth Wodak		The contributors to this collection offer an essential introduction to the ways in which feminist linguistics and critical discourse analysts have contributed to our understanding of gender and sex. By examining how these perspectives have been applied to these concepts, the contributors provide both a review of the literature, as well as an opportunity to follow the most recent debates in this area. Through an analysis of a range of real data, they also demonstrate the relevance of these theoretical and methodological insights for gender research in particular and social practice in general. A purely theoretical first part discusses the most relevant issues about power, racism, and the gender-sex debate, while the second part focuses on gendered discourse in both the public and private domains; the workplace, as well as the family. The third and final part provides the reader with a number of studies from a more ethnographic point of view where the impact of culture on the discursive construction of gender is illustrated. This fascinating volume succeeds in bringing together European, American, and Australian traditions of research and will be essential reading for all students of linguistics, gender, and psychology.	1997	Sage Publications						ZZZ000000
9780803970304	Alternatives to violence,empowering youth to develop healthy relationships	David A. Wolfe&Christine Wekerle&Katreena Scott		Motivated by the need to stop violence against women and children, the authors of this timely volume argue that the key to preventing interpersonal violence lies in education during that "window of opportunity" -- adolescence.  The authors present a model designed to educate young people about the abuse of power and to assist them in forming egalitarian relationships. Their hope is that as healthier relationships are formed, the overall risk of violence against women and children is reduced and the foundation is laid for future, non-violent relationships.	1997	Sage Publications						ZZZ000000

9780803936836	Eating and growth disorders in infants and children	Joseph L. Woolston		Do certain eating disorders directly correlate with neglect and abuse? What do eating and growth disorders have in common? And, are some treatment methods more successful than others in treating such disorders? In Eating and Growth Disorders in Infants and Children Woolston examines the relevant literature on each major eating and growth disorder from infancy through childhood. Among the disorders considered are failure to thrive, psychosocial dwarfism, rumination, pica, obesity, and anorexia nervosa. The author describes the emergence and course of each specific disorder, discusses known or suspected risk factors, and alerts the reader to unresolved clinical and research issues. Woolston also stresses the advantages of using a multidisciplinary team approach --including a pediatrician, a nurse, a developmental psychologist, a social worker, and a nutritionist--and points out that all aspects and levels of risk should be considered. Comprehensive, yet concise, this book presents an excellent overview of the various aspects of each disorder. It is an indispensable volume for professionals and students in developmental psychology, clinical psychology, psychiatry, social work, and nursing.	1991	Sage Publications						ZZZ000000
9780761940708	Children's mathematics,making marks, making meaning	Maulfry Worthington&Elizabeth Carruthers		Drawing on their many years' experience of teaching children 3 to 8 years, the authors explain the development and range of young children's mathematical marks and representations. They show how to assess and support these early mathematical graphics. The authors believe that this is the key to success in school mathematics and to higher levels of achievement.Offering a wealth of practical guidance to support teachers of young children, the book is linked to current educational theory. It sets out ways of helping children make sense of mathematics and suggests an alternative approach to the use of worksheets. It is supported by numerous examples of children's own representations and intuitive methods. Children are then more able to translate between their informal knowledge and more abstract forms of mathematical symbolism, which they meet as they progress through school.	2003-06-02	Paul Chapman						ZZZ000000

9780761955214	Rethinking youth	Johanna Wyn&Rob White		Young people grow up in varied circumstances with different priorities and perspectives. While youth does not exist as a single group we need to understand what is happening in young people's lives. Rethinking Youth challenges the conventional wisdoms surrounding the position and opportunities of young people today and provides a systematic overview of the major perspectives in youth studies. The authors demonstrate how the concept of youth involves a tension between the social significance of age, which gives young people a common status, and the significance of other social divisions. Drawing upon studies from different societies, they examine debates surrounding youth and economy, youth development, youth subcultures, youth transitions and youth marginalisation. Rethinking Youth offers a provocative critique of mainstream conceptions of youth, the programs and strategies designed for 'at risk' young people, and policy developments in youth affairs. It calls for greater sensitivity to the complexities of youth, and greater emphasis on democracy and equality in dealing with the problems experienced by young people in a rapidly changing world.	1997-02-10	Sage						ZZZ000000

She analyzes the far-reaching effects of the cultural value given to crime, showing it to be rooted in a powerful nexus of the body, language, the community and everyday life.Imagining Crime examines a number of key events and issues which have signalled shifts in the representation of crime. These include: criminology's resistance to feminist intervention; the pleasures of reading detective fiction; ambiguities of victimization and social justice in the city; sacrificial structures in the law's response to conjugal homicide; policing the ethnicity of the `illegal' immigrant; defensive responses to the limits of representation in the Bulger affair; the governmental strategies of campaigns against single mothers; and the fatalism of the spectacle of HIV/AIDS in criminal justice policy.	1996	Sage						ZZZ000000

9780803936867	Preserving families,evaluation resources for practitioners and policymakers	Ying-Ying T. Yuan&Michele Rivest		Providing excellent insights into evaluation, Preserving Families examines the issues related to describing and evaluating social programs for families and children. The focus is on keeping the family intact, rather than those programs that emphasize removing the child from the family setting. The contributors offer an in-depth discussion of program features that are important for conducting an evaluation, including program description, target populations, client outcomes, cost analysis, and evaluation design. Each chapter raises issues that are pertinent to designing a comprehensive or a special focus study, including a detailed description of program components. Preserving Families is an essential tool for understanding policy analysis and program evaluation, and also provides practical case materials for classroom instruction. "The monograph offers a number of suggestions and illustrations for making evaluations relevant to 'real world' policymakers and program managers. . . . [It] is a great tool that will help demystify evaluation . . . [and] will help people in the family preservation field--and in related fields--feel competent in helping define and shape the evaluation agenda in ways that will produce useful and usable findings. . . . [It] provides great case material for classroom instruction in program evaluation and policy analysis." --Sandy M. O'Donnell, Roosevelt University "Offers a comprehensive assessment of evaluation resources for practitioners and policy makers.

This comprehensive 'how to,' step-by-step guide arrives at a crucial time: [meeting] a growing demand for evaluation for family preservation services. Experts in the child welfare and mental health fields have provided a pertinent and easily understood response to an urgent question: How can a design for an evaluation be produced that will provide reliable data for practitioners, administrators, and policymakers?" --Esther Wattenberg, University of Minnesota "Provides the most current information on crisis-intervention work with high-risk, multiproblem families. . . . For readers interested in program evaluation of family preservation services, the book is a must. . . . Read Preserving Families for thoughtful, practical suggestions relative to evaluating family preservation programs." --Journal of Marital and Family Therapy "The importance of accurate and available evaluation to social policy formulation is a critical issue that is often ignored because this type of research is generally lacking. Special research techniques and methods need to be considered in order to answer policy questions. This book is an important contribution to that end. The methods and techniques described by these authors are certainly applicable to other social service policy areas as well. Clearly written, this is a volume for hands-on planners and evaluators; it is not intimidating, nor is it condescending." --Family Relations	1990-04	Sage Publications						ZZZ000000

9780761950608	Identities in talk	Charles Antaki&Sue Widdicombe		Identity attracts some of social scienceÆs liveliest and most passionate debates. Theory abounds on matters as disparate as nationhood, ethnicity, gender politics, and culture. But there is much less investigation into the actual empirical details of how identity appears in the details of everyday life. This book gathers together, in a collection of chapters that draw on ethnomethodology and conversation analysis, arguments that show that identities are constructed æliveÆ in the actual exchange of talk. By closely examining tapes and transcripts of real social interactions from a wide range of situations, using ethnomethodological and conversation analytic methods, the book examines just how it is that a person can be ascribed to a category and what features about that category are consequential for the interaction. This thoughtful volume is ideal for advanced undergraduates, postgraduates, and researchers in social psychology, sociology, communication, and anthropology.	1998	SAGE Publications						ZZZ000000

Gopal Iyer&Sudhir Krishna		The fourth in a major series that examines the status of land reforms in India, Land Reforms in India, Volume 4 critically reviews the implementation of land reform legislation in the state of Karnataka. It presents the most recent data available in order to provide a holistic understanding of both the historical evolution and the current grassroots situation of land reforms in the state. Written by scholars, activists, and administrators, the chapters in this book examine a wide range of issues, including the central questions concerning the direction Karnataka should now take with regard to land reforms. The options considered include implementing the traditional concept of land reforms but with renewed vigor, maintaining the status quo and letting the existing laws continue in their own pace of implementation, or liberalizing land reform laws in line with the countryÆs new economic policies. The contributors agree that whichever policy option is adopted, political will and public awareness are the two most important factors in determining the success of future efforts at land reforms in the context of the rapidly changing socioeconomic scenario. The marked absence of jargon and irrelevant theoretical concepts imbues this volume with tremendous practical significance. It is essential reading not only for administrators, policymakers, and activists, but also for scholars in the areas of agrarian studies, political economy, development studies, peasant studies, and policy studies.	1997	Sage Publications						ZZZ000000

9780761909217	The uses and misuses of data and models,the mathematization of the human sciences	James Bradley&Kurt C. Schaefer		Undeniably, the amount of "human information" in our culture has increased by leaps and bounds. How that information is used has profound implications on the way we live as a society. At the same time, the discussion of values, norms, and purpose is often missing from the discourse of social research especially by those who work within the positivist framework. Authors James Bradley and Kurt Schaefer develop principles to guide the use of data and models in the human sciences. Writing as scholars who are at home with empirical and mathematical social science, yet taking seriously the critiques of this heritage, the authors propose ways of developing norms without becoming radically subjective. The Uses and Misuses of Data and Models argues eloquently that norms, values, and purpose need to become part of the common discourse of researchers, with more ethical and socially responsible research the result. The Uses and Misuses of Data and Models is an intriguing and thought-provoking book that will be of great interest to anyone involved in the enterprise of social research.	1998	Sage Publications						ZZZ000000
9780803937864	Applied cross-cultural psychology	Richard W. Brislin		Cross-cultural contacts are now commonplace. In schools, neighborhoods, and businesses cultural diversity is now the rule, not the exception. And, as this contact increases, it raises several important--and fundamental--questions. How valid are our self-perceptions in relation to other cultures? How receptive are we to the viewpoints of other cultures? Indeed, are differences necessarily detriments? In Applied Cross-Cultural Psychology, a distinguished international team of experts examines the many facets of the cross-cultural experience, including cross-cultural testing and assessment, the psychological effects of acculturation, the role of foreign students, industrial and organizational psychology, acculturation and emotional and physical health, and cross-cultural orientation programs. Specific methodologies and how they may be applied in different areas, the emphasis on basics rather than complex theoretical issues, and the development of current knowledge and review of concepts make this innovative book appealing to professors, undergraduate students, and practitioners alike. A must read for anyone with interests in cross-cultural comparative studies, psychology, social psychology, counseling, social work, organization studies, and sociology. "The coverage of topics in this book, in terms of breadth as well as depth, is quite impressive. In the introductory chapter, the editor, Richard Brislin, does an excellent job of drawing together the rather diverse chapters of the volume. In fact, his chapter could easily serve as a very up-to-date summary of the social-personality-clinical components of cross-cultural psychology . . . Overall, this volume represents an important early effort to outline the potential contributions of a cross-cultural orientation to the resolution of social problems. Indeed, there are remarkably few areas in "mainstream" applied psychology that are not covered in this book . . . the volume is very successful. the authors are to be commended for providing a broad look into terribly important and interesting issues in a manner that is palatable to specialist and generalist alike." --Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology "For everybody who wants to become (more) familiar with the cross-cultural psychological approach to diversity, this book will be very useful." --International Association for Intercultural Education "An extraordinarily coherent and well-edited volume of chapters that spans a very wide range of theoretical and applied models of psychology. . . . There is a chapter on cross-cultural psychology and the programmes: on international students; on family and home-based interventions; on acculturation; on the environment, culture and behaviour; and more besides. If these topics whet your appetite, then this is the volume for you." --Behaviour Research Therapy	1990	Sage Publications						ZZZ000000

She goes on to consider how such influential figures as Nietzsche, Adorno, Musil, Barthes and Lacan constitute a baroque paradigm, united by their allegorical style, their conflation of aesthetics with ethics and their subject matter - death, catastrophe, sexuality, myth, the female.

Humphrey&Karen Reinhardt		"The authors provide a rationale and practical tools for weaving continuous assessment and instruction in science into the fabric of learning. Teachers who use the methods in the book will know what and how students are learning every day and gain insights into how to best facilitate learning in their classrooms." a??From the Foreword by Susan Mundry Experience the delight and professional growth that comes from engaging deeply with your students! By combining science inquiry and continuous assessment, you will not only catalyze meaningful changes in your students' thinking and learning but also reflect on and enhance your own approach to teaching.  Inquiry science is a standards-based teaching method whereby students ask questions and find answers for themselves using scientific methods under the guidance of a teacher.  Continuous assessment is a purposeful approach to listening and observing students and using that information to understand a student's thinking and skills.  Formulating strategies and plans to support each student's intellectual growth is the next step in this circular process. Weaving Science Inquiry & Continuous Assessment explores the nature of continuous assessment in the context of science inquiry, and contains specific tools and techniques, along with stories and strategies in teachers' own words. Chapters cover the following subjects that reflect the latest information and most current teaching environment: The essence of continuous assessment The context for continuous assessment Techniques and tools for facilitating inquiry and collecting student data Analyzing and using continuous assessment data Challenges, realities, and advice Continuous assessment and professional growth By engaging in this process of inquiry and continuous assessment, both students and teachers will benefit from this fresh approach to learning, thinking, and assessment.	2003-04	Corwin Press						ZZZ000000
9780761904434	"Color-blind" racism	Leslie G. Carr		Many of the vestiges of the Civil Rights movement, including initiatives such as affirmative action, are increasingly under attack by those who assert that the Constitution is explicitly "color-blind." In this argument, the government is not legally permitted to take race into account in a "color conscious" manner. More than 30 years have passed since the landmark Civil Rights Acts became the law of the land. Yet, one of three African American men between the ages of 18 and 27 is in the hands of the criminal justice system, churches are burning in the South, and right-wing militia groups are flourishing. In this provocative and timely book, Leslie G. Carr suggests that the Constitution can be read as "racist," and that the concept of "color-blindness" is in fact the latest in a series of racist ideologies that have been part of the American fabric. "Color-Blind" Racism provides a thorough historical grounding in racist ideologies in the United States, and will be of great interest to anyone teaching or studying race relations, public policy, urban studies, and race and politics.	1997	Sage Publications						ZZZ000000

Clark		"The book provides a wealth of statistically-based evidence to substantiate or repudiate important arguments and assumptions central to the radical changes that are occurring in cities and municipal government." --Max Barlow in Journal of Economic and Social Geography More and more often, city governments operate under turbulent conditions: severe cutbacks in grants from national governments, drop in voter turnouts, taxpayer revolts, and a population of dissatisfied citizens. Urban Innovation addresses these issues by exploring how cities can innovate in the face of such challenges. Based on survey data from the Fiscal Austerity and Innovation Project, this volume reassesses theories of political leadership and government decision making, discusses the ways that cities have made innovations over the past decade, and reviews 33 specific strategies and their results. Some of the other issues this volume addresses are race and class, the growth and decline of city governments, and the intergovernmental aid cutbacks made during the Reagan administration. The turbulence of the past two decades is critical in reshaping our way of thinking about how governments work. Urban Innovation will be useful for students, faculty, and professionals in urban studies, political science, and policy studies.	1994	Sage Publications						ZZZ000000
9781853961007	Approaching human geography,an introduction to contemporary theoretical debates	Paul J. Cloke&Chris Philo&David Sadler		This introduction to the development of new theoretical approaches to human geography sets out to explain the key features of these new approaches, and to trace their antecedents and implications. The authors also highlight points of comparison and contrast, inter-connection and dissimilarity.   An introductory chapter describes and accounts for the theoretical diversity present within twentieth-century human geography, and particular attention is paid to the transition from environmental and regional approaches to the spatial science of the 1960s. This chapter then sets the stage for the later chapters, which deal systematically with different post-1960s approaches: Marxism, humanism, realism, structuration and postmodernism. Each of these chapters deals with the chronological development of the appropriate literature, describes the key claims and arguments, and then presents a worked example to illustrate the benefits and pitfalls of an approach in practice. A concluding chapter re-integrates the diverse themes and reflects briefly on possible future theoretical developments in human geography in the 1990s.

Research into the many factors that shape human health or illness, has traditionally emphasized experimental design and the statistical effects of specific factors. While due attention is paid to such methods, the contributors emphasize the importance of theory-guided, multi-method approaches for research into the complex forces affecting health, health-related behaviour and the effectiveness of health services. Throughout, the value of analytical models of population health is related to their utility in informing and	1993-11-04	Sage Publications						ZZZ000000

9780803950504	Nonresidential parenting,new vistas in family living	Charlene E. Depner&James H. Bray		With burgeoning numbers of nonresidential parents, how can policymakers and professionals who work with families address the emotional and financial needs of children who do not live with both parents? What resources exist for developing parenting agreements between mothers and fathers who live apart? What should be done when a child refuses to visit the nonresidential parent? What effect does a parent's remarriage have on children? A distinguished roster of scholars addresses these questions by drawing from research, policy, and practice sources to identify the rich array of roles that nonresidential parents may play in the lives of their children. Taking a multidimensional approach that views the family as an entity that changes over time, they also explore such issues as variation in nonresidential parenting across ethnic groups, financial implications of parenting apart, patterns of involvement of nonresidential parents, and children's adjustment to remarriage. Included in each chapter are implications for further research and social policy. This important volume concludes with a chapter that offers new directions for multidimensional approaches to research, policy and practice. Nonresidential Parenting will make compelling reading for researchers, practitioners, and students who work with or study families. "Depner and Bray's collection is especially useful in elaborating its principal contention that a 'monolithic vision of non-residential parenting is a poor basis for policy.'....the book is a competent reflection upon research in the United States." --British Journal of Social work "Consistent with its multidisciplinary approach and its focus on research and application, the book is very readable. It is unique in the ease with which it integrates research, theory, and practice. Yet the text represents a very scholarly approach to the study of these families and related interventions. Major empirical and applied scholarship from a variety of disciplines has been drawn upon to support the book's conclusions and recommendations. This book will be an invaluable resource." --Family Relations	1993-02-04	Sage						ZZZ000000

Confronting practical realities, this compelling volume focuses on how such issues as limited opportunity, restraints on freedom, compulsions of coercive family norms, responsibilities, poverty, bigotry, gender, physical separation, and limited geographic mobility influence personal relationships. Because the contributors successfully argue for the redirection of research--from the over-application of an individual perspective to the inclusion of contextual features--students and scholars in social psychology, communication studies, family studies, sociology, and gender studies will discover much of value in this fascinating volume.	1993	Sage Publications						ZZZ000000

However, this volume marks a departure for the conference by reflecting a new collaboration between Manchester Business School and the University of Twente at Enschede in The Netherlands. In the future the conference will alternate between Enschede and Manchester. The papers included in this volume represent the best papers presented at the first conference to be held at the University of Twente in September 1996.The broad intention in initiating this international collaboration was to increase the number of contributions to this conference from continental Europe, and this has certainly been achieved in the current volume, with inputs from Sweden, The Netherlands, Germany, Portugal, Denmark, Finland and France, together with the usual strong United Kingdom contribution. The call for papers that engendered this fourth conference had a specific theme of entrepreneurial activity and the co-operation process, with particular concern for networking. In keeping with the goal of previous books in this series, this set of papers adds to a growing body of evolving specialist literature on high technology small firms.	1998	Paul Chapman						ZZZ000000

Kaplan, Texas A&M University Can the mentally ill be interviewed? What kind of reliability can be expected in their responses? What about the ethics of informed consent? Although standard social science methodologies have been used successfully to study mental health, researching the mentally ill introduces unique theoretical and methodological issues. A first of its kind, Researching Persons with Mental Illness focuses on the study of mentally ill adults at the individual level of analysis and explores significant issues: how theories of human behavior that have been developed for a general population may have limited applicability in a population whose defining characteristic is a label of mental pathology; how symptoms are defined and measured; ways to plan and implement research to avoid methodological design problems; uses of alternative data sources, such as clinical charts; and the issues of research in multi-disciplinary settings. Designed for social scientists, this pathbreaking volume will alert researchers in ways to deal with the special problems in researching the mentally ill.	1992	Sage Publications						ZZZ000000

Science activities relating to the children's school environment are described and explained. The interaction or `encounter' of children with the environment is the pervading theme. In these `encounters' children are encouraged to find answers to their questions through scientific investigation of the objects, events or particular part of the environment being studied, either in the field or in the classroom.	1990-06-28	SAGE						ZZZ000000

The book first explains the traditional approaches to argument - the enthymeme, evidence, Toulmian, Rogerian and classical rhetoric - and illustrates why they are of particular relevance today. The contributors then `redefine' argument by connecting it with theoretical movements that have been adverse to it - feminism, narratology and reflexive reading. As a result, the book unites apparently conflicting approaches into a new definition of argument that emphasizes inquiry over discord and understanding over entrenched difference	1996	Sage Publications						ZZZ000000

9780761951582	Witness and vision of the therapists	Colin Feltham		Witness and Vision of the Therapists is a fascinating and timely book presenting the views of experienced therapists and counselors on what is learned about aspects of human nature from the many hours spent witnessing clients' stories. Contributors write about their observations on working with people whose suffering is associated with social marginalization, family breakdown, the gay community, the AIDS epidemic, the Holocaust, and with people in groups, those who have experienced disaster and personal trauma, or depression, and those who have murdered. Witness and Vision of the Therapists takes us to some of the depths of human suffering in order to illustrate the value and impact of therapy as well as some of the failings and disillusionment of therapy. The material provides insights and hypothesis bearing on the human condition itself, and the contributors do not avoid disclosing some of their own struggles, doubts, and suffering. This book yields rich views on connections between the private one-to-one world that therapists and their clients inhabit, and some of the social, political, and spiritual implications and visions arising from it.

The title of the book accurately reflects the approach taken. This is not simply a primer on how to use SPSS, but is a very good statistics text using SPSS as a vehicle for illustrating and expanding on the statistical content of the book. At the same time it also serves as a manual for SPSS, and has taught me things that I had not known about the software. I find this flexible approach to the blending of content and software to be an effective way of teaching the material. It is impossible to review this book without commenting on Andy's particular style. I enjoyed it immensely and think that it would appeal to both students and their instructors.

9780761973393	Interviewing	Nigel Fielding		Interviewing has strong claims to be the `queen' of research methods. It is used throughout the social sciences and is a core method. The ubiquity of this basic activity means that it should be no surprise that interviewing takes many forms and poses many challenges. These have been the subject of one of the most developed bodies of methodological literature having ramifications throughout the social sciences.   Commentaries on interviewing began to emerge at the very birth of the social and behavioural sciences in the 19th century. There are now hundreds of articles on the subject.  The aim of this collection is to bring together all of the key articles on interviewing which have been published in professional journals. It addresses the philosophy of interview methods and its epistemological foundations; the ethics of interview research; and the criteria for assessing interview based research. It covers both interviewing in quantitative research, such as the survey method, and qualitative research in all its many forms. The collection explores the principal types of interview (standardized, semi-standardized and non-standardized), and the different modes of interviewing (for example, telephone interviewing, life history interviews and focus groups).  There is a section on formulating interview questions, a section on the practicalities of recording, transcribing and managing interview data, and several sections addressing power relations, the role of gender, interviewing on sensitive topics and interviewing special respondents such as elites, children and the vulnerable.	2003-02-24	SAGE						ZZZ000000
9780761968634	Erving Goffman	Gary Alan Fine&Gregory W. H. Smith		Erving Goffman (1922-82) was an inspirational thinker, and one of the giants of 20th century sociology. Several of his books, notably The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life (1959), Asylums (1961), Relations in Public (1963), Stigma (1963) and Gender Advertisements (1979) are acknowledged as modern classics. Goffman fundamentally revised how we think of social life. After him, the study of social encounters, behavior in public, the construction and deconstruction of the self, stigma and forms of everyday communication, were never the same again. Without being obviously attached to any discrete research tradition, Goffman drew from the best thought on social interaction, applied it in his fieldwork, and produced a richly satisfying and extraordinary influential approach to making sense of social life. He was a sociological virtuoso, producing unmatched insights into how life with others is sustained and why forms of interaction break down or cause personal damage. This unparalleled collection, edited by two acknowledged international experts on Erving Goffman, produces a unique reference resource for researchers and students. It consists of the main critical responses to Goffman's oeuvre, offering readers a distillation of the main themes in Goffman's work and explaining how these themes relate to contemporary social thought. The collection is systematic and constitutes a unique asset in understanding this searching and wide-ranging thinker. The four volumes are thematically organized into nine sections: Section 1: Personal Reminiscences Goffman became internationally famous during the 1960s and 70s, at a moment when American sociology was growing by leaps and bounds. Although in some ways, an unusually reticent man, Goffman's success made him one of the 'faces' of American sociology during these crucial years in the professional formation of the subject. Because Goffman's methods of analysis are so personal to the man himself, this section is a particularly useful guide to elucidating and applying Goffman's ideas. Section 2: Biography and Career In this section Goffman's career is systematically and critically presented. Included are reflections on Goffman's relation to the academic community, his central legacies and his highly daring and revisionist attempt to rethink social encounters and social life. Section 3: Goffman's Sociology & Modern Society Although Goffman produced one of the most significant and influential of all contemporary approaches to sociology, the application of his ideas to the central questions of the day is often hard to identify. He was never an overtly 'political' thinker, nor did he engage in utopian theorizing. In this section, the relevance of Goffman's ideas for understanding modern society is pinpointed. Included are considerations of his dramaturgical method, his place in the politics of 60s Sociology, the relation of his ideas to questions of civility and etiquette and a discussion of how Goffman viewed human nature. Section 4: Methods Towards the end of his life Goffman sought to externalize the main methodological themes in his work. These had been mainly implicit in his popular writings in the late 1950s and 60s. However, in books like Forms of Talk (1981) and Frame Analysis (1986) he began to be more concrete about the key methodological elements in his work. This section includes discussions of Goffman's use of the concept of self, outlines the distinctive features of his method and indicates how his thought relates to 'common sense'.

9780803971400	The first helping interview,engaging the client and building trust	Sara Fine&Paul H. Glasser		Providing a practical handbook for practitioners in the helping professions, The First Helping Interview is a highly useful, easy-to-understand guide for both experienced and novice practitioners that reveals the steps involved in the crucial first meeting with a client. The authors approach the task of an initial interview by providing an overview of what the therapeutic process is and what to expect from clients, both those who seek help voluntarily and those who are required to get help. The book also covers the practical basics of therapy--counselor/client roles, physical settings, communication dynamics, assessment and diagnosis, record keeping, goals and contracts, and trust building. Separate chapters discuss special topics such as working with couples and families, the role of culture and ethnicity, when and how to refer clients with serious problems, and legal and ethical issues. Although this book is general enough to be used by any practitioner, the authors pay particular attention to specific settings, such as child protective services, crisis intervention, and corrections. Social workers, marriage and family therapists, school counselors, psychiatric nurses, child welfare workers, and probation officers will appreciate this valuable, indispensable reference tool.	1996	Sage Publications						ZZZ000000

He expounds the theory, which synthesizes psychodynamic and existential approaches, behind his technique. He demonstrates how the therapy helps clients reveal these voices quickly, recognize their source and begin to take a path to a meaningful life.	1997	Sage Publications						ZZZ000000

9780761902386	Gender dynamics in congressional elections	Richard Logan Fox		What happens in an electoral environment involving female candidates? Do women face different challenges during the electoral process? How do gender dynamics alter the conventional norms of electoral politics? Do women campaign differently from men? Do male candidates pay more attention to women's issues, or make other strategic and behavioral changes when opposed by a female candidate? Author Richard Logan Fox answers these questions and many others with compelling evidence that suggests that women candidates are having a profound impact on the electoral process. In Gender Dynamics in Congressional Elections, Fox studies the congressional races of 1992 and 1994 in California in which a record 19 women were candidates for House seats. He contrasts the experiences of both the male and female candidates and sheds new light on the different challenges women face during political campaigns. Providing a groundbreaking examination of an understudied topic, Gender Dynamics in Congressional Elections will be essential for students and professionals in political science.	1997	Sage Publications						ZZZ000000

9780803952836	Early childbearing,perspectives of Black adolescents on pregnancy, abortion, and contraception	Ellen W. Freeman&Karl Rickels		Is there a correlation between a teenager's education and occupational goals and their attitudes toward pregnancy, abortion and childbearing? What about choosing abortion over delivery? Does one's family background significantly contribute to their decision? Does family involvement prevent early teenage childbearing? Based on a study of African-American teenagers from disadvantaged backgrounds living in poor urban areas, this volume unravels a startling number of issues surrounding adolescent pregnancy, abortion, and childbearing. The authors show why these adolescents often wait until after their first sexual encounter to obtain contraception, and reveal the correlation between family involvement and the pregnancy or no-pregnancy decision. They also compare teenagers who terminated their first pregnancy with those who delivered babies. How were their educational and occupational goals affected? What about their economic status and their chances for subsequent pregnancy? This sensitive presentation makes an unmistakable contribution to the continuing problem of teenage pregnancy. It also brings us one step closer to making the changes necessary for improved methods of education, prevention, and advocacy. Early Childbearing affords the reader excellent insight into the complexities of the pregnancy problem. It also offers encouragement for educators, health care and social service professionals to assist teenagers and their families in improving their health and well-being. "Freeman and Rickels contribute with a very clear and concise discussion of the connections between psychological and structural factors. Attention is given to many issues. . . . Freeman and Rickels have written a very readable text and coherently present their research findings in both written and tabular form. The concluding chapter offers a great deal more than a summary of the book's content. . . . The conclusions drawn by the authors are insightful and intuitive, as are the authors' recommendations. Early Childbearing is loaded with useful information, and the bibliography is extensive and provides readers with abundant resources.

The second, of the alchemic wedding, highlights a plurality of cultural models of femaleness and of women/work relationships, and processes of dynamic difference, transformation and transcendence.Gherardi continues her examination of the construction of gender relations in the workplace through a series of rich and illuminating stories which also draw on various symbolic archetypes as powerful forms of cultural expression. The final section of the book looks at possibilities for change, developing in particular a concept of different forms of gender citizenship of organizations.	1995-11-13	SAGE						ZZZ000000

Cardarelli		When a child has been sexually abused, where should a parent or guardian turn for treatment? What legal issues are involved when sexual abuse occurs? What impact does child sexual abuse have on family functioning? These are questions all parents, guardians, or counselors encounter during the initial stages of child sexual abuse.

9780761930488	Cultures and societies in a changing world	Wendy Griswold		From sectarians in Bombay to gang members flashing their signs in Chicago to nationalists in Northern Ireland, in today's world, culture can inflame such intense passions that people are often willing to die for their symbols and beliefs. Culture is such an important and personal aspect of defining one's self. It develops a person's norms, values, beliefs, and practices--essentially, it influences who they are as an individual and how they are perceived by society. In the Second Edition of Cultures and Societies in a Changing World, author Wendy Griswold offers a unique sociological perspective on the role culture plays in shaping our social world. By exposing readers to the effects of cultural misunderstandings, cultural conflicts, and cultural ignorance, this book enables students to develop a true appreciation of culture and society in a world that is changing at an accelerating pace.Key FeaturesExamines a variety of common influences between cultures and societies using a "cultural diamond" design that considers the connections among the social world, cultural creators, cultural objects, and cultural audiences; Provides examples of cultural phenomena and processes from a variety of countries and periods; Allows for a greater understanding of cultural conflicts that have taken place in the post-Cold War era; Explores the effect of September 11, 2001, on cultures and societies around the globe.

9780803946323	Out of control,family therapy and domestic disorder	Jaber F. Gubrium		In a unique comparative ethnography of two family therapy programs, Gubrium deftly shows how differing organizational perceptions make visible the social construction of domestic disorder. Contrasting images of home life--one viewing domestic order as a system of authority, the other as a configuration of emotional bonds--serve to highlight different senses of the family as being out of control and to recommend alternate forms of intervention. The idea that the reality of home life and domestic troubles are embedded in organizational activities and institutional images is an important commentary on the understanding of domestic life and the postmodern family. Out of Control provides stimulating reading for professionals and students in clinical psychology, family therapy, family studies, sociology, and qualitative methods.	1992	Sage Publications						ZZZ000000

9780803958784	Substance misuse in adolescence	Thomas P. Gullotta&Gerald R. Adams&Raymond Montemayor		"This seems to be a very useful book. It is a collection of review essays on specific, relevant topics in adolescent substance misuse, rather than the usual assortment of empirical reports that belong properly in journals. It is appropriately cross-disciplinary. Each chapter ends with a clear and concise summary. The problem has generated a rich and complex research literature, one that merits a coherent and comprehensive overview. Some of the chapters in this book contain useful reviews and interesting insights." --Stan Sadava in Addiction What factors contribute to the misuse of drugs and alcohol among teens? Does one's economic background or ethnicity play a role in their avoidance or involvement in substance misuse? Substance Misuse in Adolescence explores these questions and untangles widely held beliefs about substance abuse issues using historical, clinical, and research data. This volume begins with an introduction to the social history of tobacco, alcohol, marijuana, cocaine, and heroin and then examines individual, family, peer, and community variables that may contribute to substance misuse as well as resiliency factors that enable some teens to avoid such problems. It also discusses substance misuse in rural and urban settings, the pharmacological effects of specific substances, and current treatment approaches for substance-misusing youth. It also includes coverage of drug legalization issues and a lucid discussion of the current effectiveness of various prevention programs. Researchers, graduate students, and practitioners who want the latest synthesis and view on adolescent substance misuse will find this volume a useful addition to their libraries and classrooms.	1994-10-13	Sage Publications						ZZZ000000

Moreno, the founder of sociodrama and sociometry, is best known for the impact he had on group psychotherapy, out of which he created psychodrama. This is now one of the most important and popular of the 'creative' therapies, and is widely practised throughout the world.

Paul Hare and June Rabson Hare describe a man who was, among other things, a psychiatrist, dramatist, theologian, inventor and educator, and who made significant contributions in all of these areas in addition to his major influence on social science and group psychotherapy.

Professionals can enhance both competencies by reading the Handbook of Public Affairs"- Brian Hawkinson, Director Center for Public Affairs Management/Public Affairs Council Washington "Understanding the imperatives of stakeholders and special interest groups in the public domain is of increasing importance to leaders in both business and politics.

Public affairs professionals not only understand these dynamics, but constantly strive to ensure continuous improvement in the counsel they provide and in the results they deliver.

It is best seen alongside the supervisor, as a guide, through the multidimensional sea of academic literature' - British Educational Research Journal`I have been waiting for this book for five years. It sets out a number of important dimensions involved in the process of literature review and by clear signposting, diagrams, and examples will help the student to carry out her or his review more systematically.

Hogler		Employment is closely connected to wealth, status, and security and is therefore a subject of interest across a range of academic disciplines. Employment Relations in the United States incorporates a wealth of research material from these different specialties to provide a historical perspective on the American workplace and the evolution of legal policies affecting employment. The analysis follows both a chronological and thematic arrangement, beginning with the importance of management practices, the growth of labor organizations and the impact of collective bargaining on employment institutions, and the subsequent rise of individual employment rights enforced through administrative and judicial means. Through its evolutionary approach, the book explains the fragmented, overlapping, and conceptually confusing regulatory environment governing workplace relations. It offers an integrated approach to such important contemporary policy issues as health care coverage, pensions, and effective dispute procedures. The book provides an analytical framework for an understanding of the unique nature of our labor markets and the role of government, employers, and unions.   Key Features     Provides students with the historical background they need to understand how the U.S. system developed and how it differs from systems in other industrialized nations  Discusses individual employment rights, including protection from discrimination  Covers current policy issues in employment, including raising the minimum wage, the growth of a contingent workforce, and privatizing retirement  Offers a unique historical and evolutionary explanation of the nature of employment relations   As a general overview of contemporary employment relations, Employment Relations in the United States is a perfect supplement to college courses in employment law, human resource management, and collective bargaining.

This will be required reading for students in international political theory, and indeed anyone interested in normative issues in international relations' - Chris Brown, London School of Economics and Political Science  Providing an invaluable overview of the competing schools of thought in traditional and contemporary international theory, this book seeks to path the way forward for new ways of thinking about international political morality.  First, the role and place of normative theory in the study of international politics is explained before a discussion of mainstream approaches within international relations and applied ethics. Here the student is introduced to the central debates between realists and idealists, and cosmopolitans and communitarians.  Second, the conceptual challenges of contemporary approaches in critical theory, postmodernism and feminism are outlined and then used as a platform to develop the author's own Hegelian-Foucauldian approach for doing normative international theory.  Third, the insights drawn from each approach are applied to the study of two key topics in contemporary theoretical debate: the right to self-determination, and the idea of cosmopolitan democracy, and conclusions drawn for transcending the theoretical deadlock in international relations.   Accessibly written and wide-ranging, this text will quickly become essential reading for all students and academics of politics and international relations seeking a deeper understanding of the underlying tensions and future potential of international theory today.	1999	SAGE Publications						ZZZ000000

9781853962738	Disability and the city,international perspectives	Rob Imrie		People with disabilities are one of the poorest groups in Western societies. In particular, they lack power, education and opportunities. For most disabled people, their daily reality is dependence on a carer, while trying to survive on state welfare payments. The dominant societal stereotype of disability as a ‘pitiful' state reinforces the view that people with disabilities are somehow ‘less than human'. In taking exception to these, and related, conceptions of disability, this book explores one of the crucial contexts within which the marginal status of disabled people is experienced: the interrelationships between disability, physical access, and the built environment. The author seeks to  explore some of the critical processes underpinning the social construction and production of disability as a state of marginalization and oppression in the built environment. These concerns are interwoven with a discussion of the changing role of the state in defining, categorising, and (re)producing ‘states of disablement' for people with disabilities.  Focusing primarily on the United Kingdom, although with a substantial discussion of disability and access issues in the USA, the book also considers the role of the ‘design professionals', architects, planners, and building control officers, in the construction of specific spaces and places, which, literally, lock people with disabilities ‘out'. From the shattered paving stones along the high street, to the absence of induction loops in a civic building, people with disabilities daily negotiate through hostile environments. Using a range of empirical material, the book documents how the environmental planning system in the United Kingdom is attempting to address the inaccessible nature of the built environment for people with disabilities, while discussing how disabled people are contesting the constraints placed upon their mobility.  The book draws on a range of ideas from geography, sociology, and environmental planning and reflects the emergent interest in planning schools with equal opportunity issues and planning for minority groups. It will be relevant to final year geography, planning, and architecture courses and postgraduate planning courses.	1996-05-28	SAGE						ZZZ000000

This book gives voice to four psychologists (Schofield, Slaughter-Defoe, Eccles, and Betz) who use scientific inquiry to understand what helps and what hinders the academic and life performance of minority students and girls. These are scientists who approach their subject matter with technical skill and personal passion to ask such questions as: What has desegregation accomplished? Can beneficial parent-child interactions be facilitated so as to improve school-related performance? Why are we seeing such low levels of achievement for girls and minorities in math and science? What stops women and minorities from choosing and completing majors in science and engineering? Each chapter represents an effort to communicate a vital area of scientific investigation to those in political life who could use that knowledge to formulate effective public policy. Near the end of each chapter are the questions that each of the authors was asked following the original briefing. These interchanges will show how policy makers begin to think about the use of scientific information in a political context.	1997-09-10	Sage Publications						ZZZ000000

This book explores whether modern ICTs can deliver on their promises of democracy and prosperity for the people of developing nations who comprise 80 per cent of the world’s population. In order to do this, this volume uses lessons from the Indian experience—a country where information technology (IT) has made giant leaps, but which suffers from what has been described as multiple `digital divides`./-//-/The contributors explore four such closely interrelated divides. The first is internal—between the digitally empowered rich and the poor. The second is a linguistic-cultural gap between English and other languages and between `Anglo-Saxon culture` and other world cultures. The next gap is underscored by disparities in access to information technology and between rich and poor nations. Finally, there is the phenomenon of the `digerati`. This is an affluent elite possessing the appropriate skills and means to take advantage of the ICTs.	2004-03-01	SAGE Publications						ZZZ000000
9780803993532	Revisualizing boundaries,a plurilingual ethos	Lachman Mulchand Khubchandani		The prevailing paradigm of modern linguistic scholarship is based on the notion of conflict resolution, which makes it imperative to demolish one theory in favor of another. Revisualizing Boundaries sets out to create a new agenda that probes the contours of plurality consciousness in studies of language. Focusing on the strengths of complementary orientations, author Lachman M. Khubchandani examines areas ranging from methodological constructs, the role of minority languages and diglossia, to language modernizations and planning the role of language elites. Khubchandani also makes a strong case for moving away from the monolith of language traditions to a framework that places the boundaries of speech spectrums in a fluid transactional mode. Focusing on the dynamics of language as an institution, this unique study highlights the nonlinear characteristics of natural languageùits openness and overlapping boundaries, which meet the demands of a fuzzy reality. This approach promotes a dialogue among those who treat language as an instrument of power and those who wish to move beyond narrow definitions to regard language as a synergetic network inspiring trust in cross-cultural settings. Lucidly written, Revisualizing Boundaries will be interest to all those involved with sociolinguistics, linguistic theory, cultural studies, and communication in a plural setting.	1997	Sage Publications						ZZZ000000

9780761932451	Countering gender violence,initiatives towards collective action in Rajasthan	Kanchan Mathur		Violence constitutes a major form of oppressing women. Rooted in the practical experiences of rural Indian women, Countering Gender Violence explores those facets of social, cultural and economic life that otherwise appear to have little bearing on gender violence and hence are rarely examined./-//-/This book studies the phenomenon of violence which, while being meted out to individual women, is systematically rooted in the social pattern of gender relations. Addressing gender violence requires challenging the means by which gender roles and power relations are defined and articulated in society. The book focuses on ways through which these relations can be altered in favour of women. /-//-/The author concludes that strategies for countering gender violence must emerge from women’s collective and shared experience of both subordination and empowerment.	2004-09-01	SAGE						ZZZ000000
9780761902737	Legitimacy in public administration,a discourse analysis	O. C. McSwite		In this "postmodern, end-of-the-century" moment, the question of what role public administration can legitimately play in a democratic society has deepened and taken on increased urgency. At the same time the movement toward global marketization has gained enormous momentum, traditional prejudices and racial and ethnic violence have appeared with a renewed virulence, presenting unprecedented challenges to democratic governments. Legitimacy in Public Administration reveals how the issue of administrative legitimacy is directly implicated, indeed central, to this broader issue. It argues that legitimacy hinges at the generic level on the question of alterityùhow to regard and relate to "different others." This book reviews the history of the legitimacy issue in the literature of American public administration with the purpose of demonstrating that this discourse has been distorted by an underlying and undisclosed commitment to an elitist "Man of Reason" model of the public administratorÆs role. Current attempts to reformulate administration to meet the challenge of new conditions will fail, the author argues, because they have not escaped the grip of this implicit distortion. Legitimacy in Public Administration includes a challenging concluding chapter that uses insights from gender theory and demonstrates the connection between the legitimacy question and the critical problem of alterity. The author also offers a new way to fundamentally reframe the legitimacy question, so as not only to help the field of public administration resolve it, but to show how this resolution can create a new understanding of the problem of racial and ethnic prejudice.	1997-07-02	Sage Publications						ZZZ000000

9780761932277	Identity and religion,foundations of anti-Islamism in India	Amalendu Misra		Amalendu Misra shows that while some eminent nationalist leaders were implacably hostile to Muslims, even wholly secular ones were uneasy with India’s Muslim past and had a generally unfavourable disposition towards both Muslims and Islam. The book explicates this by focusing on the writings of Vivekananda, Gandhi, Nehru and Savarkar supported by a wealth of examples from a wide range of contexts. It argues that the views of these four prominent individuals were heavily shaped by British historiography as well as their respective visions of independent India. The author goes on to suggest how modern India needs to redefine itself to flourish as a genuinely secular democracy.	2004	SAGE						ZZZ000000

9780803945708	Advancing family preservation practice	E. Susan Morton&R. Kevin Grigsby		The breakdown of the family has been blamed for many of today's societal ills. Are there effective ways to support a family with problems (neglect, substance abuse, terminal illness, etc.), prevent its break up, and make a positive change? How effective has the Intensive Family Preservation Services (IFPS) been at solving these kinds of family problems and situations? What about families that don't respond to IFPS programs? Do the programs differ in their effectiveness? Through an exploration of these issues, knowledgeable contributors offer their own experiences as a basis for tracing the evolution of IFPS and of the advances that have been made in the field. Advancing Family Preservation Practice covers such topics as the evolution of family preservation and the theories that guide it, child protective services, clinician-support worker teams, and the relative effectiveness of family preservation services with neglectful families. Aimed at helping evaluators, practitioners, and administrators incorporate what has been discovered in IFPS practice, Advancing Family Preservation Practice is an important resource for those involved in the development, implementation, and evaluation of family programs. "The issues [covered in Advancing Family Preservation Practice] are very relevant to the debates that are going on across the country among administrators, advocates, and legislators, as states are struggling to balance budgets with fewer federal dollars and skyrocketing costs for mandated health and social welfare programs. Support for "preventive services" will only continue to be available if these programs can be shown to be both successful in preventing family dissolution and cost-effective. Advancing Family Preservation Practice provides the most extensive documentation to date on potential program benefits of intensive family preservation services using program descriptions and research findings from established practice centers across the country. Policymakers and practitioners need to read this book. Faced with the task of providing a safe alternative to foster care for children who have been abused or neglected, the material compiled in this text is essential to a realistic assessment of potential outcomes for children and families at high risk." --Linda Heisner, Director Office of Family & Children's Services, Maryland Department of Human Resources, Baltimore "This is a scholarly, down-to-earth book for all those who serve children and their parents. Bold, imaginative and practical, this volume crosses those disciplinary lines that separate social work, medicine, nursing, psychology, law, and education; and it captures how paraprofessionals function as supervised "experts" in transmitting the hands-on knowledge from all these disciplines into front-line, state-of-the-art, home-centered services for children at risk of losing their parents and their vitality. This book is a vital resource because it packs hard-earned empirical knowledge into an upward spiral of rediscovering and innovating community-based, home-centered services for disadvantaged children and their parents; and for those dedicated adults who have the competence and the passion to serve them." --Albert J.

9780761944645	Youth and crime	John Muncie		`Muncie's book is a must-read for all criminologists interested in youth justice and youth crime. It is accessible, theoretically informed, empirically detailed and, thanks to the second edition, bang up-to-date' - Professor Tim Newburn, London School of Economics  `The first edition of Youth and Crime - published in 1999 - struck an almost unique balance between accessibility and complex scholarship. This substantially revised and up-dated edition takes the depth and scope of the key debates further still. Muncie draws on a wide range of scholarly research, he engages with major theoretical questions and he interrogates the complexities and contradictions of policy formation.... Without doubt this is an indispensable source for sociology, criminology, social policy, social history, social work, youth justice and media and cultural studies students and tutors alike' - Dr Barry Goldson, Senior Lecturer in Sociology and Social Policy, The University of Liverpool.  `The second edition of Youth and Crime is once again immensely scholarly and important for its insights into the shape of public, media and governmental responses to youth crime. The author produces new material on anti-social behaviour, street crime, victimisation, social exclusion, drugs and surveillance as well as on risk assessment, governance, globalisation and cultural criminology to help make sense of developments..... As before, this is an excellent, accessible and lively introduction to youth crime and its regulation. It is a book that pushes debate forward in terms of questioning established knowledge and governmental responses to crime' - Dr Loraine Gelsthorpe, Institute of Criminology, University of Cambridge.  `Muncie observes, "the study of youth justice ultimately tells us more about social order, the state and political decision making than it does about the nature of young offending and the most effective ways to respond to it": the material he presents in this part of the book more than justifies the comment. Although this book is primarily a student text, it should interest magistrates and promote critical reflection' - Magistrate  · How and why have certain aspects of young people's behaviour come to be perceived as `anti-social' and 'criminal'?  · Are young people now more of a threat than ever before?  · How can we make sense of New Labour's youth justice reforms? · Is the youth justice system soft on crime?  · Are young people more in need of protection than disciplinary punishment?  The Second Edition of this best-selling text provides a fully revised and up-to-date critical analysis of a wide range of issues surrounding young people, disorder and crime.  To develop a comprehensive criminology of youth the book deliberately moves beyond traditional criminological concerns and draws insights from other academic disciplines such as cultural studies, gender studies, media studies, social policy, social work, political science and human geography.   Now thoroughly updated, this second edition has been rewritten to include new material on anti-social behaviour, street crime, youth gangs, victimisation, social exclusion, drugs, surveillance, crime prevention, policing and restoration as well as a sustained critical analysis of New Labour's youth, social and criminal justice reforms as they have emerged over the past five years. To make sense of these developments theories of risk management, governance, globalisation and cultural criminology are introduced and assessed.  An original and accessible text, it provides invaluable support for further study by featuring key concepts, a glossary, summaries of the main arguments, study questions and guides to further reading.   Building on the strengths of the first edition, this highly influential work remains the most integrated and comprehensive analysis of theory, research, policy and politics in this area. It is an essential text for students of criminology, criminal justice, sociology, youth studies, social policy and social work.	2004-06-11	SAGE						ZZZ000000

9780761907855	Feminist foundations,toward transforming sociology	Kristen A. Myers&Cynthia D. Anderson&Barbara J. Risman		There can be no doubt that feminism, and its influence on the academy, has wrought enormous changes on the social sciences in general and sociology in particular. This edited volume is an outgrowth of a discussion that began on the Sociologists for Women in Society Listserve, in which participants were asked to talk about key pieces in feminist scholarship that had particularly influenced their sociological thinking. Editors Kristen A. Myers, Cynthia D. Anderson, and Barbara J. Risman have chosen articles that fall into what they consider the intellectual genres that compose feminist sociology. This collection differs from others because the editors avoid organizing material by substantive specialty areas (i.e., family, race and ethnicity, criminology, or methods). Their vision instead sees sociology as an integrated discipline, where feminist contributions have systematically influenced the shape of the whole by similarly influencing the distinct parts. In addition to simply compiling a comprehensive list of important articles from the last two decades, the editors have invited major feminist scholars to comment and reflect on the articles in each section of the book. These reflections help provide the historical and social context in which feminist scholarship has taken place.  This book will be of obvious appeal to feminist scholars and gender sociologists. Yet, as feminist thought rightfully takes its place away from the margins and toward the center of the discipline, this book stands as a rich and useful resource for any contemporary theory course.	1998	Sage Publications						ZZZ000000

On the basis of abundant qualitative and quantitative data, it strongly repudiates the case of the critics, and demonstrates that India has been a significant beneficiary of the globalization process.The policy conclusion that flows from this experience is that India ought to be, in general, more open to globalization, in the interest of sustaining economic growth and enhancing the welfare of its people.

9780803976733	Counselling difficult clients	Kingsley Norton&Gill McGauley		Counselors and other mental health professionals will inevitably encounter clients who are difficult to work with because they do not conform with the basic requirements of forming a trusting relationship and accepting help or advice. Such clients can place enormous strain on those who are trying to help them and this book sets out a range of practical guidelines for the management of these difficult, disturbed, or disturbing clients. The authors concentrate on the everyday difficulties of the transaction between practitioner and client in their respective social contexts, rather than locating the problems solely within the client and indicate ways in which these difficulties can be successfully overcome. Complementing rather than competing with practitionersÆ own treatment styles, Working with Difficult Clients acknowledges that not all professionals have access to team-based resources. Providing practical advice backed up by carefully chosen examples and with a sound theoretical base, this book will be an invaluable resource for counselors, probation officers, social workers, and other mental health professionals.	1998-02-06	Sage Publications						ZZZ000000

The conference continues to grow in popularity, and the internationally derived community of regular and occasional contributors to this conference are reflected in the papers that have been selected for Volume III. There is a critical mass dimension to these volumes because not only do the papers represent a time slice of state-of-the-art high technology small firm research in a given year, but they also add to the evolving body of work with a time series dimension. The main themes addressed by the 1995 HTSF Conference fell into two major and two smaller groupings. Two major themes of Finance (five papers) and Networking (six papers) maintain the importance of these research areas established in Volume II, while a smaller continuing representation is provided by work on Firm Survival and Growth Studies (two papers), an a welcome new theme of Human Resource Issues (two papers).	1997-05-28	Paul Chapman						ZZZ000000

9780761962052	Recreating men,postmodern masculinity politics	Bob Pease		One of the most central issues for women's prospects for equality is whether man can and will change. Changing the social relations of gender will involve changing menÆs subjectives as well as their daily practices. This book asks whether this is possible. Bob Pease examines how men, who are supportive of feminism, are responding to the feminist challenge, through an exploration of their experiences and dilemmas in trying to live out their feminist commitment and resist hegemonic forms of masculinity. The book is driven by practical as well as theoretical concerns, and aims to develop strategies that will promote the process of change towards equality in gender relations. Drawing on a critical postmodern theoretical framework, Pease argues that it is possible for men to reposition themselves in patriarchal discourses and to reformulate their interests in challenging gender domination.

This book remedies this absence.Part One provides a theoretical framework which helps the reader make sense of the detail contained in the later case studies. It also locates quality improvement in the special political and organizational context of the public sector. It shows how choosing a particular concept of quality has significant political and organizational consequences and also discusses how quality may be measured.In Part Two seven case studies illuminate detailed operational issues in quality improvement by d	1995	SAGE						ZZZ000000
9780803986671	Joseph Wolpe	Roger Poppen		Joseph Wolpe brought about a revolution in psychotherapy. He provided the first clear alternative to therapy as an esoteric exploration of mental forces and presented, instead, clearly specified procedures and documented outcomes - a practical technology based on a fundamental science of learning.  Roger Poppen, who witnessed some of this revolution first hand as a doctoral student, describes the major impact Wolpe's theories had on psychotherapy, compelling it to address issues of effectiveness and accountability. He assesses the criticisms that Wolpe's work has attracted both from outside and within the behavioural school, and describes the development of Wolpe's ideas and his continuing role in the theory, practice and ev	1995-11	Sage						ZZZ000000

9780761905264	Understanding disability,a lifespan approach	Peggy Quinn		Over the past 30 years, attitudes toward people with disabilities have changed dramatically, moving from deinstitutionalization in the 1960s to the Disability Rights Movement of the 1970s and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. The results of this shift have been to move more and more people with disabilities into mainstream activities in their communities. Social workers and other health and mental health professionals are now encountering people with a wide range of disabilities at various stages of their lives. It is important to be prepared. Understanding Disability details expected developmental stages for those without disabilities as well as the impact of disability at each of these periods. This is a much needed reference for working with a person with a disability, or with a family member or other interested party. Beginning with infancy and the diagnosis of congenital or early onset disabilities, the book identifies traditional developmental life stages and then provides specific information for four different disabilities: Down syndrome, visual impairment, cerebral palsy, and spina bifida. In addition, spinal cord injury is added at the young adult stage of some adapted expectations. In keeping with a social work emphasis on strengths, the book is based on a social, rather than medical, model of disability. The information in this book allows the social worker to create treatment plans, coordinate with other professionals, and competently assist the person with the disability and his/her family. Filling the void in literature on disabilities since the Disabilities Act of 1990, Understanding Disability will be a most valuable resource for social workers, counselors, and nurses.	1998	Sage Publications						ZZZ000000
9780803993495	Peasant moorings,village ties and mobility rationales in South India	Jean-Luc Racine		Most migration studies focus on the growing phenomenon of rural-urban migration. This unusual volume explores an equally significant, but less noticed, phenomenon, namely that the existence of a large and increasing urban population has not yet prevented the growth of the rural population in India. The reasons why people stay where they are have become as important as the factors that encourage them to migrate. The use of anthropological methods in conjunction with survey research helps highlight economic and sociocultural factors in all their diversity, as also the range of strategies used by villagers to adapt to their circumstances. Peasant Moorings provides valuable insights into the dynamics and impact of population mobility. It also underlines the potentially tragic consequences if IndiaÆs rural population were to become less attached to their roots in the future. Peasant Moorings will be of considerable interest to policymakers and planners, geographers, economists, and anthropologists as well as those engaged in the fields of urban studies, rural development, and migration studies.	1997-03-01	French Institute						ZZZ000000
9780761995319	Unleashing India on world markets	Raghu Nandan		Unleashing India on World Markets takes a hard look at the poor performance of Indian exports in various sectors, be it goods, services or tourism. Viewing the issue from a unique perspective, the book discusses possible measures the country can take to realise its full potential in the world market. Maintaining that shifting the blame onto the Government is neither helpful nor reflective of the entire story, it seeks to identify the real problems and bottlenecks. Drawing upon his 30 years of experience as a senior executive and consultant across 24 developing nations, Raghu Nandan does some plain speaking about the mindset of India s business people and corporate leaders as also their very approach towards the business of exports. He addresses a number of pertinent issues, such as why Indian business people accord low priority to exports, the problems foreign buyers face in dealing with Indian Industry, and the problems Indian exporters have in dealing with and through non-resident Indians.	2001-07-01	Response Books						ZZZ000000
9780761992141	Secularism, democracy, justice,implications of Rawlsian principles in India	Nalini Rajan		For the major part of the 20th century, the concepts of individual liberty and social justice have been viewed as being mutually exclusive. However, John Rawls?? Theory of Justice (1971) radically altered this perspective by providing the most elaborate example of the coexistence of liberty and egalitarian principles. The first principle of his theory refers to liberty while the second principle (pertaining to social justice) consists of fair equality of opportunity and the difference principle. Secularism, Democracy, Justice undertakes the difficult, yet challenging, task of applying these Rawlsian principles to four major areas??secularism, democracy, social justice, and agency??in Indian context. Relying largely on the Kantian notions of rationality and universality, Nalini Rajan combines a philosophical analysis of the Rawlsian framework with a defense of certain kinds of state policies. Within these four major areas, she discusses secularism and the rationale for a uniform civil code; the necessity for greater democratic participation as well as its limits; the importance of positive discrimination to combat social backwardness; and the role of self and of universality in realizing human agency. While the issues raised are riddled with practical and theoretical difficulties, this book effectively seeks answers to some of the major problems plaguing fragile institutions like secularism, democracy, and social justice.	1998	Sage Publications						ZZZ000000

The country now seems well set to provide universal and good quality basic education. Yet, behind this otherwise rosy picture lie serious concerns relating primarily to gender and equity. /-//-/This volume provides an insightful understanding of the ground realities of primary education programmes, particularly those run by the District Primary Education Programme (DPEP). Combining secondary research with field studies conducted in six states, the contributors explore gender and social equity issues in primary education. They conclude that there is a subtle but nevertheless discernible ‘hierarchy of access’ to education, which has resulted in new forms of segregation in primary schools.	2004	Sage Publications						ZZZ000000

Culture is now at the core of debate.  Culture and Economy After the Cultural Turn examines the impact of the cultural turn for the social sciences in relation to the decline of interest in economic aspects of society. It presents a number of responses to the changing relationship between culture and economy, and to the in which the cultural turn has sought to understand it.

This challenging book provides a clear and accessible account of what the cultural turn means. It will be recommended reading for students of cultural studies, sociology, political economy, politics and organization studies. 	1999	SAGE						ZZZ000000

9780803928695	Preventing maladjustment from infancy through adolescence	Annette U. Rickel&LaRue Allen		Authoritative and thoroughly researched, Preventing Maladjustment from Infancy Through Adolescence examines the theoretical and historical issues of prevention with children and youth, and delineates those factors which place the individual at risk. The authors begin with an historical overview of prevention research, essential concepts and research practices for identifying populations at risk, and alternative types of intervention programs. Prevention programs are reviewed in relation to several specific types of dysfunctions evident in infancy, childhood, and adolescence. Key topics of contemporary clinical work are covered including emotional problems associated with child abuse, divorce and marital separation, and chronic medical disease. Preventing Maladjustment from Infancy Through Adolescence will serve as an excellent text for advanced level undergraduate and graduate courses dealing with preventive interventions for infants, children, and adolescents. In addition, graduate courses in such areas as clinical, community, and developmental psychology will find this book a highly useful supplemental text. "A superlative selection for the discerning reader with a special interest in psychiatric studies and in jurisprudence." --Midwest Book Review "Thoughtful, well-written, and important contributions to the prevention literature." --Leonard A. Jason, De Paul University "The authors have done mental health professionals a valuable service in pulling together a wide literature on preventive interventions with children. . . . concisely and lucidly written and organized within a developmental framework. Numerous research studies are critically summarized and directions for future research clearly anticipated." --William H. Sack, The Oregon Health Science University "An excellent job in condensing incredibly diverse and complex literatures into a coherent, readable collection of preventive efforts with infants, children, and adolescents. . . . [The authors] convey a sense of excitement about the creative programs that have already been attempted. They eloquently stress the importance of influencing social policy if one is going to turn the goals of prevention and the 'hopes' roused by the demonstration projects into widespread reality for children. . . . A helpful beginning step for those entering any of the fields related to preventive interventions and/or child mental health." --The Community Psychologist "This is an excellent brief introduction that will be much appreciated by teachers of prevention courses. I plan to require it of both my undergraduate and graduate students." --N. Dickon Reppucci, University of Virginia "A lucid and entertaining introduction to the study of language and discourse. The authors analyze social texts of all kinds and offer interesting exemplars to illustrate important concepts and theoretical ideas. Although I disagree with the author's critique of the neo-positivist research tradition, I still found the book provocative." --Mary Anne Fitzpatrick, University of Wisconsin "This volume reflects Rickel and Allen's sensitivity to a variety of developmental prevention issues related to child, parent, and family dysfunction as well as social policy. This book provides a good exposure to the field of prevention and points to excellent references for those interested in establishing prevention programs, evaluating program effectiveness, or assuming an advocacy role.

Riessman organizes her discussion in a down-to-earth way. . . ." --Patricia Uberoi in Contributions to Indian Sociology "Her concise and well-organized book, Narrative Analysis, contributes important insights to the qualitative methods literature. It is directed toward scholars and graduate students of various disciplines, as a methodological guide for analyzing transcripts of first-person stories or experiences. The book is also relevant for researchers interested in the substantive areas of women's lives and medical sociology . . . . Riessman's book provides a useful guide for marketing researchers; particularly those aligned with the interpretive camp . . . . because marketing researchers are increasingly interested in studying both consumers' and managers' stories. . . Narrative Analysis should be useful to an even wider audience."    --George M. Zinkhan & Denise E.

Published by Sage, the leading publisher of qualitative research in the social sciences today . . . . The heart of her tightly argued text turns on forms of narrative (linked stories, conversations, life stories) and their analysis . . . . This work should be read against and alongside Atkinson and Silverman . . . . This work brings the communication scholar up-to-date on where qualitative methods are in current sociological and educational discourse." --Norman K. Denzin in Journal of Communication "[This book] does what it intends to do and does that clearly and with lively and interesting examples. I think both students and teachers will find it compelling and useful. I plan to assign it in my seminar on narrative and description next semester."   --Jay Gubrium, University of Florida "In this text, Catherine Kohler Riessman discusses many of the important questions that face narrative scholars. As such, the book is a good introductory text for narrative methodology. For those who have read within the field previously, this work reminds the reader of some of the important questions that need to be addressed in narrative work . . . . This text is a valuable effort in an attempt to synthesize some of the main aspects of narrative methodology."   --Journal of Contemporary Ethnography "An excellent resource for individuals interested in the systematic use of narrative in social science research."   --The American Journal of Family Therapy People tell stories to help organize and make sense of their lives. In the past, their narratives have often been torn apart by social scientists looking for themes, variables, and specific answers to specific questions. But in recent years, the development of narrative analysis has given life to the study of the narrative as a form of information for social research. Why are they constructed as they are? How does one dissect a narrative to understand the lived experience of the narrator? What steps can the researcher take to translate these tales and life stories into usable research? Catherine Kohler Riessman provides a detailed primer on the use of narrative analysis, its theoretical underpinnings and worldview, and the methods it uses. Replete with examples and transcriptions from previous narrative studies, her book is a useful introduction to this growing body of literature.	1993	SAGE						ZZZ000000

9780761992707	Negotiation and social space,a gendered analysis of changing kin and security networks in South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa	Carla Risseeuw&Kamala Ganesh		An AltaMira Press Book  Deviating significantly from the existing discourses on family and kinship, this volume of original essays (a companion to SHIFTING CIRCLES OF SUPPORT, AltaMira Press, 1996) offers a fresh conceptualization which views individuals and, then, relationships as crucial elements.Through a combination of macro and micro perspectives, it provides a comparative and gendered analysis of shifts within marriage, family kin and social networks of people who live in societies undergoing substantial change in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. The analysis develops a critique of certain hegemonic qualities of the term "family," its supposedly unchanging character, as well as its assumed harmonious nature. In fact, the family is viewed as a primary social arena where relationships are constantly renegotiated and which, while providing valuable security and support, also contains exploitation and violence. Overall, the volume articulates a fresh approach to kinship and family through which subtle erosions in the security of vulnerable individuals--not only women, but also children and the elderly--can be uncovered. It highlights the importance of the comparative perspective and the urgency of adopting such an approach for policy initiatives.	1998	Sage Publications						ZZZ000000
9780761943150	Pierre Bourdieu 2	Derek Robbins		This sequel to the successful Pierre Bourdieu (4 Vols) edited by Derek Robbins in 2000. Bourdieu died in 2002 and the new set extends the critical appreciation of his achievement and considers responses to his work that have occurred since his death. The four volumes are divided into seven sections: Globalization; Interviews; Methodology and Philosophy of Social Science; Concepts Revisited; Some examples of the socio-political engagement of the intellectual; Critiques; Reviews and Obituaries. The sheer scale of Bourdieu's achievements is slowly being recognized. His work in developing relational sociology, criticizing distributive injustice and exposing how power operates amounts to one of the first-rank of major, durable contributions in post-war Sociology.Robbins is one of the best informed and stimulating critical interpreters of Bourdieu's thought. He has a range of knowledge to enable illuminating connections to be made with philosophy, sociology, culture and politics. This is the perfect complement to Pierre Bourdieu (2000) and enables readers to revitalize their understanding of this prominent social thinker.

9780951923009	Towards the twenty-first century,the challenge for small business	Martyn Robertson&Elizabeth Chell&Colin Mason		'As a crystal-gazing exercise, this book has much merit. It certainly highlights the fact that small business has an important role to play in the future economic survival of the world as we know it!' - Enterprise Magazine As the start of a new millennium approaches, new opportunities and challenges face the small-business sector in economies across the world, whether in developed countries, newly industrialized countries, developing countries, or the merging-market economies of Eastern Europe. The policies for developing small enterprises followed in the past are not necessarily those which will be needed to face the challenges to come. What is certain, however, is that small firms will play a large part in rejuvenating the economies of Eastern Europe, expanding those of the West, and growing those of the developing world.  This book analyzes the opportunities, problems and challenges for the small-firms sector as the millennium approaches. Specialists examine a wide range of issues, which it is essential policymakers, politicians, academic researchers, and all those involved in economic development should know about and understand. The book examines such fields as informal risk capital and other aspects of the provision of finance, small business and the state, small firm turbulence, the controversial question of enterprise culture, growth characteristics in small and medium-sized manufacturers, women in self-employment, the growing phenomenon of home-working, particularly in the high technology sector, networking, and the increasingly important service sector.  The papers were presented at the 13th National Small Firms' Policy and Research Conference in 1990.  Published on behalf of UKEMRA.	1992-07-28	Nadamal Books						ZZZ000000

Behaviour Management with Young Children brings together Bill's insight into behaviour management and Elizabeth's understanding of young children and has resulted in a practical and realistic behaviour management manual that will be easily accessible to teachers in the early years...I shall be recommending it to all my teaching and support staff as essential reading' - Debbie Hoy, Headteacher, Brookland Infant & Nursery School, Cheshunt, Hertfordshire 'As headteacher of an Infant and Nursery School with children from 3-7 years old, Bill and Elizabeth's book is what we have been waiting for. A comprehensive guide to the effective behaviour management of our youngest children, it will be essential reading for all our staff...This is a book which can easily be read from cover to cover, as it is difficult to put down, but for busy practitioners it is equally useful to dip into if you want help with a specific aspect of behaviour management.

The book is a delight to read and will be a constant source of inspiration and guidance to us all' - Cathy Whalen, Headteacher, Mousehold Infant and Nursery School, Norwich, Norfolk 'With their feet firmly planted in the reality of the classroom Bill and Elizabeth show how subtle changes to everyday interchanges between adults and pupils can have an enormous impact upon pupil success.

9781412923569	Cracking the Hard Class	Bill Rogers		Praise for the First Edition:  `In Cracking the Hard Class, the undisputed master of behaviour management, Bill Rogers, shows us that being an effective teacher isn't a result of God-given gifts of charisma and presence, but can be developed through a series of specific skills and learns actions. It's one of the mot useful books around for new teachers... If you can catch him live on one of his UK roadshows, you're in for a real treat. This practical approach from a writer who has clearly retained at least a notional foot in the classroom is the one that works best for me' - Geoff Barton, The Times Education Supplement  `This book would certainly be invaluable to colleagues in the school where some had done the course and others had learnt it second hand. It would have a place in the staffroom of most schools, especially in the secondary sector. Bill Rogers is clearly a charismatic teacher what he offers is based on secure knowledge of child psychology, classroom dynamics and staffroom politics' - Emotional & Behavioural Difficulties  `This is an excellent book for teachers at any key stage who have one or more "difficult" pupils in their class, as well as those with the "hard class". It provides simple and effective behaviour management strategies and makes you realise you are not alone and that it's okay to have a bad day. It mainly discusses secondary education but does refer to primary. Many of the strategies are suitable for all levels anyway. An absolute must-have for a teacher' - Amazon Review  At some point in every teacher's career he/she will encounter the `hard class' and from day one the countdown to the end of the day, term and year is on in earnest. But as demanding as it may be, a difficult class does not have to dominate and permeate through all waking moments. Bill Rogers, in Cracking the Hard Class, Second Edition, highlights many practical strategies that can be implemented to overcome the hard class syndrome.  These include: identifying what makes a class `hard'; developing a class behaviour plan; developing colleague support; following up on disruptive students; changing patterns of bad behaviour; and assisting relief teachers and the hard class.  As well as constructive ideas and strategies, Cracking the Hard Class, Second Edition also highlights the normality of the pressures and stress felt by teachers dealing with these classes.	2006-10-31	SAGE						ZZZ000000

9780826458186	Orthodox and alternative medicine,politics, professionalization, and health care	Mike Saks		'There's no book like it. It's Saks' subject and he's good' - Roy Porter  This fascinating book explores the changing relationship between orthodox and alternative medicine in Britain and the United States from the 16th century to the present day. Mike Saks sees the development of orthodox and alternative medicine as two sides of the same coin and his analysis centers on the role of professionalization in health care. In the sixteenth century, the line between orthodox and alternative medicine was blurred. By the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, the increasing professionalization of orthodox bio-medicine had marginalized medical alternatives. In recent years, following the growth of a strong counter-culture in the 1960s and 1970s, perceptions of the relationship between the two forms of practice have begun to change again. The de-professionalization of orthodox medicine is being debated, while ironically, alternative medicine has become increasingly professionalized.   Mike Saks considers the political dynamics of the process of professionalization, and looks at the dilemmas posed for both medical orthodoxy and alternative medicine in the development of a more integrated health care system in Britain and America in the future.	2003	Continuum						ZZZ000000

9780761917908	The 8% solution,preventing serious, repeat juvenile crime	Michael Allen Schumacher&Gwen A. Kurz		The public perception is that juvenile crime is out-of- hand and that no one can do anything about it. Research, however, shows that a mere 8% of juvenile offenders arrested and sent to juvenile court commit more than half of all repeat juvenile crimes, including violence. And, something is being done about it! The surprising fact is that this "8%" can be picked out at the time of their first arrest. This book represents seven years of research on 6,400 young people having their first brush with the law in Orange County, California. It provides an exemplary state-supported model now used in six other California counties to curb the rise in the arrest of kids. A practical, commonsense guide, this book focuses on long-term solutions to the problem of serious repeat juvenile crime and offers a proven pathway for improvement. The 8% Solution informs students, policy makers, criminal justice professionals, juvenile courts, probation departments, and parents of how to mount a successful response. Written in narrative style with a liberal use of anecdotal incidents, this is an easy-to-read description of the characteristics of kids who repeatedly get in trouble with the law and more cost-effective ways to correct the problem.	2000	Sage Publications						ZZZ000000

Halpern book and find it to be both timely and a needed resource in the area of program evaluation." --Robert W. Covert, Evaluation Research Center, University of Virginia "Very clearly and systematically presented and will be of considerable value to evaluation practitioners and consumers of evaluation reports as well as to those directly involved in the conduct of meta-evaluations. For the meta-evaluator this book is probably the clearest and most comprehensive handbook available, and it will surely be found invaluable by anyone required to conduct a meta-evaluation of either a naturalistic or a conventional evaluation. Evaluation practitioners will find the book extremely helpful as it will force them to think more rigorously about the design and execution of their studies and to document more carefully their work. . . . This is an extremely well written and useful book which is sure to find a wide audience among all who are concerned with assessing and enhancing the quality of evaluations." --Evaluation Practice This book provides a detailed discussion of the use of an auditing model for judging the quaity of naturalistic inquiries. The approach can be used retrospectively in judging the quality or trustworthiness of a naturalistic study upon its completion. It can be applied prospectively as well in planning a naturalistic study, for example in determining what ought to be placed in an audit trail and what might be done to increase the likelihood that trustworthiness criteria will be satisfied at the conclusion of the study. Detailed information is provided on constructing an audit trail from the written materials generated in a naturalistic study, conducting an audit (including specific auditor tasks and questions that focus the audit examination), and preparing an audit report.	1988	Sage Publications						ZZZ000000

9780761954071	Man enough,embodying masculinities	Victor J. Seidler		In this book, one of the leading contributors to the growing debate about men, masculinities, and sexual politics, Victor J. Seidler, criticizes the Enlightenment coupling of white, heterosexual masculinity with "reason." He argues that in modern society, masculinity can never be taken for granted. Men must always prove that they are "man enough" to cope in the "correct" way with the problems and challenges of everyday life. Seidler believes that men have to break this chain of obligations to the Enlightenment notion of masculinity. Through engaging with menÆs diverse relationships with their bodies, sexualities, emotional lives, feelings, and desires, Seidler explores ways of affirming masculinities while critically engaging with the power that men have in the wider society. The book is also a contribution to antisexist politics. Seidler is interested in taking on those forms of menÆs politics that find it difficult to engage with menÆs power and society and also those who take it for granted that male power is normal and natural. He seeks to recognize both the power that white, heterosexual masculinities have in shaping forms of philosophy and social theory while at the same time recognizing that masculinity cannot be simply defined as a relationship of power.	1997-11-24	Sage Publications						ZZZ000000

9780803996724	Ecology and the politics of survival,conflicts over natural resources in India	Vandana Shiva		In this volume, through case studies of forest conflicts and water conflicts in India, the authors have exposed the grim situation in a forceful and logical manner. Its logic does not remain confined to the Indian boundaries alone but extends to all over the world in general. . . . Dr. Vandana Shiva and her colleagues deserve profound admiration for their excellent work. It is a prize book, worthwhile to read and possess. --Indian Book Chronicle Relatively little has been written on India's ecological problems as they relate to political struggles: Shiva's stands apart as an essential treatise on the subject. --The Bookwatch The authors are some of the well-known experts in the field. . . . The book is worth reading, as it provides a comprehensive and in-depth current discussion on the issues of water and forest in India. --Development Update Due to thoughtless acts, our environment has endured harsh treatment, and in many cases, irreversible damage. Only now are we beginning to see some of the damage we have caused. Sponsored by the United Nation University's Programme on Peace and Global Transformation, this insightful volume analyzes ecology movements in contemporary society and the resulting conflicts over vital natural resources. The discussed theme relates to societies universally, and specifically addresses the intense and emerging social contradictions related to conflicts over natural resources rapidly surfacing in India. Looked at from a direct Third World perspective, rather than speculated by an outside perspective, the book examines how ecology movements have questioned the validity of dominant concepts of economic development in the world today. Shiva discusses thefundamental assumptions of modern economic development responsible for the conflicts and environmental degradation, and proposes a new development theory which supports sustainable development and the people's rights to justice and peace. Ecology and Politics of Survival will interest students and professors alike in ecology, environmental studies, development studies, sociology, and social studies of science. This work provides insights into the interlinkages between natural resource utilization and developmental priorities in India. . . . The book is an excellent contribution as it supports ecologists' sentiments with scientific data. It provides an insight into the unseen dimension of development programs. --Productivity The author provides systematic conceptual framework for analyzing the processes and structures of modern economic development from an ecological perspective. --Finance India The book under review by an author, who is both a scholar and an activist herself, is an eloquent expression of the ecological critique. The book, written in association with seven others, including the late B. V. Krishnamurthy, offers a well-articulated theoretical critique as well as a documentation of the conflicts over natural resources that took place in India in the seventies and the eighties. --Indian Journal of Agricultural Economics Indian writers about ecology and development, and Vandana Shiva in particular, are beginning to achieve the international attention they deserve. . . . It is a pioneering work because it provides an accessible set of explanations against which other case studies can be established and tested. . . . This powerful text by Shiva and colleagues . . . canhelp realize a change in training and thinking which we are all waiting for. --Pacific Affairs	1991	United Nations University Press						ZZZ000000

9780803976610	Discourses of counselling,HIV counselling as social interaction	David Silverman		In this book, David Silverman offers a fully researched and analytically sensitive account of how counselling, as a process, is dynamically constructed through the interaction of counsellor and client. Drawing on research on counselling of clients undergoing an HIV test, the author explores the ways in which conversations between counsellors and clients reflect, embody and subtly alter assumptions about the purpose, method and practice of counselling.This critical appreciation of the modes of engagement between counsellor and client will be of interest to researchers and students of counselling, psychotherapy and associated helping professions. Practitioners - particularly those involved in HIV and other health counselling - will be stimulated to reflect on and respond to Silverman's analysis in their own practice. The book will also be essential reading for researchers and students in the traditions of sociological work on interactionism, conversation analysis and ethnomethodology, applying these approaches in a sophisticated manner to the interactionist and conversational strategies adopted in a health promotion environment.	1997	Sage						ZZZ000000

9780761998273	Peasant movements in post-colonial India,dynamics of mobilization and identity	Debal K. SinghaRoy		The central concern of this book is to examine in a comparative framework, the ways in which grassroots mobilizations transform and institutionalize themselves, forge new collective identities and articulate new strategies for survival and resistance./-//-/Debal K SinghaRoy focuses on three major radical movements—Tebhaga and Naxalite in West Bengal and Telangana in Andhra Pradesh. Based on empirical data and supported by a wide range of secondary sources, the author argues that as spontaneous expressions of discontent against oppression, domination and marginalization turn into institutionalized movements, the space for radical challenge shrinks. As exemplified in West Bengal, the co-option of peasant movements by the state has largely stifled the scope for radical action. In Andhra Pradesh, on the other hand, the relative independence of the grassroots mobilization process has allowed the peasantry to exercise multiple options for collective action.	2004	SAGE						ZZZ000000

9781412951463	The kaleidoscope of gender,prisms, patterns, and possibilities	Joan Z. Spade&Catherine G. Valentine		I have found Spade and Valentine's Kaleidoscope of Gender to be the most effective reader that I have used in my undergraduate Sociology of Gender class, and I was delighted to see what promises to be an even better second edition that recently arrived. -Linda Grant, University of Georgia In a substantial theoretical introduction, Spade and Valentine move their discussion forward by introducing their kaleidoscope metaphor which is comprised of the prisms of culture...that intersect to produce patterns of difference and systems of privilege. Because it captures the fluidity and uniqueness of the intricate patterns, the kaleidoscope is a valuable analytical tool. Though it enters a terrain already littered with terminology, this prismatic understanding of gender has great potential for transforming current conceptualizations. -Jennifer Keys, North Central CollegeExamining the elusive, evolving construct of gender in a unique text/ reader format An accessible, timely, and stimulating introduction to the sociology of gender, The Kaleidoscope of Gender: Prisms, Patterns, and Possibilities, Second Edition, provides a comprehensive analysis of key ideas, theories, and applications in this field as viewed through the metaphor of a kaleidoscope. This collection of creative articles by top scholars explains how the complex, evolving pattern of gender is constructed interpersonally, institutionally, and culturally and challenges students to question how gender shapes their daily lives. Like the prior edition, the Second Edition maintains a focus on contemporary contributions to the field while incorporating classical and theoretical arguments to provide a broad framework. Integrating a cross-cultural focus and intersectional inquiry, this unique text/reader vividly illustrates that gender is a malleable continuum of prisms, patterns, and possibilities. New to the Second Edition · 27 new readings, including interdisciplinary research articles as well as articles from the popular media, complement the 23 readings retained from the prior edition · Updated extensive introductions to each chapter provide a helpful framework for the readings to follow and include the most recent statistics, new concepts, and references · Increased emphasis on readings about social movements for equality (Chapter 10), a sharper focus on work (7), and new readings on domestic violence such as an article on rape on college campuses (8) · An even greater emphasis on intersectional analysis and a deeper understanding of masculinities Instructor's Resources on CD-ROM: Available to qualified instructors (contact info@sagepub.com), the CD includes ideas for class exercises, video suggestions, assignments, and more. Intended Audience This text/ reader is ideal for undergraduate courses such as the Sociology of Sex and Gender, Gender and Sexuality, Race, Class, Gender, and Sexuality; and related courses in departments of sociology, women's studies, and gender studies.	2007-12-10	Pine Forge Press						ZZZ000000

9781853963056	European Union spatial policy and planning	Richard H. Williams		This is a book about the place of spatial policy within an integrated Europe. It takes the perspective 'l'Europe mon pays', rather than a specifically national view. It deals with the institutions, policy instruments and spatial planning, at the scale of Europe as a whole and of that of the European Union, and explains the logic behind them.  EU policies and programmes are already a familiar part of the working environment for professional planners and local planning authorities; for example the directive on the environmental assessment of projects, or the need to identify partners in other member states; or to join networks in order to participate in EU programmes; or to develop projects which qualify for ERDF or ESF grants. The Commission is increasingly recognized as part of the structure of government and network of government contacts, in the same way as national government departments.  To operate professionally in this context, to ‘think European' and to understand the implications of this policy context, as well as the continental spatial scale, presents a major challenge to all planners, students and planning educators. This book is written for those who need to know more about this new context. It is the product of the author's several years' experience of teaching EU spatial policy and the institutions responsible, to senior undergraduates and postgraduates.  The book is divided into four parts: Part One explains the powers and institutional structure of the EU. Part Two traces the emergence of a Europe-wide spatial policy, and describes the EU's role in regional, environmental, transport, and urban planning. Part Three deals with the practical aspects of operating professionally in Europe and Part Four reviews the prospects for further policy development in the context of the 1996 IGC.	1996	SAGE						ZZZ000000

9780761953821	EnGendering AIDS,deconstructing sex, text and epidemic	Tamsin Wilton		In an original and stimulating analysis of gender and AIDS, Tamsin Wilton assesses safer sex health promotion and health education discourse and considers their unintended consequences for the cultural construction of gender and sexuality. Taking a queer/feminist constructionist position, she links issues of power, gender, sexuality, and nationalism in an attempt to offer a sound theoretical foundation for an effective and radical HIV/AIDS health promotion strategy. EnGendering AIDS draws on safer sex materials from the USA, UK, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and Scandinavia and sets current practice against the historical context of VD/STD education, dissecting the role played by STDs in the cultural construction of gender. Wilton debates the meanings that erotic minorities read into bodies and desires, and how these have been transformed by AIDS, and suggests a new model of pornography that disengages the sexually explicit and/or erotically arousing from gendered power relations. EnGendering AIDS suggests a radically innovative approach to the development of effective safer sex promotional strategies based on new thinking in health promotion and on the insights of both radical feminism and queer theory. This book will be of interest to professionals in health promotion and health education, and also to students and academics in womenÆs studies, gender studies, lesbian and gay studies, sexuality, cultural studies, media studies, social policy, and medical sociology.	1997	Sage						ZZZ000000
