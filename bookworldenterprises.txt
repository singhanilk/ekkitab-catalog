9780415247788	Edward Said	Bill Ashcroft&D. Pal S. Ahluwalia		Edward Said is perhaps best known as the author ofOrientalism(1978), a book which changed the face of critical theory and shaped the emerging field of post-colonial studies. He is also widely known for his controversial journalism on the Palestinian political situation. This volume explains Said's key ideas, their contexts and impact, with reference to both his scholarship and journalism. These ideas include: * the place of text and critic in "the world" * knowledge, power and the construction of the "Other" * the links between culture and imperialism * exile, identity and the plight of Palestine. First published in 1999, this book has been fully updated and revised for the reader new to Said's work. The result is the ideal guide to one of today's most engaging critical thinkers.	2001	Routledge						ZZZ000000

9780500341964	Wright-sized houses,Frank Lloyd Wright's solutions for making small houses feel big	Diane Maddex		'Wright-Sized houses' is the first book to look specifically at the small houses Frank Lloyd Wright designed throughout his seventy-year career. This book presents a wealth of ideas for how to build or renovate a house to make it feel far more spacious than would seem possible. Lloyd Wright railed against unused parlours and basements and proposed combined living-dining areas. He built in furniture along the walls, used open plans that flowed around corners, dramatized high ceilings with eye-fooling details, turned solid walls into window walls, designed space-saving kitchens lighted by skylights, divided houses into ‘quiet’ and ‘living’ zones and embraced views of nature to add an outdoor ‘room’. He did away with bulky garages in favour of carports and experimented with prefabricated and build-it-yourself designs to help would-be homeowners stay within a budget. For readers looking for tips on making a small house feel big as well as for fans of Wright’s work of all kinds, 'Wright-Sized houses' offers a refreshing new window into why, even in the twenty-first century, he remains the last word in architects.	2003-11	Thames & Hudson						ZZZ000000

Questions for ReviewIndexWHAT THIS BOOK IS FORStudents have generally found biology a difficult subject to understand and learn. Despite the publication of hundreds of textbooks in this field, each one intended to provide an improvement over previous textbooks, students of biology continue to remain perplexed as a result of numerous subject areas that must be remembered and correlated when solving problems. Various interpretations of biology terms also contribute to the difficulties of mastering the subject.In a study of biology, REA found the following basic reasons underlying the inherent difficulties of biology:No systematic rules of analysis were ever developed to follow in a step-by-step manner to solve typically encountered problems. This results from numerous different conditions and principles involved in a problem that leads to many possible different solution methods. To prescribe a set of rules for each of the possible variations would involve an enormous number of additional steps, making this task more burdensome than solving the problem directly due to the expectation of much trial and error.Current textbooks normally explain a given principle in a few pages written by a biologist who has insight into the subject matter not shared by others. These explanations are often written in an abstract manner that causes confusion as to the principle's use and application. Explanations then are often not sufficiently detailed or extensive enough to make the reader aware of the wide range of applications and different aspects of the principle being studied. The numerous possible variations of principles and their applications are usually not discussed, and it is left to the reader to discover this while doing exercises. Accordingly, the average student is expected to rediscover that which has long been established and practiced, but not always published or adequately explained.The examples typically following the explanation of a topic are too few in number and too simple to enable the student to obtain a thorough grasp of the involved principles. The explanations do not provide sufficient basis to solve problems that may be assigned for homework or given on examinations.Poorly solved examples such as these can be presented in abbreviated form which leaves out much explanatory material between steps, and as a result requires the reader to figure out the missing information. This leaves the reader with an impression that the problems and even the subject are hard to learn - completely the opposite of what an example is supposed to do.Poor examples are often worded in a confusing or obscure way. They might not state the nature of the problem or they present a solution, which appears to have no direct relation to the problem. These problems usually offer an overly general discussion - never revealing how or what is to be solved.Many examples do not include accompanying diagrams or graphs, denying the reader the exposure necessary for drawing good diagrams and graphs. Such practice only strengthens understanding by simplifying and organizing biology processes.Students can learn the subject only by doing the exercises themselves and reviewing them in class, obtaining experience in applying the principles with their different ramifications.In doing the exercises by themselves, students find that they are required to devote considerable more time to biology than to other subjects, because they are uncertain with regard to the selection and application of the theorems and principles involved. It is also often necessary for students to discover those "tricks" not revealed in their texts (or review books) that make it possible to solve problems easily. Students must usually resort to methods of trial and error to discover these "tricks," therefore finding out that they may sometimes spend several hours to solve a single problem.When reviewing the exercises in classrooms, instructors usually request students to take turns in writing solutions on the boards and explaining them to the class. Students often find it difficult to explain in a manner that holds the interest of the class, and enables the remaining students to follow the material written on the boards. The remaining students in the class are thus too occupied with copying the material off the boards to follow the professor's explanations.This book is intended to aid students in biology overcome the difficulties described by supplying detailed illustrations of the solution methods that are usually not apparent to students. Solution methods are illustrated by problems that have been selected from those most often assigned for class work and given on examinations. The problems are arranged in order of complexity to enable students to learn and understand a particular topic by reviewing the problems in sequence. The problems are illustrated with detailed, step-by-step explanations, to save the students large amounts of time that is often needed to fill in the gaps that are usually found between steps of illustrations in textbooks or review/outline books.The staff of REA considers biology a subject that is best learned by allowing students to view the methods of analysis and solution techniques. This learning approach is similar to that practiced in various scientific laboratories, particularly in the medical fields.In using this book, students may review and study the illustrated problems at their own pace; students are not limited to the time such problems receive in the classroom.When students want to look up a particular type of problem and solution, they can readily locate it in the book by referring to the index that has been extensively prepared. It is also possible to locate a particular type of problem by glancing at just the material within the boxed portions. Each problem is numbered and surrounded by a heavy black border for speedy identification.	1978-12-31	Research & Education Assoc.						ZZZ000000

9780060580490	Rational exuberance,silencing the enemies of growth and why the future is better than you think	Michael J. Mandel		Michael J. Mandel, chief economist of BusinessWeek, is the country's most passionate partisan for exuberant economic growth. In the mid-1990s, he was one of the first journalists to use the term "New Economy" to describe the fast-growing but volatile U.S. economy, supercharged by technology and finance. Mandel's understanding of the true underpinnings of the 1990s economy led to his prescient warning that the Internet bubble was about to burst, which he predicted in his book The Coming Internet Depression. Now Mandel is issuing another warning. Without exuberant, technology-driven growth, the U.S. economy will lack the firepower to solve its social problems. Without breakthrough innovations like the internal combustion engine or the Internet, the U.S. economy simply can't create enough jobs or wealth to provide for its citizenry. Yet exuberant growth is stigmatized as immoral by some and bad public policy by others. And economists, surprisingly enough, are the biggest enemies of innovative, transformative growth. Mandel, a Ph.D. in economics himself, believes his colleagues in the dismal profession are a big part of the problem. Focusing on what he labels the single biggest failure in modern economics, Mandel blames New York Times columnist Paul Krugman, Nobel laureate Milton Friedman, and Greg Mankiw, President Bush's head of the Council of Economic Advisers, for misleading generations of students and slanting public policy against scientific innovation. Lively, opinionated, and controversial, Mandel's thinking will serve as a rallying cry for the creation of a new political coalition dedicated to economic growth. He calls on Silicon Valley to take their case to Washington, and to shift the debate from arguing about trade and budget deficits to solutions, such as more support for research, start-ups, and workforce training. Mandel is sure to kick-start that debate.	2004-05-11	HarperBusiness						ZZZ000000
9780849382161	Dictionary of marine natural products,with CD-ROM	John W. Blunt		Driven by the vast, yet largely unexplored, potential of bioactive organisms in the ocean and improvements in analytical techniques to facilitate their research, natural products scientists face an increasing need for single-source reference cataloging the current knowledge and state-of-the-science regarding marine natural products.Dictionary of Marine Natural Products with CD-ROM presents a comprehensive resource for more than 25,000 known natural products drawn from marine organisms.

The book draws on the rich history of innovation by inventors and entrepreneurs--ranging from the birth of typewriters to the emergence of personal computers, gas lamps to fluorescent lighting, George Eastman's amateur photography to electronic imaging--to develop a practical model for how innovation enters an industry, how mainstream firms typically respond, and how--over time--new and old players wrestle for dominance. Utterback asserts that existing organizations must consistently abandon past success and embrace innovation--even when it undermines their traditional strengths. He sets forth a strategy to do so, and identifies the responsibilities of managers to lead and focus that effort.

As John Mullins and Randy Komisar explain in Getting to Plan B, new businesses are fraught with uncertainty. To succeed, you must change the plan in real time as the inevitable challenges arise.

You'll discover strategies for:  Identifying the leap-of-faith assumptions hidden in your plan  Testing those assumptions and unearthing why the plan might not work  Reconfiguring the five components of your business model-revenue model, gross margin model, operating model, working capital model, and investment model-to create a sounder Plan B.

9781856690188	The French interior in the eighteenth century	John Whitehead		The eighteenth century was a period of great inventiveness and originality in French decorative arts and interior decoration, and its crowning achievement was the creation of the domestic interior. Using the craftsmen and skills originally brought into France from Italy and the Low Countries to serve the Sun King, French aristocrats and financiers created in their Paris Hotels and country chateaux interiors of an unprecedented elegance and sophistication. The same can be said of the works of art that completed these rooms - furniture decorated with marquetry or lacquer, gilt-bronzes, silver, the finest porcelain, of which none was finer than Sevres, tapestries and carpets from the Savonnerie, the Gobelins, Beauvais and Aubusson, and beautiful silks and upholstery. This book discusses in detail the creation and contents of many such interiors, including some that have never been photographed before. Using contemporary inventories, letters, and journals, it brings to life the tastes and preoccupations of their creators - the Royal family, the aristocracy, the fashionable tourists, and the nouveaux riches, the dealers and craftsmen who worked for them, the artists, designers, and architects, both in their public lives and more private moments. In addition it explores the wider context of the different styles of decoration, the effect upon them of changes in etiquette and social behavior, and the effect they had in turn upon the function and arrangement of rooms within the French interior.	1992	L.

9780007203017	Blaikie's Guide to Modern Manners	Thomas Blaikie		A witty yet practical short guide to modern manners that, like Lynne Truss, takes a subject often treated in a stuffy, high-handed way and deals with it lightly and humorously.Until recently, social conduct (as it was known), was illogical but easy. There were rules, and everybody knew and adhered to them. 'Don't hold your knife like a pen.' 'Offer to pass your neighbour the salt/ pepper/ water/ butter. Don't wait for them to ask.' 'When you have finished, leave your knife and fork at six o'clock/ four o'clock/ nine o'clock with the prongs of the fork turned up/ turned down.'Scarcely a trace remains now of this bizarre labyrinthine world of 'manners.' 'Come as you are,' we say, 'Be yourself.' But the age of emails and metrosexuality has thrown up a whole new set of social dilemmas. We don't know what to do. Our free-and-easy ways have left us in a vacuum of uncertainty and embarrassment.Take the nightmare of social kissing. How many times? In what order? Where? At what stage of an acquaintanceship? What about thanking? Do you have to thank at all? What do you do if a guest wants to smoke in your house? What do you wear to a dinner party? Do you have to bring a bottle? How do you deal with vegans?We just don't know how to behave any more. Something has got to be done, and Thomas Blaikie, author of You Look Awfully Like the Queen, is the man to do it. He'll tell you how to tip, how and when to 'drop in' on a friend, how to send condolences (is email good enough? will a text message do?), how to avoid being a party bore, how to react politely to flirtation from someone of the opposite sexual persuasion, and myriad other twenty-first-century social traumas.	2005-09-05	Fourth Estate						ZZZ000000

9781841697055	Intergroup relations,the role of motivation and emotion	Sabine Otten&Kai Sassenberg&Thomas Kessler		This volume gives a survey of the most recent developments and trends in intergroup research. Diverging from classical approaches that looked at diverse needs and motives (positive distinctiveness, belongingness, etc), the present book focuses not only on the question what motivates intergroup behaviour, but especially on how the motivation of intergroup behaviour functions.The book focuses on the role of emotion and motivation in the development of intergroup conflict, social exclusion, tolerance and other group related phenomena. The sections demonstrate how classical theories in the field have been further developed, enriched, and more sophisticatedly tested over the years, and summarise research on affect and memory. They also develop a group based self-regulation approach, examine several specific emotions as motivational forces of intergroup behaviour, and look at factors of intergroup relations that lead to social change.The chapters are short and easy-to-comprehend summaries referring to a broad range of original work, providing a useful resource for advanced students of Social Psychology and researchers in the field of intergroup relations.	2009-05-13	Psychology Press						ZZZ000000

9780199206650	Networks,An Introduction	Mark Newman		"The scientific study of networks, including computer networks, social networks, and biological networks, has received an enormous amount of interest in the last few years. The rise of the Internet and the wide availability of inexpensive computers have made it possible to gather and analyze network data on a large scale, and the development of a variety of new theoretical tools has allowed us to extract new knowledge from many different kinds of networks. The study of networks is broadly interdisciplinary and important developments have occurred in many fields, including mathematics, physics, computer and information sciences, biology, and the social sciences. This book brings together for the first time the most important breakthroughs in each of these fields and presents them in a coherent fashion, highlighting the strong interconnections between work in different areas. Subjects covered include the measurement and structure of networks in many branches of science, methods for analyzing network data, including methods developed in physics, statistics, and sociology, the fundamentals of graph theory, computer algorithms, and spectral methods, mathematical models of networks, including random graph models and generative models, and theories of dynamical processes taking place on networks"--	2010	Oxford University Press						ZZZ000000
9788190175876	Are You the Empress, Or the Devil, Or the Fool,or _ _? Know Your Tarot Birth Card	Deepika Tody		This does not give you any lessons on the practise of tarot but takes you on a path of self rediscovery. It presents a hitherto comparatively unexplored aspect of tarot and is interesting for the reader. The formula for calculating your birth tarot card is given inside the book.  According to zodiac there are twelve sun signs resulting in 12 kinds of personalities while I have found that tarot has 22 kinds of personalities because there are 22 birth cards. I have even given about the reverse manifestations that are possible in the life of a person. The book also suggests meditation to bring about a balance in personality.  Tarot birth cards start right from 0 to 21 each of them denoting a major arcane in tarot deck. It starts from the journey of the Fool and culminates into The World.  The book also tells you about the dominating element in your birth card. Your birth card uncovers your negative, positive and balancing qualities of your character. It shows us why we respond to a given situation in the way that we do. Everybody is always curious to know their own character traits.  The book is a product of comprehensive research and survey across cross sections of the society. It also helps you to understand the potential of other people better and then you can extract the best out of them. You can put the right people into the right slot once you are able to understand their special qualities. In my experience I have been able to use the birth card in such a way that my clients have been able to rebuild their relationships with their spouses, children and other relatives.  Never make the mistake of judging a person only by cover. The book cannot be hundred percent correct but at least if you know even eighty percent about someone it is easier than being totally ignorant.		Spenta						ZZZ000000

9781566766883	Wastewater Treatment Plants: Planning, Design, and Operation, Second Edition 	Syed R. Qasim	Hardback	Step-by-step procedures for planning, design, construction and operation: *Health and environment *Process improvements*Stormwater and combined sewer control and treatment*Effluent disposal and reuse*Biosolids disposal and reuse*On-site treatment and disposal of small flows*Wastewater treatment plants should be designed so that the effluent standards and reuse objectives, and biosolids regulations can be met with reasonable ease and cost. The design should incorporate flexibility for dealing with seasonal changes, as well as long-term changes in wastewater quality and future regulations. Good planning and design, therefore, must be based on five major steps: characterization of the raw wastewater quality and effluent, pre-design studies to develop alternative processes and selection of final process train, detailed design of the selected alternative, contraction, and operation and maintenance of the completed facility. Engineers, scientists, and financial analysts must utilize principles from a wide range of disciplines: engineering, chemistry, microbiology, geology, architecture, and economics to carry out the responsibilities of designing a wastewater treatment plant. The objective of this book is to present the technical and nontechnical issues that are most commonly addressed in the planning and design reports for wastewater treatment facilities prepared by practicing engineers. Topics discussed include facility planning, process description, process selection logic, mass balance calculations, design calculations, and concepts for equipment sizing. Theory, design, operation and maintenance, trouble shooting, equipment selection and specifications are integrated for each treatment process. Thus delineation of such information for use by students and practicing engineers is the main purpose of this book. 	1999	CRC Press	1,126	English				TEC010000

9781584886075	A Theoretical Introduction to Numerical Analysis 	Victor S. Ryaben'kii, Semyon V. Tsynkov 	Hardback	A Theoretical Introduction to Numerical Analysis presents the general methodology and principles of numerical analysis, illustrating these concepts using numerical methods from real analysis, linear algebra, and differential equations. The book focuses on how to efficiently represent mathematical models for computer-based study. An accessible yet rigorous mathematical introduction, this book provides a pedagogical account of the fundamentals of numerical analysis. The authors thoroughly explain basic concepts, such as discretization, error, efficiency, complexity, numerical stability, consistency, and convergence. The text also addresses more complex topics like intrinsic error limits and the effect of smoothness on the accuracy of approximation in the context of Chebyshev interpolation, Gaussian quadratures, and spectral methods for differential equations. Another advanced subject discussed, the method of difference potentials, employs discrete analogues of Calderons potentials and boundary projection operators. The authors often delineate various techniques through exercises that require further theoretical study or computer implementation. By lucidly presenting the central mathematical concepts of numerical methods, A Theoretical Introduction to Numerical Analysis provides a foundational link to more specialized computational work in fluid dynamics, acoustics, and electromagnetism. 	2007	Chapman and Hall	552	English	2 pounds	9.2 x 6.4 x 1.3 inches		MAT003000
