9788179928905	Timeless Thoughts for Today	Napoleon Hill, Judith Williamson	PaperBack	As a student of Dr. Hill for many years, I know that his philosophy works best when it is observable and measurable. This means that in order to achieve desired results, a simple two step process must be followed:Step 1: Thought + Step 2: Action = SuccessIt is not always easy to take action, but without action there is no success. Reflect on this for a moment. Great intentions never measure up to the smallest action. However, the tiniest action begins to build a momentum that culminates in your desired success if you build on the previous action daily.Napoleon Hills Timeless Thoughts for Today pairs Dr. Hills philosophy with actions that will move you toward success. I suggest that you try a few, keep a log, and watch your success rate grow. Without the action step, you are missing the master key to your dreams.First chart your course, next plan your method of travel, and third, step into the journey and begin! As you progress, you can then evaluate what actions work best for you. 	2008	Jaico Publishing House	184p	English			1	SEL000000

9788179926802	Path To Happiness & Prosperity	Neale Donald Walsch	PaperBack	On Abundance And Right LivelihoodEssentially, God tells us in Conversations with God that most of us do not understand what abundance really is. We confuse it with money. Yet when we take stock of that in which we truly are abundant, and choose to share it freely with everyone whose life we touch, we find that what we thought was abundancemoneycomes to us freely.Even this chain of events, however, many of us cannot accept. For when we think of money, we imagine that it is an experience and an energy that stands outside of the reality of God. Yet there is nothing in the universe that stands outside of the reality of God, that is not a part of God. Once we understand that money is a part of what God is, our attitude about money changes. We see it as an extension of the glory of God, not the root of all evil. This can produce astonishing results. 	2007	Jaico Publishing House	144p	English			1	ZZZ000000

8179923479	Upanishads For The Modern World	G.K.Pillai	PaperBack	In this book, Dr. Pillai relates the vision of the Upanishads to the spiritual needs of the 21st century. The stories of the Upanishads are retold to make them intelligible to the modern world. The outcome is a rational worldview that reveals the undeniable presence of an interactive energy in all forms of life.The Upanishads contain the essence of existential wisdom conceived by oriental mystics about 3,000 years ago. They lead us to the logical inference that the spark of universal energy embedded in us motivates all our worldly deeds and even inspires the spiritual quest to unravel the unknown. The Upanishads give us clear-cut answers to all ultimate questions that science fails to elucidate.The author suggests that the Upanishads can mitigate excessive violence, unfounded fears, and chronic anxieties that torment the modern mind. The book contains the latest scientific ideas on the mind and it offers effective spiritual solutions to remove undesirable aggressive tendencies. The existential wisdom explained here can hopefully create a compassionate mindset that we sadly miss in the egocentric era of information technology. 	2004	Jaico Publishing House	310p	English			1	ZZZ000000

But it contains all those colors in such synthesis, in such harmony, that they all disappear. They dissolve into oneness and that oneness is white. White represents the ultimate synthesis and harmony.And the lotus also is a great symbol, particularly in the East. The lotus represents the essential meaning of sannyas. The lotus lives in the lake and yet the water cannot touch it. it lives in the water and yet remains untouched by the water. The lotus represents the witnessing quality of your being: you live in the world, but you remain a witness. You remain in the world and yet you are not part of it. You participate and yet you are not part of it. You are in the world, but the world is not in you. When you become a calm and cool observer of life you are going to laugh -- not ordinarily laughter but a belly laughter like a lions roar. And white lotuses will start showering on you. 	2001	Jaico Publishing House	310p	English			1	ZZZ000000

It is a book about life and living: what life is for, who we are as human beings, why we are here. Yet it is death that forces these questions on us. If we could live forever, there would be little urgency in finding answers. But the fact is that whatever our age or the status of our health, none of us has time to waste in learning what life is for.We begin to take life seriously when we take death seriously. Otherwise, as Thoreau said, we run the risk of discovering, when we come to die, that we have never lived. This is not a negative observation. It is completely positive, for it brings life into focus. Every moment is precious. There is so little time: not a day to waste on quarreling with those we love, no time for anything that robs our lives of joy, hope, and meaning. Fulfilling the purpose of life becomes our overriding priority, and that brings joy, hope, love, and meaning to us and to those around us.

Scientists - most notably Professor Ian Stevenson, Director of the Division of Personality Studies at the Health Sciences Center at the University of Virginia - report on how their stories are then followed up to verify that the childrens memories are correct.Especially convincing are the cases of children born with missing limbs who are able to describe exactly where and when they lost these limbs in a past life.

Fest & Christian HerrendoerferMEIN KAMPF is perhaps the only notable work written in two volumes by Adolf Hitler, in 1924.

He was tried by the Peoples Court in Munich and subsequently, imprisoned for thirteen months where he wrote the first volume. The second volume was written after he was released.He was highly influenced by two people, who were apparently the main architects of his mental aberration. One was Dr. Leopold Potsch, who taught him German Political History, and the other was Dr. Jorg Lanz Van Liebenfels, a defrocked monk who founded the Temple of the New Order, and whose theories stated that the world belonged to the fair skinned and the superior Aryan race, and all others belonged to sub-human culture.Mein Kampf will give you an insight into one of the greatest evil geniuses of the last century; his political ideals, his beliefs and motivation, and his struggle to consolidate Germany into one great nation, and a Nazi-Third Reich.	2009	Jaico Publishing House	636p	English			1	ZZZ000000

8179925773	M.V. Kamath A Journalist At Large	M.V. Kamath, :c: Kalindi Randheri	PaperBack	M.V. Kamath, with four decades of rich and varied experiences, has traveled the world with an eye for people and a nose for news. He has met an amazingly wide range of characters from all walks of life  from royalty to Nobel laureates, from film and theatre personalities to statesmen and politicians. His meetings have resulted in this collection of anecdotes  some sad, some outright funny, and some simply staid. His writing in no way borders on gossip, but rather delves into the humanity of each subject. Journalism opened up vast avenues for M.V. Kamath. He lived a life of pleasant surprises, wondering what the next day held for him. The short pieces in this book are a minute collection of material that would probably fill up 10 such books. However, this collection powerfully conveys his experiences of pain and joy that run through all his encounters. He views both these universal experiences as ephemeral. This fleeting aspect of life binds each anecdote to the other, thus elevating story-telling to a fine art, that doesnt sound forced or acquired, and comes straight from the heart. 	2006	Jaico Publishing House	270p	English			1	ZZZ000000

Consistent risk methodology is now an essential tool for overcoming competitive pricing and for anticipating the consequences of market turbulence.It is now possible to calculate the potential impact of every major deal on the overall risk profit of the firm. Market risk and credit risk can be quantified and considered against the expected contribution to share-holder value or return on capital. These measurements create a theoretical framework for harmonizing activity at financial firms.In practice, todays markets and technologies evolve so rapidly that the requirements and the capabilities shift before any reengineering cycle can be completed. A quagmire of data seriously confounds the task of extracting reliable information for risk management. The data problem becomes acute when you move to global risk management, because a flaw anywhere affects the whole process and is much harder to trace. 	2004	Jaico Publishing House	296p	English			1	ZZZ000000

For many years, product and service marketers felt customers were there with them for life, and started taking brand loyalty for granted.

With this imaginary remote control, the consumer explores various brands only momentarily and evaluates them according to the perceived value he is getting. This is not to say that brand loyalty can no longer exist. However perceived value loyalty will precede brand loyalty. Only after a thorough assessment would a consumer settle for a particular brand. The author has recommended a unique way to gain, retain and regain consumers through his Brand Switch Module. Jagdeep Kapoors Brand Switch Module recommends strategies to convert, attract, increase, retain and reconvert customers leading to increased sales, market share and profits. 	2004	Jaico Publishing House	130p	English			1	ZZZ000000

9788179929261	The Art of Strategy	Ian Wilson	PaperBack	Strategy  and the planning that created it  has too often failed to deliver its promised results. The reasons for this failure are many and varied, but include an over-reliance on the next big thing in strategic methodology, a failure to recognize and deal with the total change that strategy requires in an organization, and an inability to deal with uncertainty. Wilson argues that strategy is a subtle and demanding art, far more than it is a science or a methodology. To succeed in dealing with complex, interacting forces inside and outside the organization, strategy must:  Deal with the totality of the organization in the context of its total environment (not just one function or one facet of the organization)  Learn to harness the power of opposites (the sometimes conflicting objectives of the organization, e.g., the long term and short term; vision and execution; economic constraints and social responsibility) Deal constructively with pervasive uncertainty in its future  Develop a strategic vision  Create a culture that fosters a strategic mindset throughout the organization. Without constant change and adaptation, a strategy will fail. Continuing success depends, therefore, upon constant learning from customers, competitors, changes in our environment, and our own mistakes.	2008	Jaico Publishing House	192p	English			1	ZZZ000000

9788179927588	International Business And Culture	:e: Kip Becker	PaperBack	International Business And Culture is a book devoted to the effects of culture on international business operations. Many costly errors have been made by international businesses that have not realized the extent to which the needs and behaviors of consumers and employees vary among regions and nations. Change has created many conflicts between the established ways and the introduction of new ideas and different behaviors. As firms further their internationalization efforts more and more employees will find that they are being exposed to greater cultural diversity. This is increasingly the case due to efforts to expand hiring of indigenous persons to staff foreign locations. Often new managers from foreign subsidiaries are provided training in the domestic offices exposing not only them, but also those around them, to different ways of thinking. This internationalization of the workplace has placed increased pressures on human resource departments, managers and staff. As such, companies will find it increasingly difficult to respond to differing languages, values and perceptions in a manner that maximizes diverse personal qualities and achieves company goals. As Internet use, international travel and communication speed all increase it is certainly reasonable to assume that the velocity at which cultures collide will increase as well.

9788179929087	Theory of Constraints	S.K. Mukhopadhyay	PaperBack	Theory Of Constraints (TOC) deals with change for the better and how best to bring about this change. TOC also recognises the output of any system comprising multiple processes, where the output of one such process depends on the output of one or more previous processes and is limited by the least productive process. TOC sermonises that the goal is making money at present, and for the future. Here, future is as important as present.Although the profit-earning capability of an industry and business would have to be in the driving seat, the means around market and business as a whole were not so complex. These intricacies took an enormous turn during the last two decades, when competition became fierce and globalisation started to dictate the market. Professionals opened their eyes. There was only one buzzword  improve, and make it a continuous process.The book is oriented towards achieving goals starting from the inception of the thinking process as TOC ascribes. The book also provides a thorough insight of managing business even when there are constraints and resolving those by logical thinking. The book is also unique in that it provides the method of initialisation of the thinking process  a dominant feature of TOC.	2008	Jaico Publishing House	228p	English			1	ZZZ000000

9788179927441	Benchmarks in Hospitality & Tourism	:e: Sungsoo Pyo	PaperBack	The use of benchmarking in the tourism industry has been very limited and is still in its infancy. It has been restricted to the study of operational units and businesses, rather than destinations. The limited number of benchmarking studies carried out within the tourism industry, and almost all of the benchmarking studies, have been conducted by external third parties. It is apparent that the benchmarking model needs further development. To date, there have been far more conceptual works on why benchmarking is important and how to operationalize it than empirical research focusing on methodological issues such as how to measure performance gaps. Most empirical studies are based upon the supply side but avoiding the demand side. This collection fills some of the gap.Eight studies are included in this book. One paper is about overview of the benchmarking literature, and one paper deals with tourism. Others are concentrated in the hospitality business. Two studies deal with the environmental perspectives. 	2008	Jaico Publishing House	172p	English			1	ZZZ000000

8172248172	The Theory and Practice of Managerial Ethics	Jayashree Sadri, Sorab Sadri & Dhun Dastoor	PaperBack	This is the age of the intellect where every manager has to thrive on the cutting edge of global competition.

Ethics has to be both willed and desired before it is actualised. This book adds intellectual muscle to that belief. The authors have neither relied on spiritualism nor collected facts without first building a sound theoretical base in the philosophy of social sciences.Largely, this book is distinctly different from the other books on the subject since it is a product of empirical research and gives a direction to future scholars as well. More importantly, this book explicitly symbolises what the three authors stand for and has a fair degree of originality in this is what they have to say. It uses twenty-six case studies culled from social reality to enforce the authors argument. Hence it will have a greater appeal not only to the research scholar and those academia standing behind the lectern in a postgraduate classroom in a B-School but to every sociologist, psychologist and economist who is interested in ethics and human behaviour in Indian organisations. Every manager must have a copy of this book on his/her bookshelf. 	2008	Jaico Publishing House	518p	English			1	ZZZ000000

8179921662	Handbook for Scientists & Engineers	Elart von Collani & Klaus Drager	HardBound	Handbook for Scientists & Engineers is a new reference book that deals with estimating and testing a proportion or the probability of an event. The purpose of the book is twofold: it aims at providing practitioners with refined and easy-to-use techniques as well as initiating a new field of research in theoretical statistics. The book contains completely new interval and point estimators as well as test procedures that are superior to the traditional ones.This is especially true in the case of small and medium-sized samples, which are characteristic for many fields of application. The procedures are derived for fixed and bounded parameter ranges, thus allowing the selection of a method tailored to a given situation. Thus, according to the size of the proportion or probability of interest different estimators should be used, similar to the case of measuring length, where the measurement method depends heavily on the size of the length to be measured. The approach yields more precise estimators and more powerful tests. It may also be applied to other estimation or test problems. 	2004	Jaico Publishing House	396p	English			1	ZZZ000000

8179926427	Bioinformatics	Kenneth Baclawski & Tianhua Niu	HardBound	Recent advances in biotechnology, spurred by the Human Genome Project, have resulted in the accumulation of vast amounts of new data. Ontologies  computer-readable, precise formulations of concepts (and the relationship among them) in a given field  are a critical framework for coping with the exponential growth of valuable biological data generated by high-output technologies. This book introduces the key concepts and applications of ontologies and ontology languages in bioinformatics and will be an essential guide for bioinformaticists, computer scientists, and life science researchers.The three parts of Ontologies for Bioinformatics ask, and answer, three pivotal questions: what ontologies are; how ontologies are used; and what ontologies could be (which focuses on how ontologies could be used for reasoning with uncertainty). The authors first introduce the notion of an ontology, from hierarchically organized ontologies to more general network organizations, and survey the best-known ontologies in biology and medicine. They show how to construct and use ontologies, classifying uses into three categories: querying, viewing, and transforming data to serve diverse purposes. Contrasting deductive, or Boolean, logic with inductive reasoning, they describe the goal of a synthesis that supports both styles of reasoning. They discuss Bayesian networks as a way of expressing uncertainty, describe data fusion, and propose that the World Wide Web can be extended to support reasoning with uncertainty. They call this inductive reasoning web the Bayesian web.	2006	Jaico Publishing House	440p	English			1	ZZZ000000

Can gold nanoparticles bond with  and destroy  cancer cells? Will gargantuan elevators lift satellites to their orbits? The possibilities for the not-too-distant future are astounding. But nanotech is already real: It makes tennis balls last longer. It makes paints and coatings stick better. It makes pants impervious to coffee spills. Its made car tires stronger for decades. And in 2003, President Bush signed the 21st Century Nanotechnology Research and Development Act, a $3.7 billion grant that represents the largest federally funded science initiative since President Kennedy established the space program. 	2006	Jaico Publishing House	320p	English			1	ZZZ000000
