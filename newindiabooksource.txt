Doctors Angela and David Wilson believe they have found personal and professional bliss when they opt to leave the university medical center for Bartlet Community Hospital, a modern, state-of-the-art medical facility in scenic Bartlet, Vermont. For Angela, a pathologist, and David, an internist/primary-care physician, Bartlet seems to be a dream come true: a town with green lawns and crystal lakes that is an idyllic haven from urban crime and pollution; a chance for a home of their own and a resurgence of romance in their relationship; a perfect environment for their eight-year-old daughter, Nikki, who suffers from cystic fibrosis; and the opportunity to work within an enlightened system of "managed care." But all is not what it seems. After a resplendent fall, a stark landscape looms in Bartlet that reveals more than the skeletons of the trees. Gradually at first and then at a quickening pace, the Wilsons' earthly Nirvana disintegrates as mysterious, unexplained deaths become more than coincidences. The deadly nightmare of their life threatens them all, even Nikki, the most vulnerable. Fighting for their careers as well as for the very survival of their family, Angela and David must conquer the evil that confronts each of them before they are consumed by the horror.

9780330487870	Effective Strategic Leadership,An Essential Path to Success Guided by the World's Greatest Leaders	John Adair		With the rapid trend away from management to business leadership, there is a need for a new, broader understanding of leadership. This clear and authoritative guide answers the questions, 'what is strategic leadership?', 'what makes a person effective as a strategic leader?' and 'how can I develop my abilities as a leader?' The concept of leadership is relevant not only to organisational life but to all of us: everyone has to 'lead' their own life. To be a strategic life-leader means developing a vision and direction for one's life, identifying personal core values and fostering an informal team among colleagues and associates. 'Effective Strategic Leadership' is as important for unstructured careers as it is in large companies or organisations.	2003	Pan						ZZZ000000

9780006380726	The honourable company,a history of the English East India Company	John Keay		During 200 years the East India Company grew from a loose association of Elizabethan tradesmen into "the grandest society of merchants in the universe". As a commercial enterprise it came to control half the world's trade and as a political entity it administered an embryonic empire. Without it there would have been no British India and no British Empire. In a tapestry ranging from Southern Africa to north-west America, and from the reign of Elizabeth I to that of Victoria, bizarre locations and roguish personality abound. From Bombay to Singapore and Hong Kong the political geography of today is, in some respects, the result of the Company.

Why do we get embarrassed, and why does embarrassment make us blush? These, and many other questions about the emotional life of man and animals are answered in this remarkable book. The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals was an immediate best-seller when it was first published in 1872 and still provides the point of departure for research into emotion and facial expression. In his study of infants and children (including a delightfully objective study of his own baby's smiles and pouts), of the insane, of painting and sculpture, of cats and dogs and monkeys, and of the ways that people in different cultures express their feelings, Darwin's insights have not been improved upon by modern science. This definitive edition contains a substantial new Introduction and Afterword by Paul Ekman. Ekman also provides commentaries that use the latest scientific knowledge to elaborate, support and occasionally challenge Darwin's insights.	1999	Fontana						ZZZ000000

9780007150625	The English Civil War,A People's History	Diane Purkiss		A remarkable popular history of the English Civil War, from the perspectives of those involved in this most significant turning point in British history. This compelling history, culminating in the execution of Charles I, brings to life the people who fought in it, died in it, and in doing so changed the history of the world forever. In an excitingly fresh approach to the period Diane Purkiss tells the story of this critical era not just in terms of the battle of ideas, but as the histories of the people who conceived them. 'The English Civil War' builds a gripping narrative of the individuals involved and their motives, from those whose reputations were made on the back of this violent and brutal war, such as Oliver Cromwell and Lady Eleanor Davies, to witchfinders and revolutionaries; and ultimately, the ordinary men who fought and the women who lived with tragedy, finding their political voice for the first time. The consequences of ten years of bloody revolution were to stretch from the cities to the villages to the grand houses, form Ulster to East Anglia to the outer reaches of Cornwall. The tales uncovered by Diane Purkiss paint a picture of a world turned upside down, where madness and prophesy play their part, and where normal life and times are suspended. This important book uncovers forgotten lives and illustrates incisively the critical contribution of this extraordinary period in English history to contemporary politics and society.	2007-02-22	HarperPerennial						ZZZ000000

This is a triumphant conclusion to the outstanding Emperor series.	2006	Harpercollins						ZZZ000000

9780007175758	Calcio,A History of Italian Football	John Foot		The first history of Italian football to be written in English, 'Calcio' is a mix of serious analysis and comic storytelling, with vivid descriptions of games, goals, dives, missed penalties, riots and scandals in the richest and toughest league in the world.'Calcio' tells the story of Italian football from its origins in the 1890's to the present day. It takes us through a history of great players and teams, of style, passion and success, but also of violence, cynicism, catenaccio tactics and corruption.We meet the personalities that have shaped this history - from the Italian heroes to the foreigners that failed, the model professionals to the mavericks. 'Calcio' evokes the triumphs (the 1982 World Cup victory) and the tragedies (Meroni, the 'Italian George Best', killed by his number one fan), set against a backdrop of paranoia and intrigue, in a country where the referee is seen as corrupt until proven otherwise.Calcio is no longer a game. It is sometimes difficult to define it as a sport. It is certainly big business and a fanatical civic religion. There is no moral code here. Winners are always right, losers always wrong. This history of Italian football reveals all about the richest and toughest league in the world.	2007-09-13	Harper Perennial						ZZZ000000

9780007183135	Stumbling on happiness	Daniel Gilbert		In this fascinating and often hilarious work, pre-eminent psychologist Daniel Gilbert shows how ' and why ' the majority of us have no idea how to make ourselves happy. The drive for happiness is one of the most instinctive and fundamental human impulses ' but do we actually have the first idea how to achieve it, maintain it, or even, for that matter, what it is? In this revealing and witty investigation, pioneering psychologist Daniel Gilbert uses his ground-breaking research, philosophy and real-life case studies to illustrate how our basic drive to satisfy our desires is not only often misguided, but also intrinsically linked to some of the most long-standing and contentious questions about human nature. Combining lively prose, fresh analysis, much-awaited findings and considerable erudition, 'Stumbling On Happiness' is a fascinating and engaging look at what it means to be a human being on a perennial quest for happiness.	2007-02-05	Harper Perennial						ZZZ000000
9780007189861	Bomber boys,fighting back, 1940-1945	Patrick Bishop&Patrick Joseph Bishop		Following on from his best-selling 'Fighter Boys', in this very different book, Patrick Bishop looks back at the lives, human realities and the extraordinary risks that the painfully young pilots took during the strategic air-offensive against Germany from 1939-1945.In 'Fighter Boys', Patrick Bishop brought to life the pilots who flew Spitfires throughout the summer of 1940, the men who fought and won the Battle of Britain, saving the nation from German invasion. His story in this, his new book, is very different. Unlike the Battle of Britain, there was nothing romantic about bombing German cities, and, after the war, the crews became a political embarrassment. Their huge losses were overlooked and their courage obscured by a controversy that still rages over the morality of their actions.The prospect for survival for a Bomber Command flier was slim. They flew, mostly without complaint, because they were told their efforts were critical to the success of the war effort, their bombs falling on armaments factories, or railway lines. In fact, their bombs killed and maimed thousands of civilian casualties, an unavoidable fact of war as viewed by their military and political masters. The fliers were amongst Britain's brightest and best. Often barely out of childhood, they lived for months at a time in damp Nissan huts, flying night after night from the windswept airbases in the east of England to drop bombs on Berlin, or the Ruhr valley, or Brussels, facing a deadly prospect every time the planes took off. Tours were for 30 operations. With a life expectancy shorter than an infantry soldier on the Somme in 1916, most didn't make it to the end, dying in flaming balls of steel as they exploded at 20,000 feet above enemy territory.This book seeks to place the emphasis back on the men who fought aggressively and with extraordinary courage, comradeship and fortitude. It is a brilliant work of history that reminds us of the generation who dealt in death whilst trying with all their might to cheat it. Who drank, and laughed, and played cards during the day, before taking off at night on their deadly and terrifying missions. A generation who didn't dare think about that mystical thing called a 'future' until the war was won.	2007-07	HarperPress						ZZZ000000
9780007190263	Oystercatchers	Susan Fletcher		The second novel from highly acclaimed young writer Susan Fletcher, author of the award-winning a??Eve Greena?? Amy lies in a coma. Her older sister, Moira, comes to her in the evenings, sits beside her in a green-walled hospital room. Here, Moira confesses. She admits to her childhood selfishness which deeply hurt her family and to the self-imposed exile from the dramatic Welsh coast that had dominated and captivated her childhood; to her savagery at boarding school; to the wild, bitter and destructive heart that she carried into her adult life. Moira knows this: that she's been a poor daughter, and a deceptive wife. But it is as Amy lies half-dying that she sees the real truth: she's been a cruel sister, and it is this cruelty that has led them both here, to this hospital bed. A novel about trust, loss and loneliness, a??Oystercatchersa?? is a love story with a profound darkness at its core.	2008-01-10	Harper Perennial						FIC000000

9780007194599	The Intention Experiment,Use Your Thoughts to Change the World	Lynne McTaggart		Ever wondered if your intentions, prayers or wishes have a real, calculable effect on the world? Here, from Lynne McTaggart, groundbreaking author of a??The Fielda??, comes riveting accounts of scientific investigations and real case histories with evidence that we are all connected and our intentions can be harnessed as a collective force for good. For the last 40 years renegade scientists, experimenting with the limits of quantum physics, have made seemingly impossible discoveries. 1966: a lie-detector expert accidentally discovers that plants can read thoughts. 1982: meditating Buddhist monks in the Himalayas turn their bodies into a human furnace. 1994: a psychologist's experiments reveal a stream of light flowing from healers during healing. These events form part of an extraordinary scientific story and revolutionary discovery - that thought is a thing that affects other things. In The Intention Experiment, Lynne McTaggart, author of the international bestseller The Field, joins forces with a team of international, renowned scientists to test the effects of focused group intention on scientifically quantifiable targets - animal, plant and human. The Intention Experiment is a truly revolutionary book that invites you, the reader, to take part in the greatest intention experiment in history. The results of McTaggart's 'global laboratory' started with the focused intention that made a geranium leaf glow to evidence to show that group intention is powerful enough to affect targets more than 5000 miles away and may even affect global warming. These remarkable results prove human thought and intention has the power to focus our lives, heal our illnesses, clean up our communities and improve the planet. This book also shows you how to harness that power to make changes in your own life.	2008-01-07	HarperCollins Publishers Limited						ZZZ000000
9780007195114	The Other Side of Israel,My Journey Across the Jewish/Arab Divide	Susan Nathan		The pioneering autobiographical story of a British Zionist in her fifties who moves to Israel and chooses to live among 25,000 Muslims in the all-Arab Israeli town of Tamra, a few miles from Nazareth.Susan Nathan's revelatory book about her new life across the ethnic divide in Israel is already creating international interest. At a time when Middle Eastern politics (in many ways central to the current world disorder) have become mired in endless tit-for-tat killings, Susan Nathan is showing - by her own daily example - that it is perfectly possible for Jews and Arabs to live peacefully together in a single community, recognising their common humanity.The author's familiarity with the former injustices of apartheid South Africa enables her to draw telling comparisons with the state of Israel. The increasing segregation of, and disinclination against, the million-strong Arabic population of Israel is something she witnesses at first hand, but in describing her experiences in Tamra she is as observant of Arab frailties as of Jewish oppression.Written with warmth, compassion and humour, 'The Other Side of Israel' is one courageous woman's positive life-enhancing response to a situation in which entrenched attitudes lead only to more violence and bloodshed.	2006-06-30	Harper Perennial						ZZZ000000
9780007195756	Sacred causes,religion and politics from the European dictators to Al Qaeda	Michael Burleigh		Populated by many of the most iconic figures of the twentieth-century, Sacred Causes provides a brilliant examination of how religion has shaped twentieth-century Europe from the Great War until the modern-day War on Terror.Beginning with the chaotic post-World War I landscape in which religious belief was one way of reordering a world knocked off its axis, Sacred Causes is a sweepingly assured critique of how religion has often been camouflaged by politics. Covering a vast canvas, Burleigh examines the many 'secular' religions the twentieth-century produced, analysing how successive totalitarian leaders fantasised and aped the hierarchy, rites and ritual of the churches in the desire to return to the day where ruler and deity were one.All the many bloody regimes and movements of the century are here, from Stalin's Soviet Union, Hitler's Germany, Mussolini's Italy, Franco's Spain through to the modern scourge of terrorism the current 'War on Terror'. Often blackly comic, the book shows how the church has been swayed by and contributed to conflicting secular currents. He traces religious beliefs and institutions from a time when the church, disenchanted with both democracy and fascism, began to search for political alternatives. During the Second World War, the churches faced agonising dilemmas, notably how to respond to the Holocaust.Combining the deeper workings of history with an urgent sense of the contemporary relevance of his material, Burleigh challenges his readers to consider why no-one foresaw the religious implications of massive Third World immigration, as well as what is driving current calls for a 'civic religion' with which to counter the terrorist threats which have so shocked the West.	2007	Harper Perennial						ZZZ000000
9780007197323	Going Dutch,how England plundered Holland's glory	Lisa Jardine		A fascinating exploration of the relationship of competition and assimilation between England and the Netherlands during the 17th century, revealing how Dutch tolerance, resilience and commercial acumen effectively conquered England by permanently reshaping the intellectual landscape long before Dutch monarchs sat on the English throne. Working backwards from the bloodless revolution that set William and Mary of Orange on the English throne in 1688, this bold and ambitious work redefines the history of cultural and commercial interconnection between two of the worlda??s most powerful trading empires at a time of great intellectual and geographical discovery. Weaving together the lives of the great thinkers of the time, Jardine demonstrates how individuals such as Anton van Leeuwenhoek, Christiaan Huygens and Margaret Cavendish, usually depicted as instances of isolated genius, in fact evolved within a context of easy Anglo-Dutch exchange that laid the groundwork for the European Enlightenment and the Scientific Revolution. This fascinating history of big ideas and remarkable individuals denounces the traditional view that the rise of England as a world power took place at the expense of the Dutch, asserting instead that what is usually interpreted as the decline of the Dutch trading empire was in fact a a??passing ona?? of the baton to an England expanding in power and influence. In so doing, Jardine not only challenges traditional interpretations of the role of the British Empire in Enlightenment Europe, but also raises probing questions about the position in which post-Empire Britain finds itself today.	2008	HarperPress						ZZZ000000
9780007198498	Dermaphoria	Craig Clevenger		Clandestine chemistry and the LA underworld provide the atmosphere for this kaleidoscopic tale of lost memories and the heartbreak of finding them, from the author of 'The Contortionist's Handbook'. When Eric Ashworth wakes in jail, he has no idea how he got there, or why. His only memory is a woman's name: Desiree. Released on bail and holed up in a low-rent motel, Eric starts to piece together his former life as a chemist at the centre of a desert drug ring with the help of a powerful new hallucinogen which simultaneously loosens his grip on the present. As the events of his past begin to emerge from the confusion of his fragmented memory, Eric must contend with a gnawing paranoia and the need for ever-increasing fixes - not to mention disturbing visits from an intimidating police detective, his former associate Manhattan White and the ominously named Toe Tag. As his grip on reality becomes more tenuous, past and present, reality and fantasy begin to bleed into each other, bringing this visceral, shifting novel of love and loss to its climax.	2007	Harper Perennial						ZZZ000000

9780007205226	Letters from Father Christmas	J. R. R. Tolkien		Paperback edition of Tolkien's famous illustrated letters from Father Christmas includes extracts and pictures not included 25 years ago in the original publication. Every December an envelope bearing a stamp from the North Pole would arrive for J.R.R.Tolkien's children. Inside would be a letter in strange spidery handwriting and a beautiful coloured drawing or some sketches. The letters were from Father Christmas. They told wonderful tales of life at the North Pole: how all the reindeer got loose and scattered presents all over the place; how the accident-prone Polar Bear climbed the North Pole and fell through the roof of Father Christmas's house into the dining-room; how he broke the Moon into four pieces and made the Man in it fall into the back garden; how there were wars with the troublesome horde of goblins who lived in the caves beneath the house! Sometimes the Polar Bear would scrawl a note, and sometimes Ilbereth the Elf would write in his elegant flowing script, adding yet more life and humour to the stories. No reader, young or old, can fail to be charmed by the inventiveness and 'authenticity' of Tolkien's Letters from Father Christmas. 'Letters from Father Christmas' has been reformatted into an attractive and affordable new paperback format, with the inclusion of every one of the delightful letters and pictures that Tolkien sent to his children.	2006	HarperCollins						ZZZ000000

9780007207459	Knights of the Black and White	Jack Whyte		The exciting first book in a brand new fictional trilogy about the most important events in the history of the Order of the Knights Templar. The Templars represent a widely popular period of history, but the roots of their fellowship have been shrouded in contemporary conspiracy theory and media glamour....this trilogy tells the true tales of the Knights Templar; beginning with why they formed after the First Crusade and why they continued to grow in power and influence. Immediately after the deliverance of Jerusalem, the Crusaders, considering their vow fulfilled, drifted back to their homes. But some considered that the defence of this precarious conquest, surrounded as it was by Mohammedan neighbours, still remained. In 1118, during the reign of Baldwin II, Hugues de Payens, a knight of Champagne, and eight of his companions bound themselves by a perpetual vow, taken in the presence of the Patriarch of Jerusalem, to defend the Christian kingdom and all god fearing pilgrims who wished to visit the Holy Land. Baldwin accepted their services and assigned them a portion of his palace, adjoining the temple of the city; hence their title "pauvres chevaliers du temple" (Poor Knights of the Temple).	2007-10-01	Harper						FIC014000

Yet an accidental playground 'bump' would release a rage frightening to behold.

Best known as the creator of Hercule Poirot and Miss Jane Marple, her prolific output would bring her publisher William Collins at least one book every year. Twenty of her contemporary crime novels were to feature neither Poirot or Marple, instead a wide range of ingenious plots would be played out by a selection of amateur sleuths, professional detectives, young adventuresses or unwary bystanders caught up in unforeseen events.This collection of five omnibuses gathers together the twenty stand-alone novels, presenting them chronologically and providing a fascinating window on a changing world though six decades of investigation. Presented in this way, recurring characters - including Superintendent Battle, Tommy and Tuppence Beresford, Colonel Johnny Race and Ariadne Oliver - rub shoulders with many who would appear only in one book, and the result is a selection of some of the finest mystery writing ever. Here is the answer to the question of what Agatha Christie might have been had she not invented Poirot or Marple - and the answer undoubtedly is still The Queen of Crime!	2006	HarperCollins						FIC022000

Best known as the creator of Hercule Poirot and Miss Marple, Agatha tirelessly provided her publisher with at least one book every year, and twenty of her contemporary crime novels were to feature neither Poirot nor Marple. Instead a wide range of ingenious plots would be played out by a selection of amateur sleuths, professional detectives, young adventuresses or unwary bystanders caught up in unforeseen events.

"The volume's four stories are: Endless Night - a local curse casts a grim shadow over a young man's ambition to build a house on a lonely plot of land; By the Pricking of My Thumbs - an old woman's ramblings about something buried behind a fireplace leads two ageing detectives into real danger; Passenger to Frankfurt - a mystery woman's warning that someone is trying to kill her sets a diplomat up against an invisible enemy; and Postern of Fate - a message hidden inside an old book could be the key to solving a nasty case of poisoning many years ago."--BOOK JACKET.	2006	HarperCollins						ZZZ000000
9780007209057	Six Degrees,Our Future on a Hotter Planet	Mark Lynas		An eye-opening and vital account of the future of our earth, and our civilisation, if current rates of global warming persist, by the highly acclaimed author of a??High Tidea??. Picture yourself a few decades from now, in a world in which average temperatures are three degrees higher than they are now. On the edge of Greenland, rivers ten times the size of the Amazon are gushing off the ice sheet into the north Atlantic. Displaced victims of North Africa's drought establish a new colony on Greenland's southern tip, one of the few inhabitable areas not already crowded with environmental refugees. Vast pumping systems keep the water out of most of Holland, but the residents of Bangladesh and the Nile Delta enjoy no such protection. Meanwhile, in New York, a Category 5-plus superstorm pushes through the narrows between Staten Island and Brooklyn, devastating waterside areas from Long Island to Manhattan. Pakistan, crippled by drought brought on by disappearing Himalayan glaciers, sees 27 million farmers flee to refugee camps in neighbouring India. Its desperate government prepares a last-ditch attempt to increase the flow of the Indus river by bombing half-constructed Indian dams in Kashmir. The Pakistani president authorises the use of nuclear weapons in the case of an Indian military counter-strike. But the biggest story of all comes from South America, where a conflagration of truly epic proportions has begun to consume the Amazona?| Alien as it all sounds, Mark Lynas's incredible new book is not science-fiction; nor is it sensationalist. The title, a??Six Degreesa??, refers to the terrifying possibility that average temperatures will rise by up to six degrees within the next hundred years. This is the first time we have had a reliable picture of how the collapse of our civilisation will unfold unless urgent action is taken. Most vitally, Lynas's book serves to highlight the fact that the world of 2100 doesn't have to be one of horror and chaos. With a little foresight, some intelligent strategic planning, and a reasonable dose of good luck, we can at least halt the catastrophic trend into which we have fallen a?? but the time to act is now.	2008-02-21	Harper Perennial						ZZZ000000

9780007212859	Dusty Warriors,Modern Soldiers at War	Richard Holmes		Our foremost military historian offers us a compelling and at times terrifying account of what it means to be a contemporary soldier. In this remarkable book, Richard Holmes draws on the testimonies of the 700 soldiers of the Princess of Wales Royal Regiment to capture in vivid detail the average soldier's day-to-day experience of war. Embroiled in a conflict often too dangerous for reporters to cover, these soldiers - most of them young, many without any previous experience of warfare - have kept ongoing records of the drudgery, anxiety and horror involved in fighting a violent and increasingly unpopular war against a ruthless and resourceful enemy. All have risked their lives, and many have died. Others have been recognised and awarded for their courage, resourcefulness and gallantry - Private Johnson Beharry recently became the first man to be awarded the Victoria Cross in 23 years. With these intimate and revealing glimpses of life in the modern army, Richard Holmes paints a sweeping portrait of a new generation of soldiers - grunts, gallants and heroes - and the sacrifices their decision to fight for their country entails.	2007	Harper Perennial						ZZZ000000

9780007213573	Grievance	Marguerite Alexander		A moving novel about the relationships within families and between friends, told through the touching story of a young woman starting out on a new life in London, on a quest to escape the claustrophobia of her small hometown. Nora Doyle, a young Irish girl, has come to university in London. The promise of a loving and idyllic childhood was brutally cut short when she was forced to assume the responsibility of looking after her Downs syndrome brother while her parents, devastated by his birth, retreated into their collapsed lives. Only Nora gave her brother the love, care and attention he needed, but she had to endure the watchful eye of her bullying, dogmatic father and the resentment of her crushed, self-pitying mother. To escape the small-town claustrophobia of a Northern Ireland battered by political and religious divisions, Nora begins a new life in London. But instead of finding friends and caring adults to make up for her own lack of parental love and normal family life, she unwittingly becomes the obsession of her narcissistic lecturer and finds it hard to connect with her peers. Too late she realises that she can escape from her family, but her behaviour and relationships with those around her continue to be shaped by her upbringing. Written with sensitivity and a rare emotional insight, this is a richly woven story about how we make connections and what it is that severs them.	2007	Harper Perennial						ZZZ000000
9780007213702	Beethoven,the universal composer	Edmund Morris		Pulitzer-prize winning biographer Edmund Morris interweaves the personal history of the world's most famous composer with an insightful exploration of the way Beethoven's life was reflected and embodied in his genius and his music. Eminent Lives is an exciting and groundbreaking series that pairs great biographers, historians and novelists with iconic subjects, building on a biographical tradition that can be traced back to Aubrey's 'Brief Lives', Dr Johnson's 'Lives of the Poets' and Lytton Strachey's 'Eminent Victorians'. 'To preserve a becoming brevity which excludes everything that is redundant and nothing that is significant,' wrote Strachey. 'That, surely, is the first duty of the biographer.' Edmund Morris, the author of three bestselling presidential biographies and a lifelong devotee of Beethoven, brings the great composer to life as a man of astonishing complexity and overpowering intelligence. A gigantic, compulsively creative personality unable to tolerate constraints, he was not so much a social rebel as an astute manipulator of the most powerful and privileged aristocrats in Germany and Austria, at a time when their world was threatened by the rise of Napoleon Bonaparte. But Beethoven's achievement rests in his immortal music. Struggling against progressive, incurable deafness (which he desperately tried to keep secret), he nonetheless produced towering masterpieces, such as his iconic Fifth and Ninth symphonies. With sensitivity and insight, Edmund Morris illuminates Beethoven's life, including his interactions with the women he privately lusted for but held at bay, and his work, whose grandeur and beauty were conceived 'on the other side of silence.'	2007-03-05	HarperPress						ZZZ000000

9780007221752	Ad infinitum,a biography of Latin	Nicholas Ostler		A detailed and in-depth biography of the Latin language from its very beginnings to the present day from the widely acclaimed author of 'Empires of the Word'. The Latin language has been a constant in the cultural history of the West for over two millennia. It has shaped the way we think of ourselves and of our (central) place in the world. It has formed and united us as Europeans, has been the foundation of our education for centuries and defined the way in which we express our thoughts, our faith and our knowledge of the workings of the world. And yet, Latin began life as the cumbersome dialect of a small southern Italian city-state. Its active use lasted three times as long as Rome's Empire and its use echoes on in the law codes of half the world, in terminologies of biology and medicine, and until forty years ago in the litany of the Catholic Church, the most populous form of Christianity. In 'Ad Infinitum', Nicholas Ostler examines the reasons why Latin made such a long-lasting impact on language, and how it managed to stay alive for two millennia despite the cultural superiority of Greek. He will look at how Latin's sturdy roots remained untouched while empires were raised and fell, the influence of religion, war and the ways it has progressed through medieval times right up until the present day. The Latin language has proved far more far reaching than its creators. Today it continues to define the way our societies have developed technologically and scientifically and the way we practise law and worship our Christian God.	2007-11-05	HarperPress						ZZZ000000

'If you could tell me just one thing about yourself, what would it be?' She begins, 'I would say that I once lost a brother.' As a young man disappears, his family is left wondering, hoping, fearing for what may have become of him. It is only through his loss that they begin to truly understand the deep bond of love that ties their family together. Aneesa, his sister, feels the loss of her brother intensely and, unable to live in the vacuum left by his disappearance, she leaves her home and all she holds dear. She moves to London seeking a new life, new friends, and a release from her sorrow. There she meets an older man, another exile who reminds her of home. Brought together by their shared feeling for their homeland, they form an unlikely friendship. Yet, aneesa finds she cannot mourn without knowing the truth about her brother's death, she cannot get on with her life without some certainty. Meanwhile, back home, Aneesa's mother is grieving for her son. Unable to cope with his loss, she resorts to her community's traditional beliefs and imagines he has been reincarnated. Aneesa reluctantly returns home, determined to uncover the truth behind her brother's disappearance, and rekindle the sense of belonging that she left behind. Dreams of Water is a moving story of love, loss and family. Set against a backdrop of upheaval and violence, it reminds us of the importance of hope, of love, and of the strength of family.	2007	HarperCollins						ZZZ000000

9780007233434	The cleft	Doris May Lessing		Doris Lessing, one of England's finest living novelists, invites us to imagine a mythical society free from sexual intrigue, free from jealousy, free from petty rivalries: a society free from men. An old Roman senator, contemplative at his late stage of life, embarks on what will likely be his last endeavour: the retelling of the story of human creation. He recounts the history of the Clefts, an ancient community of women living in an Edenic, coastal wilderness, confined within the valley of an overshadowing mountain. The Clefts have no need nor knowledge of men - childbirth is controlled, like the tides that lap around their feet, through the cycles of the moon, and their children are always female. But with the unheralded birth of a strange, new child - a boy - the harmony of their community is suddenly thrown into jeopardy. At first, in their ignorance, the Clefts are awestruck by this seemingly malformed child, but as more and more of these threateningly unfamiliar males appear, now unfavourably nicknamed Squirts, they are rejected, and are exposed on the nearby mountainside; sacrificed to the patrolling eagles overhead, the sentinels of their female haven. Unbeknownst to the Clefts, however, these baby males survive, aided by the very eagles sent to kill them, and thrive on their own on the other side of the mountain. It is not until an unusually curious young Cleft named Maire goes beyond the geographical, and emotional, divide of the mountain that this disquieting fact is uncovered - a discovery that forces the Clefts to accept and realign themselves to the prospect of a now shared world, and the possible vengeance of the wronged males. In this fascinating and beguiling novel, Lessing confronts head-on the themes that inspired much of her early writing: how men and women, two similar and yet thoroughly distinct creatures, manage to live side by side in the world, and how the specifics of gender affect every aspect of our existence.	2007	Fourth Estate						ZZZ000000

It's also a portrait of a middle class family weathering the turbulence of the 1970s, and a vivid personal history of the decades in which America has taken an angry turn away from its mid-century ideals. The stories told here draw on elements as varied as the effects of Kafka's fiction on Franzen's protracted quest to lose his virginity, the elaborate pranks that he and his friends orchestrated from the roof of his high school, his self-inflicted travails in selling his mother's house after her death, and the web of connections between his all-consuming marriage, the problem of global warming, and the life lessons to be learned in watching birds. These chapters of a Midwestern youth and a New York adulthood are warmed by the same combination of comic scrutiny and unqualified affection that characterize Franzen's fiction, but here the main character is the author himself. Sparkling, daring, arrestingly honest, Franzen narrates the formation of a unique mind and heart in the crucible of an everyday American family.	2007	Harper Perennial						ZZZ000000

9780007235575	By hook or by crook,a journey in search of English	David Crystal		A delightfully discursive, Bill Bryson-esque and personal journey through the groves and the thickets of the English language, by our foremost scholar of the history and structure of the English language.David Crystal has been described (by the Times Higher Education Supplement) as a sort of 'latter day Dr Johnson', a populist linguist who has promoted the study of the English language in an academic and broadcasting career that has so far spanned 40 years and nearly 100 books.Now he has written an engaging travel book of more general appeal. Inspired by W. G. Sebald's _The Rings of Saturn_ and by Bill Bryson's books, he has combined personal reflections, historical allusions and traveller observations to create a mesmerising (and entertaining) narrative account of his encounters with the English language and its speakers throughout the world _ from Bangor to Bombay and from Stratford to San Francisco._By Hook or by Crook_ is an attempt to capture the exploratory, seductive, teasing, tantalising nature of language study. As such, it will appeal to the ever-growing market who like to be entertained as well as instructed.	2008	Harper Perennial						ZZZ000000

9780007241293	Sexus	Henry Miller		The extraordinarily candid tale of Miller's sexual escapades amongst the low-life of Brooklyn, banned in Great Britain and America for nearly twenty years after its first publication in 1949. 'I was approaching my thirty-third year, the age Christ was crucified. A wholly new life lay before me, had I the courage to risk all.' When Henry Miller left America for Paris in the 1930s to lead the life of a literary bohemian, he called this death of his former existence and his resurrection as a writer a 'rosy crucifixion'. This dramatic transformation provided the leitmotif for some of Miller's finest writing, embodying everything he felt about self-liberation and the true life of the spirit. 'Sexus', the first volume in the 'Rosy Crucifixion' trilogy, looks back in fictionalised form to Miller's America life in the 1920s. Frantically seeking antidotes to his dreary job and life 'in a morbidly respectable neighbourhood' with his wife Maude, Miller becomes obsessed with the promiscuous and mysterious Mara, dance hall hostess, femme fatale and pathological liar. First published in Paris in 1949, this picaresque, extraordinarily candid tale of Miller's sexual escapades amongst the low-life of Brooklyn was banned in Great Britain and America for nearly twenty years.	2006	Harper Perennial						ZZZ000000

9780007241675	Wild Swans,Three Daughters of China	Jung Chang		One of the best-selling and best-loved books of recent years, 'Wild Swans' is an epic true story of how one family lived and survived through some of China's most unsettling and violent times. The publication of 'Wild Swans' in 1991 was a worldwide phenomenon. Not only did it become the best-selling non-fiction book in British publishing history, with sales of well over two million, it was received with unanimous critical acclaim, and was named the winner of the 1992 NCR Book Award and the 1993 British Book of the Year Award. Few books have ever had such an impact on their readers. Through the story of three generations of women - grandmother, mother and daughter - 'Wild Swans' tells nothing less than the whole tumultuous history of China's tragic twentieth century, from sword-bearing warlords to Chairman Mao, from the Manchu Empire to the Cultural Revolution. At times terrifying, at times astonishing, always deeply moving, 'Wild Swans' is a book in a million, a true story with all the passion and grandeur of a great novel. Jung Chang's introduction brings her own story up to date, describing the effect 'Wild Swans'' success has had on her life.	2007-02-05	HarperCollins Publishers Limited						BIO000000
9780007241767	Angela's ashes,a memoir of a childhood	Frank McCourt		The phenomenal worldwide bestseller: Frank McCourt's sad, funny, bittersweet memoir of growing up in New York in the 30s and in Ireland in the 40s. It is a story of extreme hardship and suffering, in Brooklyn tenements and Limerick slums - too many children, too little money, his mother Angela barely coping as his father Malachy's drinking bouts constantly brings the family to the brink of disaster. It is a story of courage and survival against apparently overwhelming odds. Written with the vitality and resonance of a work of fiction, and with a remarkable absence of sentimentality, 'Angela's Ashes' is imbued on every page with Frank McCourt's distinctive humour and compassion. Out of terrible circumstances, he has created a glorious book in the tradition of Ireland's literary masters, which bears all the marks of a great classic.	2007-02-05	Harper Perennial						ZZZ000000
9780007241774	Stuart,A Life Backwards	Alexander Masters		A highly original and captivating memoir which has captured the hearts of readers everywhere. 'Stuart, A Life Backwards', is the story of a remarkable friendship between a reclusive writer and illustrator ('a middle class scum ponce, if you want to be honest about it, Alexander) and a chaotic, knife-wielding beggar whom he gets to know during a campaign to release two charity workers from prison. Interwoven into this is Stuart's confession: the story of his life, told backwards. With humour, compassion (and exasperation) Masters slowly works back through post-office heists, prison riots and the exact day Stuart discovered violence, to unfold the reasons why he changed from a happy-go-lucky little boy into a polydrug-addicted-alcoholic Jekyll and Hyde personality, with a fondness for what he called 'little strips of silver' (knives to you and me). Funny, despairing, brilliantly written and full of surprises: this is the most original and moving biogrpahy of recent years.	2007-03-01	HarperCollins Publishers Limited						ZZZ000000
9780007241804	Bad Blood	Lorna Sage		A literary memoir of the highest calibre by the highly-regarded writer Lorna Sage, which vividly and wittily brings to life a vanished time and place, and illuminates the lives of three generations of women. Lorna Sage's memoir of childhood and adolescence is a brilliantly written bravura piece of work, which vividly and wickedly brings to life her eccentric family and somewhat bizarre upbringing in the small town of Hanmer, on the border between Wales and Shropshire. The period as well as the place is evoked with crystal clarity: from the 1940s, dominated for Lorna by her dissolute but charismatic vicar grandfather, through the 1950s, where the invention of fish fingers revolutionised the lives of housewives like Lorna's mother, to the brink of the 1960s, where the community is shocked by Lorna's pregnancy at 16, an event which her grandmother blamed on 'the fiendish invention of sex'. Often extremely funny,and always intelligent, this unique memoir was instantly hailed as a classic upon its first publication.	2007	Harper Perennial						ZZZ000000

We feel this fear whenever others humiliate or belittle us, or whenever we discover a serious discrepancy between what we thought our life was and what it actually is. The greater our fear, the more desperate our defence against it, the most desperate of defences being what psychiatrists call mental disorders. Yet, by knowing ourselves we can go beyond our fear and face life with courage.	2007	Harper Perennial						ZZZ000000
9780007247202	The Golden Notebook	Doris May Lessing		The striking reissue of this classic Lessing novel. Widely regarded as one of the most influential books of the twentieth century.Anna Wulf is a young novelist with writer's block. Divorced, with a young child, and disillusioned by unsatisfactory relationships, she feels her life is falling apart. In fear of madness, she records her experiences in four coloured notebooks. The black notebook addresses her problems as a writer; the red her political life; the yellow her relationships and emotions; and the blue becomes a diary of everyday events. But it is the fifth notebook - the Golden Notebook - which is the key to her recovery and renaissance.Bold and illuminating, fusing sex, politics, madness and motherhood, 'The Golden Notebook' is at once a wry and perceptive portrait of the intellectual and moral climate of the 1950s - a society on the brink of feminism - and a powerful and revealing account of a woman searching for her own personal and political identity.	2007	Harper Perennial						ZZZ000000

'Nobody's perfect,' says a little girl in a walled garden. Certainly not the child stolen from a shabby London street. Or the sexually frustrated suburban vicar. Or least of all, perhaps, the woman who runs out of good times and comes to perch like a cuckoo in the bosom of a perfect family. Fallen Angel uncovers the secret history of a murderer, tracing the full damage and horror of an unforgiving killer over forty years. A chilling account of one family's self-destruction, the story slowly strips away the past, like an archaeological dig, to reveal the menace lurking in the present - the anatomy of a killer.	2007-04-19	Harper						ZZZ000000

Since the victim is one of their own, the department directs the bulk of its resources toward finding her attacker.

If they do not come up with her before she rounds the Horn, they must follow her into the Great South Sea and as far across the Pacific as she may lead them. It is a commission after Jack's own heart. Maturin has fish of his own to fry in the world of secret intelligence. Aubrey has to cope with a succession of disasters - men overboard, castaways, encounters with savages, storms, typhoons, groundings, shipwrecks, to say nothing of murder and criminal insanity. That the enemy is in fact faithfully dealt with, no one who has the honour of Captain Aubrey's acquaintance can take leave to doubt.	2007-11-05	Harper Perennial						ZZZ000000

9780007257799	3 Para	Patrick Bishop		It is now clear that the British prescence in Afganistan - billed by our Government as 'a mission to provide peace and security' - has witnessed some of the deadliest fighting and most extreme warfare since the Korean War. Patrick Bishop, best-selling author of "Fighter Boys" and the forthcoming "Bomber Boys", has been given exclusive access to the Parachute Regiment known as '3 Para', which during the summer of 2006 suffered some of the worst fighting of the Afganistan conflict. In thie definitive account of what happened to the men and women of the 3 Para in the heat of Helmland, Bishop reveals the hitherto unreported conditions in which they were forced to fight. With soldiers battling not only the enemy, but also the 50 degree heat, insufficient rations, lack of ground forces and nearly fatal amounts of sleep deprivation, this desperate conflict has come to embody a war more reminiscent of Rourke's Drift - characterised by fierce hand-to-hand fighting against an ever increasing Taliban threat - then the antiseptic warfare promised by modern technology. Recognition of 3 Para's achievement was made by the award of a Victoria Cross and a George Cross to two soldiers in A Company - the highest achieveable awards for gallantry. This is a war that has been fought far from the media and the public gaze. Now, for the first time, we have access to the true stories that have remained hidden behind the headlines. Patrick Bishop's vital and unique account of modern warfare in extraordinary times and these innumerable stories of breathtaking bravery will make modern military history.	2007-09-03	HarperCollins Publishers Limited						ZZZ000000

9780007261277	Machiavelli	Ross King		'The Prince', Niccole Machiavelli's handbook on power-how to get it and how to keep it-has been enormously influential in the centuries since it was written, garnering a heady mixture of admiration, fear, and contempt. Its author, born to an established middle-class family, was no prince himself. Machiavelli worked as a courtier and diplomat for the Republic of Florence, and enjoyed some small fame in his time as the author of bawdy plays and poems. Upon the Medici's return to power, however, he found himself summarily dismissed from the government he had served for decades and exiled from the city where he was born. In this discerning new biography, Ross King rescues Machiavelli's legacy from caricature, detailing the vibrant political and social context that influenced his thought and underscoring the humanity of one of history's finest political thinkers. Ross King's Machiavelli visits fortune-tellers, produces wine on his Tuscan estate, travels Europe tirelessly on horseback as a diplomatic envoy, and is a passionate scholar of antiquity-but above all, a keen observer of human nature.	2007	HarperCollins Publishers Limited						ZZZ000000

At a time when he is coming up to the fantastic achievement of 100 million copies sold worldwide across all his books, his fans will be delighted with the first ever official biography of Paulo, an in-depth look at his life and work, and what makes him the much-loved author he is today.Paulo's first official biographer, Fernando Morais, provides an exhaustive look at Paulo's fascinating and varied life, taking several years to research his subject, and interviewing everyone who knows Paulo. He weaves together the strands of Paulo's life, revealing the man behind the world-famous writer. Paulo Coelho was born in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in August 1947. Before he became internationally known and a worldwide bestseller, he had to overcome many obstacles. As a teenager, he was subjected to the brutality of electric shock treatment in the psychiatric hospital where his parents, who took his rebelliousness as a sign of madness, interned him three times. As a member of the esoteric underworld, he was put in prison for alleged subversive activities against the Brazilian dictatorship and subjected to physical torture.Later, Paulo joined forces with rock star Raul Seixas and together they composed songs that revolutionized Brazilian rock music. Hippie, journalist, rock star, actor, playwright, theatre director and producer of television programs, this whirlwind life came to an end in 1982, during a trip to Europe. In Dachau and later in Amsterdam, Paulo had a mystical meeting with "J", his new mentor, who persuaded him to walk the Road to Santiago de Compostela, a medieval pilgrim's route between France and Spain.In 1986 Paulo walked the Road to Santiago, and it was there that he reconverted to Christianity and found again the faith bequeathed to him by the Jesuit fathers of his school years. He would later describe this experience in his first book, The Pilgrimage. The following year, The Alchemist, established his worldwide reputation. The novel has already achieved the status of a universally admired modern classic. Now, for the first time, discover the true story of the man behind some of the world's most loved books.

Does free will exist? Based on exciting discoveries in mathematics, genetics, psychology and sociology, 'Connected' is an innovative and fascinating exploration of how social networks operate. Think it's all about who you know? It is. But not the way you think. Turns out your colleague's husband's sister can make you fat, even if you don't know her. And a happy friend is more relevant to your happiness than a bigger income. Our connections - our friends, their friends, and even their friends' friends - have an astonishing power to influence everything from what we eat to who we sleep with. And we, in turn, influence others. Our actions can change the behaviours, the beliefs, and even the basic health of people we've never met. In this brilliantly original and effortlessly engaging exploration of how much we truly influence one another, pre-eminent social scientists Nicholas Christakis and James Fowler explain why obesity is contagious, why the rich get richer, even how we find and choose our partners. Intriguing and entertaining, with revelatory implications for everything from our notion of the individual to ideas about public health initiatives, "Connected" will change the way you think about every aspect of your life, and how you live it.

9780261103559	Finn and Hengest,The Fragment and the Episode	John Ronald Reuel Tolkien&Alan Bliss		Tolkien's famous translations and lectures on the story of two fifth-century heroes in northern Europe.Professor J.R.R.Tolkien is most widely known as the author of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, but he was also a distinguished scholar in the field of Mediaeval English language and literature. His most significant contribution to Anglo-Saxon studies is to be found in his lectures on Finn and Hengest (pronounced Hen-jist), two fifth-century heroes in northern Europe.The story is told in two Old English poems, Beowulf and The Fights at Finnesburg, but told so obscurely and allusively that its interpretation had been a matter of controversy for over 100 years. Bringing his unique combination of philological erudition and poetic imagination to the task, however, Tolkien revealed a classic tragedy of divided loyalties, of vengeance, blood and death.Tolkien's original and persuasive solution of the many problems raised by the story ranged widely through the early history and legend of the Germanic peoples. The story has the added attraction that it describes the events immediately preceding the first Germanic invasion of Britain which was led by Hengest himself.This book will be of interest not only to students of Old English and all those interested in the history of northern Europe and Anglo-Saxon England, but also admirers of The Lord of the Rings who will be fascinated to see how Tolkien handled a story which he did not invent.	1998-03-19	HarperCollins						ZZZ000000

After reading 'The Great War for Civilisation' the reader grasps just why those 19 suicide pilots changed the world on September 11th. Assessing the situation right up to the present day and reporting from the heart of a bombed-out Baghdad, Fisk examines the factors leading up to the coalition forces entering Iraq, and discusses possible outcomes of long-term involvement there.	2006	Harper Perennial						ZZZ000000

9788172235635	Eleven Minutes	Paulo Coelho		Paulo Coelho's astonishingly beautiful writing in Eleven Minutes virtually guarantees it the cult status that The Alchemist already enjoys. But what is the Paulo Coelho phenomenon? How can an author who (only a short time ago) was virtually unknown to most readers have taken the world of books by storm--and without the benefit of glitzy advertising? The answer is simple: quality. Such books as The Fifth Mountain andThe Devil and Miss Prym are enough to explain a considerable following for the author, with their atmospheric prose and involving characters. Eleven Minutes tells the story of young Maria living an innocent life in a Brazilian village and is played out in a measured fashion, but with all the author's brilliant scene-setting (very lush here) fully in place. But then Maria experiences love and suffers great pain. From this point, Coelho has us inexorably in his grip. Maria's disillusionment with love leads her to Geneva where she finally ends up selling her body (Coelho may offer us the beauty of life, but never at the expense of its harshness). Maria's approach to sex is complex--this is no mere revulsion arising from what she is now doing with her life. And then she meets a seductive young painter, who may or may not offer her a new path in life. But does she prefer to continue on the dark sexual odyssey she has embarked on, at the expense of real love? There are echoes of DH Lawrence in Coelho's exploration of the sacred and spiritual aspects of sex and it's a brave author who tackles a subject that can so easily slip into strained seriousness. That never happens here, and Maria's journey is one that the reader willingly undertakes; the lesson she learns are lessons for the reader. --Barry Forshaw	2006-03-01	HarperCollins Publishers India						ZZZ000000

9788172237110	The Ramayana	Ramesh Menon		The Ramayana Is Certainly One Of The World'S Oldest Legends. Modern Scholars Claim That It Was First Composed Around 300 Bc. The Devout Hindu Believes That Rama Lived Many Hundred Millennia Ago, In The Treta Yuga, And That Was Also When Valmiki First Told His Immortal Story. The Epic Is Called The Adi Kavya, The World'S First Poem. The God Brahma Himself Is Meant To Have Inspired Valmiki To Create His Classic, In Twenty-Four Thousand Slokas. The Sages Of India Have Always Said That The True Purpose Of The Ramayana Is To Awaken Its Reader Spiritually, And To Send Him Forth On The Great Journey That Leads To Moksha, To God. Though He Takes No Liberties With The Story, Ramesh Menon'S Ramayana Is A Novelist'S Lush, Imaginative Rendering Of The Epic, Rather Than A Scholar'S Translation . Yet, Even If The Language He Uses Is Modern And Exciting, His Book Remains, First And Last, A Work Of Worship, Of Bhakti. As He Wrote And Rewrote It For Ten Years, This Was His Offering To Rama.	2008-03-01	HarperCollins						ZZZ000000

9780007222032	Specimen Days	Michael Cunningham		This is one of the most anticipated novels of this or any other year, from the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of The Hours.Specimen Days is three linked visionary narratives about the relationship between man and machine. The first narrative, a ghost story set at the height of the Industrial Revolution, tells the story of man-eating machines. An ecstatic boy, barely embodied in the physical world, speaks in the voice of the great visionary poet Walt Whitman. He works at an oppressive factory connected to the making of a mysterious substance with some universal function and on which the world's economy somehow depends. The slight boy can barely operate the massive machine which speaks to him in the voice of his devoured brother. A woman who was to have married the brother is now the object of obsessive interest by the boy. In a city in which all are mastered by the machine, the boy is convinced that the woman must be saved before she too is devoured.This grisly but ultimately transformative story establishes three main characters who will appear, re-incarnated, in the other two sections of this startling modern novel. The boy, the man and the woman are each in search of some sort of transcendence as is made manifest by the recurrence of the words of Whitman ('It avails not, neither distance nor place...I am with you, and know how it is'). In part two, a noir thriller set in the early years of our current century, the city is at threat from maniacal bombers, while the third and last part plays with the sci-fi genre, taking our characters centuries into the future. The man who was devoured by a machine in part one is now literally a machine - a robot who becomes fully human before our eyes. The woman is a refugee from another part of the universe, a warrior in her native land but a servant on this planet. The boy leaves the earth at the novel's close in search of a new-found land.Specimen Days is a genre bending, haunting ode to life itself - a work of surpassing power and beauty by one of the most original and daring writers at work today.	2006	Harper Perennial						ZZZ000000

Until, that is, the popular Thomas Seymour - bold, handsome, witty and irresistible - began a relentless courtship that won her heart. Kate fell passionately in love for the first time in her life and, also for the first time, threw caution to the wind with a marriage that shocked the worldly courtiers around her.But all too soon it becomes obvious that Thomas has plans beyond his marriage for the young, capricious, quick-witted heir to the throne - Elizabeth - and that in his quest for power, he might even be prepared to betray his now pregnant wife...Kate's whirlwind romance is witnessed and recounted by her closest friend, Catherine, Duchess of Suffolk, who lives through the tumultuous years after Henry's death at Kate's side. A sharp and canny courtier in her own right, Cathy is keenly aware of the political realities of life at court and is, apparently, a loyal supporter of her friend. As her story weaves its way through that of Kate and Thomas's heady passion and tragic denouement, however, it gradually becomes clear that Cathy has her own tale of betrayal and regret to tell...	2007-07-30	Harper Perennial						FIC014000

9780091795252	An Indian Odyssey	Martin Buckley		Martin Buckley travels from north-east India to Sri Lanka to recreate one of the great journeys in world literature -- the Ramayana. Myth, travelogue and holy writ, the Ramayana -- the journey of Rama -- is India's best-loved book, an inspiration to schoolchildren, monks and movie-makers. It's one of the world's great epic tales, yet it is largely unread in the Western world. The story of a man searching savage jungles for his kidnapped wife, the Ramayana combines Heart of Darkness with the Odyssey. And, bizarrely, this violent and erotic account of a war between light and dark is at the heart of the fiercest controversy in contemporary Indian politics -- one that has claimed over 10,000 lives. In his book, Martin Buckley fulfils a dream -- to retrace the route of Rama from his birthplace in north India to the climax of his confrontation with Evil in Sri Lanka. In doing so, he finds that the epic is as much a key to understanding India today as it was 3,000 years ago. An Indian Odyssey is the story of a perilous passage through India by motorbike, microlight, bus and train. In the course of his physical and spiritual odyssey, Buckley witnesses death on the chaotic Great Trunk Road and passes through a war zone in Sri Lanka. A cast of mystics, Marxists, idealists and cynics -- Hindu, Muslim and Buddhist -- lays out the rich fabric of contemporary India and Sri Lanka, illuminated by the remarkable story of their past.	2008	Hutchinson						ZZZ000000

In How to Have Creative Ideas, Edward de Bono (the inventor of lateral and parallel thinking) has created 62 different games and exercises built around random words, to help encourage creativity and lateral thinking. For example, if the task were to come up with an idea for a new restaurant, and the random word chosen was "cloak," ideas generated might be: a highwayman theme; a Venetian theme with gondolas; masked waiters. Or, if asked to make a connection between the two random words "desk" and "shorts," readers might come up with: both are functional; desks have knee spaces and shorts expose the knees. All the exercises are simple, practical and fun, and can be performed by anyone.	2008-01-08	Random House UK						ZZZ000000

A pesar de los anos transcurridos, los presupuestos y fundamentos historicos que analiza, sobre los que se ha asentado la moral sexual occidental, resultan aun vigentes en su mayoria, y solo en algunos casos en los que el autor acude a ejemplos concretos podrian considerarse superados. En la caracterizacion de cualquier sociedad, antigua o moderna, existen dos elementos de primera importancia: el sistema economico y el sistema familiar. Para Russell no existe una supremacia de uno sobre otro y es indudable que el sistema economico tiene una gran influencia sobre la moral sexual.	1985-08-26	Routledge						ZZZ000000

Goldratt&Jeff Cox&David Whitford		Written in a fast-paced thriller style, The Goal, a gripping novel, is transforming management thinking throughout the world. It is a book to recommend to your friends in industry - even to your bosses - but not to your competitors. Alex Rogo is a harried plant manager working ever more desperately to try improve performance. His factory is rapidly heading for disaster. So is his marriage. He has ninety days to save his plant - or it will be closed by corporate HQ, with hundreds of job losses. It takes a chance meeting with a professor from student days - Jonah - to help him break out of conventional ways of thinking to see what needs to be done. The story of Alex's fight to save his plant is more than compulsive reading. It contains a serious message for all managers in industry and explains the ideas, which underline the Theory of Constraints (TOC), developed by Eli Goldratt.	2005	Productivity and quality publishing private limited						ZZZ000000
9788185986005	Swami And Friends	Rasipuram K. Narayan		Swami is ten years old, and life for him consists mainly of having adventures with his friends, avoiding the misery of homework, and coping as best as he can with the teachers and other adults he encounters. His greatest passion is the M CC - the Malgudi Cricket Club - which he founds together with his friends: his greatest day is when the examinations are over and school breaks up - a time for revelry and cheerful ritousness. But the innocent and impulsive Swami lands in trouble when he is carried away by the more serious unrest of India in 1930. Somehow he gets himself expelled from two schools in succession, and when things have gone quite out of hand he is forced to run away from home ... This is far more than a simple narrative of Swami's adventures - charming and entertaining as they are. By the delicate sympathetically observed, the author establishes for us the child's world as the child himself sees it: and beyond, the adult community he will one day belong to - in Swami's case, the town of Malgudi, which provides the setting of almost all Narayan's later novels.	2007-04-01	Indian Thought Publications						ZZZ000000

Rising on merit to captain his own vessel, Laurence has earned himself a beautiful fiancče, society's esteem and a golden future. But the war is not going well. It seems Britain can only wait as Napoleon plans to overrun her shores.After a skirmish with a French ship, Laurence finds himself in charge of a rare cargo: a dragon egg bound for the Emperor himself. Dragons are much prized: properly trained, they can mount a fearsome attack from the skies. One of Laurence's men must take the beast in hand and join the aviators' cause, thus relinquishing all hope of a normal life.But when the newly-hatched dragon ignores the young midshipman Laurence chose as its keeper and decides to imprint itself on the horrified captain instead, Laurence's world falls apart. Gone is his golden future: gone his social standing, and soon his beautiful fiancče, as he is consigned to be the constant companion and trainer of the fighting dragon Temeraire...	2007-08-06	Harper Collins Paperbacks						ZZZ000000

Until, that is, they go one step too far ā and the results begin to tear an entire community apart.Skunk Cunningham is an eleven-year-old girl in a coma. She has a loving dad, an absent mother and a brother who plays more X-Box than is good for him. She also has the neighbours from hell: the five Oswald girls and their thuggish father Bob, vicious bullies all of them, whose reign of terror extends unchallenged over their otherwise quiet suburban street.And yet terrifying though they undoubtedly are, the stiletto-wearing, cider-swilling Oswald girls are also sexy ā so when Saskia asks shy, virginal Rick Buckley for a ride in his new car, he canāt believe his luck. Too bad that Saskia canāt keep her big mouth shut. When, after a quick fumble, she broadcasts Rickās deficiencies to anyone who will listen, it puts ideas into her younger sisterās silly head ā ideas that will see Rick dragged off to prison, humiliated, and ultimately, in his fatherās words, ābrokenā by the experience.From her hospital bed, Skunk tries to make sense of the events that follow, as Saskiaās small act of cruelty spreads through the neighbourhood in a web of increasing violence. As we inch closer to the mystery behind her coma, Skunkās innocence becomes a beacon by which we navigate a world as comic as it is tragic, and as effortlessly engaging as it is ultimately uplifting, in this brilliant and utterly original debut novel.	2009-04-02	HarperCollins Publishers Limited						ZZZ000000

Ten years after the cataclysmic events of Wrath of a Mad God took place, Midkemia now faces a new danger thought buried in myth and antiquity.A lost race of elves, the taredhel or 'people of the stars', have found a way across the universe to reach Midkemia. On their current home world, these elves are hard pressed by a ravaging demon horde, and what was once a huge empire has been reduced to a handful of survivors. The cornerstone of taredhel lore is the tale of their lost origins in the world they call simply 'Home', a place lost in the mists of time. Now they are convinced that Midkemia is that place, and they are coming to reclaim it. Ruthless and arrogant, the taredhel intend to let nothing stand in their way; but before long, Pug and the Conclave realise that it's not necessarily the elves, but the demon horde pursuing them where the true danger lies. And hanging over Pug always is the prophecy that he will be doomed to watch everyone he loves die before him'Ś	2010	HarperCollins Publishers Limited						FIC009000
9780007353552	Wolf Hall	Mantel Hilary		England, the 1520s. Henry VIII is on the throne, but has no heir. Cardinal Wolsey is his chief advisor, charged with securing the divorce the pope refuses to grant. Into this atmosphere of distrust and need comes Thomas Cromwell, first as Wolsey´s clerk, and later his Cromwell is a wholly original man: the son of a brutal blacksmith, a political genius, a briber, a charmer, a bully, a man with a delicate and deadly expertise in manipulating people and events. Ruthless in pursuit of his own interests, he is as ambitious in his wider politics as he is for himself. His reforming agenda is carried out in the grip of a selfinterested parliament and a king who fluctuates between romantic passions and murderous rages.From one of our finest living writers, Wolf Hall is that very rare thing: a truly great English novel, one that explores the intersection of individual psychology and wider politics. With a vast array of characters, and richly overflowing with incident, it peels back history to show us Tudor England as a half-made society, moulding itself us Tudor England as a half-made society, moulding itself	2009-01-01	Harper Collins India						ZZZ000000

Soon after abandoning his native New York in the 1960s to pursue his career in the UK, Visconti found himself in the thick of the emerging glam rock movement. His first commercial success came with T.Rex, but it was with the then-unknown David Bowie that Visconti made his mark on the music scene. He has since worked with dozens of famous artists, among them Thin Lizzy, Morrissey, Iggy Pop, U2, and Wings. In this riveting autobiography, Visconti recalls the stories from his early days up until his present life back in New York. Filled with the groups and artists who shaped and made the pop scene, this is the story of a life spent behind the music."Visconti’s story should be read by anyone who aspires to work as a producer in the music industry."  —Library Journal"Without question, Visconti is one of the greatest and most innovative music producers of all time. His gritty history of two decades of British pop makes me want to brush the dust off my old Bowie and T.Rex albums and skip-jive around the kitchen." —Daily Mail"Visconti's rare knack for musical arrangement, and directing and engineering recordings, underpins some of the finest work of the pre and post-rock glam era."  —The Mail on Sunday"Just as George Martin was the definitive '60s producer, so Tony Visconti's work with David Bowie and Marc Bolan shaped rock's landscape in the '70s." —Q"What makes this latest installment of the baby-boomer's tale so readable is his easy-going, unjudgmental familiarity with the professional foibles of his clients. Not many people can remark, as he does of Bob Geldof, that 'singing is not his forte,' without the slightest trace of bitchiness or reproach." —The Sunday Times Culturemagazine"Visconti's sparky autobiography takes you stomping back to the frantic, glory days of glam rock and pop."  —London LiteTony Visconti continues to work with Morrissey and numerous other artists.	2007	HarperCollins						ZZZ000000

Andersen and his Danish 'fairy tales'. All three are united not only by Khair's chosen language of creativity, English, but also by a concern with reflecting about life and loss, identity and indoctrination, humanity and divinity, and the nature of things and being.  Drawing subtly upon the past, Khair engages powerfully and movingly with many issues and events, particular and perennial, of vital concern to the reader today: immigration, Afghanistan, terror, love, loss, death, human duplicity, faith, prejudice, the Iraq War, genocideâ€¦	2010	HarperCollins						ZZZ000000

It sets forth, as far as possible without mathematical and logical symbolism, the grounds in favour of the view that mathematics and logic are identical. It proposes simply that what is commonly called mathematics are merely later deductions from logical premises. It provided the thesis for which Principia Mathematica provided the detailed proof, and introduced the work of Frege to a wider audience.In addition to the new introduction by John Slater, this edition contains Russell's introduction to the 1937 edition in which he defends his position against his formalist and intuitionist critics.	1992	Routledge						ZZZ000000

9788188452132	The Art Of Living : Vipassana Meditation	Goenka		Vipassana is one of India's most techniques of meditation. 2500 Years ago it was re-discovered by the Gotama the Buddha and taught by him as a universal remedy for universal ills. At first, the technique flourished in India but gradually it became corrupted, lost its efficacy, and disappeared from the land of its origin. Fortunately, the neighbouring country of Burma preserved the original form of vipassana through the millennia. Since 1969, it has been re- introduced into India, where it is now striking deep roots. Vipassana is a Pali word meaning insight, seeing things as they really are. It is not a blind faith or philosophy, and has nothing to do with sectarian religion. Instead, Vipassana is a practical method that can be applied by anyone of average intelligence. Its goal is to purify the mind to eliminate the tensions and negativities that make us miserable Vipassana meditation is taught by Shri Satya Narayan Goenka and his assistant teachers. Courses are held regularly in different parts of India and abroad. The Art of Living is the first book to appear in English that accurately describes at length, for the general reader, Vipassana meditation as taught by Shri S.N.Goenka.	1987	Embassy Book Distributors						ZZZ000000
