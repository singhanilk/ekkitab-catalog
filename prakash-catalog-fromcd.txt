When these are traced on the highest and the most massive mountains on the planet, this chronicle of light turns into an aesthetic experience. Ashok Dilwaii starts by recording the footprints of the dark, captures the circling of the constellations in his nocturnal photography, moves on to the pre-twilight hours of rose-shadow, mauve-shadow to the moment when just the jagged line of mountain peaks emerge, while the body of the mountain is still coated with night. Then comes the moment, when in Khayyam's words, the Sultan's turret is struck by a shaft of light.'Dawn to dark' has been set through a play of light, made rich with poetic expressions of mountains and peppered by the photographer's spine-chilling experiences in his own words. This is not just another book on the pretty Himalayas; this is a statement of a photographer's work on one serious subject involving a whole lifetime!	2007	Prakash Books	180	English			1	ZZZ000000

While Sikhism developed and flourished recently, itsnuances have not been fully absorbed in all sections of society.

She alsobrings light to bear on the importance, within the Sikh cultural and religiousheritage, of shabads or hymns and the Adi Granth, the book of learning thatdefines the Sikh way of living in the absence of idols or images of God. Alongwith this she also brings reference to the Gurbani, the Gurmat (or thought), theGuru ka Langar through which the devout and the hungry are fed in a service akinto serving God, as also the community's architectural heritage, best representedthrough the Golden Temple in Amritsar.

It is a great occasion for festivities. Among the Hindus, it is a widespread belief that marriage links man and woman physically, socially, and morally.

Banks and other financial institutions are more prone to attacks by this virus in spite of the presence of foolproof systems. But systems do not execute themselves. It is therefore equally important to learn how and why things go wrong. Many individuals fall prey to the temptation of easy money. And to make matters worse they feel they can outsmart others and cover their misdeeds. This book is a compilation of short-stories on how a particular fraud or forgery was planned, attempted and was successful. All the individuals involved were, however, later caught and punished according to the crime committed. This aspect, however, has been deliberately legt hanging, so that the actual happening does not get diluted. The emphasis is thus on the modus operandi only and the actual situation as happened has been laid out bare for the reader to look at.	2006	Prakash Books	196	English			1	ZZZ000000

It is the sanctuary of the main Asian religions, Hinduism, Buddhism, and Shamanism, where most traditions have been left untouched by foreign influences. In fact, the Kathmandu Valley keeps itself alive with the antique traditions of the virginity cult. The living Goddess or the Kumari Devi is the most important character for any traditional Nepalese. She is the Goddess protecting the country and it is only after her benediction that the King of Nepal had the permission to lead the country's affairs for the following year. Nepal is also a sanctuary of nature and races. Its climate, flora and fauna are extremely rich and shelter a number of ethnic groups. These little groups live precariously within harsh natural elements, through heat and cold, subtropical rains and high altitude deserts, and have astonishing communal organisations, which could be considered as a model in our modern society. The arts of Nepal are splendid and in plenty. The country is known of course for its architectural treasures mainly present in the Katmandu valley. The wooden sculptures of their struts are unique in the world as are the excellent golden bronzes admired in the public places and the numerous temples of Buddhist and Hindu religions. The Buddhist Thangka paintings are world famous and the murals of the monasteries and temples evoke envy. Nepal is home to mysterious festivals and many rituals are still practiced with as much faith and belief as they were centuries ago. Festivals to call the rain through Macchendranath, to celebrate the memory of the dead, to thank the God of rains after the season and celebrate the protective Goddess of the nation and later the call of the Goddess of Wealth Laxmi to shower riches on the family. It is endless, there is more than a festival a day. Only the people of each of the different communities are aware of their own fetes. Nepal is a place of rich and multiple activities, full of diversities, a refuge of races and the cultures they elaborate. Contents : 1. Looking Back / 2. Exploring the Land of the Gods / 3.

If its forts and palaces and tales of valour are a common thread running through its stirring history, Rajasthan's contradictions too lie in its people, in the way in which festivals are celebrated, the manner in which they dress, drape themselves in colours, ornament their bodies and their homes. And yet, these differences too are part of the pattern into which society in Rajasthan has come to be represented, symbolically as well as practically. Within its folds, there is a rich culture of religions and gods, heroes and deities; of arts and crafts so varied and so exquisite, it is difficult to believe they are the creation of a people that have been nurtured out of necessity.	1999	Prakash Books	188	English			1	ZZZ000000

If its monks and monasteries and tales of masked dances are a common thread running through its stirring history, Sikkim's synchronization also lie in its peace loving Lepchas, Bhutias and Nepalese, the way in which festivals are celebrated amid snow clad peaks, the manner in which they drape themselves in colours and ornament their bodies and their homes. From an independent kingdom to a robust state of India, the world of the Sikkimese under the benign shadow of Mt Khangchendzonga, the third highest mountain in the world and and revered by them as the guardian deity is still a Shangri-La where Hindu and Buddhist shrimes dot the sacred groves.	2008	Prakash Books	168	English			1	ZZZ000000

Though they have come a long way since their moments of glory and pathos, yet many misconceptions about the place continue to exist. And, therein lies the germ of the book which is an attempt to capture the true essence of these islands and portray them with the great felicity they deserve. The text is accompanied by images that interpret and unravel each story and help one navigate through the book which is a product of years of research, exploration and compilation of facts. The book's size, as well as time frame, is colossal. But, the islands are so multi-faceted that to fully-comprehend their verve one has to view them in their entirety. The book, which is absorbing, continually captivating and perhaps the next best thing to a visit, also helps one better understand the six tribal communities of the islands - their origins and ancestry, geographic distribution, socio-economic activities, legends, beliefs and folktales. Likewise, the island's tragic history, reflected in its impressive monuments, make you pause and ponder at the pointless destruction of life and liberty whereas the beauty and bounty of its open spaces add to the sensory abundance of being part of the quintessence of nature.	2006	Prakash Books	228	English			1	ZZZ000000

Massive and looming against a monsoon sky and delicately fragile on a misty winter morning, bright and brittle on a bright sunny afternoon and dreamlike by moonlight, the Taj takes on a new aspect with every passing moment. Responsive to faint shifts of light, to the play of clouds and the drama of sunrise and sunset, the Taj Mahal continues to entrance visitors regardless of how often they go to see this monument, built by a Mughal monarch for his beloved wife. Rupinder Khullar has been photographing the Taj for several years. He shares his knowledge of its architecture and the arts that went into its embellishment with us in this splendid celebration of one of the world's greatest buildings.	2006	Prakash Books	240	English			1	ZZZ000000

Delhi contains some excellent specimens of Indo-Islamic architecture: the Qutb Minar -an admirably sculptured gateway, the Tughlaqabad fort - a magnificent citadel built in rugged surroundings; the Red Fort - an example of grand palace architecture; the Jama Masjid - a simple but majestic royal mosque, Delhi has been the coveted capital of many empires. Battles over possession of the city have left it a mere skeleton of its former splendour but enough remains to bear testimony to its rich and glorious past. If there is any place in India which presents a panorama of 3000 years of continuous habitation and centuries of architectural activity, it is Delhi.	2006	Prakash Books	96	Spanish			1	ZZZ000000

Mahoba and the fort of Kalinjar were its power centres, but it was in Khajuraho that the greatly chronicled Chandella dynasty chose to build its temples. Today, many of the reasons for choosing Khajuraho as a site for the kingdom's great temple building remain obscure. A small village in the Chattarpur district of Madhya Pradesh, Khajuraho is all but surrounded by wilderness in the midst of a hilly forested belt. When the Chandellas declined in power, Khajuraho for all practical purposes, was lost to the world, its magnificent temples succumbing to centuries of abandonment.

In 1801 Ranjit Singh was proclaimed the first Sikh Maharaja of the Panjab, the 'land of the five rivers', at Lahore. The magnificent illustrations include jewellery and gemstones from his treasury and the paintings, luxurious textiles, gold-decorated weapons and armour of his reign. The book also tells the little-known story of the continuing tradition of the later Sikh kingdoms after the Annexation of the Panjab by the British in 1849, as well as the beguiling friendship between the deposed Maharaja Dalip Singh and Queen Victoria. The Arts of the Sikh Kingdoms is published to coincide with the 300th anniversary of a pivotal event in Sikh history, when Guru Gobind Singh (the last of the ten Sikh Gurus) initiated five of his followers to create the Khalsa, or 'Order of the Pure'. Following this, men adopted the name Singh (lion) and the women Kaur (princess), a tradition which, along with customs such as the wearing of turbans, remains to this day.	1999	Prakash Books	256	English			1	ZZZ000000

It is, the polar opposite of 'Malgudi Days' in that all characters are real and the situations, factual. However, the recollection of childhood days through the prism of nearly half-a-century of subsequent existence must necessarily be somewhat refracted. The mind, according to Tagore, is a painter not a camera. It records facts idiosyncratically adding colour according to its own whim and fancy, when and where it pleases. Akira Kurosawa endorses this viewpoint by exploiting this facet of the human mind brilliantly in his film Rashomon. These stories are therefore, ahistoric, purely personalmemoirs.	2007	Prakash Books	n 106	English			1	ZZZ000000

Phrases such as 'living like a Maharaja' or the 'movie Mogul' transport one to India's glorious past. This is not just a conjecture; it is a picture strewn across Indian mythological tales, where lavishness of divine palaces was synonymous with happiness and was described in detail. 'The wonder that was India' has become part of the folklore that we spin out for the young. And it isn't just palaces that have been described in great detail but the fabled jewels of the Rajas and Maharajas as well, who ruled right up to the twentieth century. It was the only source of diamonds before they were discovered in South Africa. The Nizam of Hyderabad, for example, had a 184.5-carat Jacob Diamond as paper-weight on his study table!. India also has a rich legacy of architecture, sculpture and paintings that dates back to thousands of years. The Buddhist Stupa at Sanchi dates back to the second century BC and is the earliest evidence of Indian architectural skills. It would be unfair to make just a brief mention of the heritage art that includes sites like the Ajanta and Ellora Caves, the temples of Khajuraho, the marvellous work of Mughal Architecture - inclusive of the very famous 'Taj Mahal' - (where the marble of the tomb is inlaid with semi-precious stones) and many more. The tapestry of India's cultural heritage is so rich that there are more than twenty-two monuments that have been marked as World Heritage Monuments by UNESCO.  It is against this background that this, "India in Luxury" has been compiled. This luxuriously illustrated volume showcases the finest accommodation available in India, and also offers you glimpses of the cities where these resorts are located. Time-honored building techniques and the traditional decor that was becoming extinct, was revived to create these oases of luxury. Contents : 1. Jaipur; 2. Udaipur; 3. Agra; 4. Ranthambhore; 5.

In an ambitious attempt, the book looks at these species from the point of view of distribution of forests, trees and shrubs, the ancient structure of the crust of the desert, and the food chain that has led to the proliferation and, in some cases, the extinction or near-extinction of some species of wildlife. The book is illustrated with colour plates, photographs taken by naturalists and conservators who have spent several occasions in the wilderness recording these events. This superb book is not only a tribute to the natural wealth of Rajasthan but will also go a long way in helping those people for whom the countryside holds so much enchantment.	1998	Prakash Books	188	English			1	ZZZ000000

BOWRON	PaperBack	Conventional wisdom has it that humiliation is a bad thing (at least for the person it's happening to - let's face it, for everyone watching, it's fantastic entertainment). There is, however, a school of thought which holds that humiliation can actually be a good thing (in a twisted, masochistic, certifiable sort of way). It's not a very large school, and probably not one that you'd fight to have your children attend, but it's there, The theory goes that humiliation. Total Humiliation, is the only state from which True Enlightenment can be achieved. A proponent of this dictum, author Fiona Bowron, shows us how we have been approaching the Enlightenment problem from entirely the wrong angle. We have followed the lifestyle gurus in pursuit of the impossible goal of achieving an ordered and organised life.	2004	NEW HOLLAND PUBLISHE	96	English			1	ZZZ000000
