9788184082388	Understanding Information Systems	Lee Ratzan		In a world awash in data, information systems help provide structure and access to information. Since libraries build, manage, and maintain information systems, librarians and LIS students are often propelled onto the front lines of interactions between library users and technology. But what do librarians need to know to best meet their patron's needs? What exactly are information systems and how do they work? Information expert Ratzan uses plain language, humor, and everyday examples like baseball and arithmetic to make sense of information systems (computer hardware, software, databases, the Internet). He also explores their characteristics, uses, abuses, advantages, and shortcomings for your library. Fun exercises and appendixes are provided to illustrate key points in the book and measure understanding. You can be a technophobe and still learn about systems and subsystems to represent, organize, retrieve, network, secure, conceal, measure, and manage information.This basic introduction addresses both theoretical and practical issues, including: What questions to ask technology vendors to meet your library's needs; When technology may not be the solution to a problem; Secrets for managing an information system; How to make your information system a success; LIS instructors and students, IT staff, digital librarians, library generalists and managers will welcome this expert sourcebook, complete with exercises, references, examples, terms, and charts that clarify concepts.	2008-01-01	Indiana Publishing House						ZZZ000000

Tremendous insight has been gained on a number of key issues. This volume surveys these results. Some of the contributions in this work have appeared elsewhere, while others were written specifically for this collection. The areas covered are organized into 4 sections, and each presents papers by both physicists and mathematicians. This volume collects the most important developments that have taken place in mathematical physics since 1991. It is an essential reference tool for both mathematics and physics libraries and for students of physics and mathematics.

9780821835500	Logic's lost genius,the life of Gerhard Gentzen	Eckart Menzler-Trott		Gerhard Gentzen (1909-1945) is the founder of modern structural proof theory. His lasting methods, rules, and structures resulted not only in the technical mathematical discipline called ''proof theory'' but also in verification programs that are essential in computer science. The appearance, clarity, and elegance of Gentzen's work on natural deduction, the sequent calculus, and ordinal proof theory continue to be impressive even today. The present book gives the first comprehensive, detailed, accurate scientific biography expounding the life and work of Gerhard Gentzen, one of our greatest logicians, until his arrest and death in Prague in 1945. Particular emphasis in the book is put on the conditions of scientific research, in this case mathematical logic, in National Socialist Germany, the ideological fight for ''German logic'', and their mutual protagonists. Numerous hitherto unpublished sources, family documents, archival material, interviews, and letters, as well as Gentzen's lectures for the mathematical public, make this book an indispensable source of information on this important mathematician, his work, and his time. The volume is completed by two deep substantial essays by Jan von Plato and Craig Smorynski on Gentzen's proof theory; its relation to the ideas of Hilbert, Brouwer, Weyl, and Godel; and its development up to the present day. Smorynski explains the Hilbert program in more than the usual slogan form and shows why consistency is important. Von Plato shows in detail the benefits of Gentzen's program. This important book is a self-contained starting point for any work on Gentzen and his logic. The book is accessible to a wide audience with different backgrounds and is suitable for general readers, researchers, students, and teachers. Information for our distributors: Co-published with the London Mathematical Society beginning with Volume 4. Members of the LMS may order directly from the AMS at the AMS member price.

It is a part of Hindu mythology. One cannot understand Hindu dharma unless one knows Rama and Seeta, Bharata, Lakshmana, Ravana, Kumbhakarna and Hanuman. More details: Mythology cannot be dispensed with. Philosophy alone or rituals alone or mythology alone cannot be sufficient. These are the three strands of all ancient religions. The attitude towards things spiritual which belongs to a particular people cannot be grasped or preserved or conveyed unless we have all these three. To millions of men, women and children in India, the Ramayana is not a mere tale. It has more truth and meaning than the events in one s own life. Just as plants grow under the influence of sunlight, the people of India grow in mental strength and culture by absorbing the glowing inspiration of the Ramayana. The popularity of the book is so great that it has run into forty two impressions ever since it was originally published in the year 1951.	2007-01-01	Motilal Banarsidass Publ.						ZZZ000000

9780932633187	Strategies for real-time system specification	Derek J. Hatley&Imtiaz A. Pirbhai		Integrated, Widely Implemented Techniques for System and Software Developers Here is a casebook, a practical reference, and an indispensable guide for creating a systematic, formal methodology for large, real-time, software-based systems. The book introduces the widely implemented Hatley/Pirbhai methods, a major extension of the DeMarco analysis method describing how external events control the system's operating behavior. The techniques are used in major avionics and electronics companies worldwide, and are automated by most major CASE tools. Large software-based systems, especially those for real-time applications, require multi-mode operation, direct interaction with a rapidly changing physical environment, and fast response times. In the past, the development of such systems was prone to massive cost and schedule overruns, and to inadequate performance and reliability. Strategies for Real-Time System Specification addresses these problems by integrating a finite-state machine structure into classical analysis methods. The book contains nearly 200 diagrams, many of which illustrate the requirements specification of a flight management system for a major avionics developer.	1988	Dorset House						ZZZ000000

9780932633262	Everyday heroes of the quality movement,from Taylor to Deming, the journey to higher productivity	Perry Gluckman&Diana Reynolds Roome		What does it take to make radical or even small-but-crucial changes in an organization's efficiency? What can American industry do to become more productive? Who examines old habits, tries out new systems, and takes the inevitable flack? Everyday Heroes of the Quality Movement addresses those issues with inspiring stories about process improvement and a sympathetic tribute to the people who make change happen.Readers will find their own working lives reflected in the stories of the manager, the buyer, the engineer, the worker, the president, and the consultant. These everyday heroes are individuals who have changed perceptions. They are often unsung, and may risk their livelihood or status to stand out and oppose the old ways.Based on the late Dr. Perry Gluckman's personal experience as a consultant implementing the theories of W. Edwards Deming, these fictionalized accounts let you into the lives of six people who put themselves on the front line of the battle for quality improvement. The stories tell real experiences of people who work in America's companies, from top executives to line workers. What they have in common is the courage to imagine a better working world and the fortitude to put themselves out on a limb to achieve it.	1993-05	Dorset House Pub.						ZZZ000000

9780932633071	General principles of systems design	Gerald M. Weinberg&Daniela Weinberg		Bring a Deeper Understanding of Systems to Software and System Development Originally titled On the Design of Stable Systems in its first, hardcover incarnation, in 1979, General Principles of Systems Design does not just focus on computer systems, but systems of all kinds--human, natural, and technological. In a highly readable, original presentation that embraces everything from depletion curves to the Feedback Principle (the method of controlling a system by reinserting it into the results of its past performance), the Weinbergs explore the subtle art and science of regulating systems, projects, and people in the most efficient and logical manner possible. The authors draw on their respective backgrounds in technology and social science to offer fresh insights and translate them into a language that anyone can understand. In the course of this presentation, the Weinbergs introduce a host of laws and theorems derived from the best thinking of systems thinkers over the past century. In addition to being a reference book for professional and lay people alike, General Principles of Systems Design is suitable as an undergraduate text in the humanities, social, natural, and engineering sciences. It is unique in its approach, highly readable, and offers practical ways of solving problems.	1988-01	Dorset House						ZZZ000000

9780932633453	Systems modeling & requirements specification using ECSAM,an analysis method for embedded and computer-based systems	Jonah Z. Lavi&Joseph Kudish		A Proven Approach to Modeling Operational, Functional, and Design Requirements Discover ECSAM, a method for requirements engineering and the modeling of computer-based systems (CBS). Practiced since 1980 in evolving versions by large numbers of systems and software engineers worldwide, ECSAM was developed in part at Israel Aircraft Industries for the analysis and design of complex reactive embedded systems and software. The method guides engineers in modeling operational, functional, and design requirements, considering both static and dynamic aspects of systems. Readers learn how to - develop conceptual models of the structural and operational properties of computer-based systems and their software, including tasks allocated to their operators and users - systematically develop operational scenarios and use-cases describing the interaction of the system with its environment - elicit and specify functional and nonfunctional requirements - allocate requirements to components of the conceptual model - understand the significance of change and the evolution of requirements - understand the need for tracing and management of requirements throughout the system's life cycle. Core audiences include those involved in the development of complex or mission-critical computer-based systems and their software, systems engineers, computer-based-systems engineers, software engineers and engineering managers, and students at undergraduate and graduate levels.	2005	Dorset House Pub.

9780470832608	Event planning,ethics and etiquette : a principled approach to the business of special event management	Judy Allen		The world of event planning can be alluring and dangerous at once-exotic locales, wining and dining, and people traveling without their spouses. In such situations the line between business and pleasure blurs and the nature of relationships gets cloudy. With a thoughtless act or a less-than-tactful word, long-lasting business relationships can be ruined forever.  Beyond that, budgets are on the chopping block and competition for business is tight. In that environment, people often cut not just financial corners, but the ethical ones, too. There's a fine line between innocent perks and inappropriate gifts or kickbacks. Event planners today must navigate a minefield of potentially sticky situations that can easily blow up in their face. Without a professional code, lines of acceptable behavior are easily crossed. And what you do personally can hurt you professionally.

9780787964665	Instructional engineering in networked environments	Gilbert Paquette		A Dynamic, Research-Based Approach to Knowledge Management In this book, Gilbert Paquette–an internationally recognized expert in the field of technology-based training–offers IT professionals, trainers, and consultants a revolutionary method for going beyond simple information management. Instructional Engineering in Networked Environments introduces the instructional engineering method that elicits knowledge from subject matter experts to make information more widely available for training other people and transfering knowledge through formal and informal training using a variety of media and information sources. Throughout the book, Paquette shows that instructional engineering is based on the use of transferable graphic models that demonstrate how this engineering works in an environment with human networks and diversified information sources. This important book also includes illustrative examples of "artifacts"–the actual job aids that hold an organization’s knowledge–and provides numerous easily reproducible tools. Praise for Instructional Engineering in Networked Environments "The tools and methods developed by Dr. Paquette and his team at LICEF since 1992 are generally regarded by the International Board of Standards for Training, Performance and Instruction (IBSTPI) as world class in every respect. The board believes that an institution or organization embarking on serious efforts in distance and distributed learning would do well to consider these methods and tools as setting a standard." –J. Michael Spector, professor and chair, instructional design, development, and evaluation, Syracuse University; and executive vice president, IBSTPI "Gilbert Paquette’s work is truly world-leading and needs much more exposure. I was so impressed with his detailed models for knowledge engineering in telelearning systems. It was the first time in years that I thought someone had created a breakthrough." –Anne Forster, director, innovation and technology, vice chancellor's office, University of Sydney, Australia "Hydro-Quebec groups over 19,500 employees and employs a staff of around 300 trainers and instructional designers. We have been using the MISA method and the MOT knowledge editor for several years now, and we have not yet found a method as efficient, even though we have had many sales pitches by different vendors." –Gilles Beaulieu, trans energie division, Hydro-Quebec "In this book, Professor Paquette provides one of the most sophisticated tools yet developed for a true technology of instructional engineering. All serious instructional designers will find that this work significantly improves the efficiency and effectiveness of their instructional development efforts." –M. David Merrill, professor, department of instructional technology, Utah State University	2004	John Wiley and Sons						ZZZ000000

9781578083527	Journey of a single cell to a plant	Susan J. Murch&Praveen K. Saxena		In plants, the ability to regenerate identical individuals from single cells is the basis for modern agriculture. These scientific advancements have given us virus-free stocks, novel germplasms, clonal propagation systems, and the commercial introduction of difficult to propagate plant species. The timescale for breeding programs was dramatically reduced as plant tissue culture technologies were developed to shorten the time between generations and reduce the number of generations required for a line to be developed. Without the capacity to regenerate plants, it would not have been possible for plant biotechnology and genetic engineering to have advanced this far. This book contains detailed reviews by the leading scientists who made these discoveries.	2005	Science Publishers						ZZZ000000

9788763001403	Corporate branding,purpose/people/process : towards the second wave of corporate branding	Majken Schultz&Yun Mi Antorini&Fabian F. Csaba		Corporate branding emphasizes that the organization itself, rather than the products created and marketed by the corporation, represents the main point of differentiation and competitive advantage in the marketplace. Despite the wide range of issues the concept raises about organization and strategy, corporate branding has mainly been associated with a marketing and campaign approach. This approach characterizes what the authors have called the first wave of corporate branding. This book argues that the field of corporate branding is undergoing fundamental changes and becoming more cross-disciplinary and strategically driven. This development represents a second wave of corporate branding, explored in the book. The second wave of corporate branding integrates concepts and experiences from strategy, marketing, corporate communication, corporate identity and organization theory. It questions core concepts of classic branding and offers a framework dedicated to the conceptual and practical development of organizations as brands. The book addresses three core themes: purpose, people, and process. What is the purpose of corporate branding as an organization-wide effort in a situation where all competing organizations claim to be unique? What are the roles of internal and external stakeholders in corporate brand building? Which processes and changes does the implementation of a corporate brand involve? Throughout the book, the authors confront the challenges and dilemmas of corporate brand management and offer new insights into how corporate brands can be studied and managed. While this book is primarily aimed at graduate and doctorate students, it also is of relevance to practitioners with an interest in moving beyond traditional mindsets in branding.	2005	Copenhagen Business School Press DK						ZZZ000000

9781558608870	Network analysis, architecture and design	James D. McCabe		The landscape of networking has changed so that network services have now become one of the most important factors to the success of many third generation networks. It has become an important feature of the designer's job to define the problems that exist in his network, choose and analyze several optimization parameters during the analysis process, and then prioritize and evaluate these parameters in the architecture and design of the system.Network Analysis, Architecture, and Design, 2e, uses a systems methodology approach to teaching these concepts, which views the network (and the environment it impacts) as part of the larger system, looking at interactions and dependencies between the network and its users, applications, and devices. This approach matches the new business climate where customers drive the development of new services and the book discusses how networks can be architected and designed to provide many different types of services to customers. This second edition contains an entirely new focus on network architecture, which completes the process from analysis to design. Network architecture takes the input from network analysis and provides a high-level view of the network, focusing on the relationships between major functions of the network, such as security, network management, performance and addressing and routing. A reference architecture, outlining how these functions are to be addressed within the network, serves as the foundation for the network design. With a number of examples, analogies, instructor tips, and exercises, this book works through the processes of analysis, architecture, and design step by step, giving network designers a solid resource for making good design decisions* Substantial revision of the very popular first edition--Practical Computer Network Analysis and Design--by a seasoned network architect who has led numerous design projects in government, commercial, and academic spaces. * Effective examples, case studies, worksheets, and end-of-chapter exercises provide professionals and students with the necessary tools for learning important design issues.* Shows how to architect and design a network to provide the desired services and performance levels, and to choose the appropriate network technologies and interconnection strategies to meet architectural and design goals.*Instructors can download the solutions to the exercises in the book by clicking on the "Instructors" resource link in the upper right corner of the screen and searching for author "McCabe."	2003-04-22	Morgan Kaufmann						ZZZ000000

9781563270444	TPM for America,what it is and why you need it	Herbert R. Steinbacher&Norma L. Steinbacher		Can American Manufacturer's Answer the Challenge? "Gaining a hidden edge through improved maintenance" Maintenance can account for as much as 40 percent of manufacturing costs; yet, many manufacturers still fail to recognize the value of making total productive maintenance (TPM) an integral part of their strategy. Written specifically for American manufacturers by an American TPM practitioner and educator, this book provides a succinct account of TPM's evolution into the most effective maintenance approach in the history of manufacturing. The author surveys the current status of TPM implementation in the United States and challenges American manufacturers to overhaul their current maintenance procedures and by doing so, improve their capacity to stay competitive in the world market. He discusses the steps needed to breakdown the cultural resistance that can impede needed change, from initiation to implementation to institutionalization. He then explains the various facets that make up an overall maintenance strategy including predictive, corrective, and preventative maintenance, as well as ways to make many of these functions automated. With a fully implemented TPM program, organizations can anticipate maintenance needs and build a plan that will eradicate all but a fraction of their associated costs, and in doing so, dramatically improve the bottom line.	1993	Productivity Press						ZZZ000000
9781563271069	Thoughtware,change the thinking and the organization will change itself	J. Philip Kirby&David Hughes		People's thinking is the basis for everything they do - all behavior is rooted in thought. The sum of people's thinking and their collective interaction is the mastermind of the organization's performance. It is the underlying platform on which every organization operates. An analogy to computer software makes sense here: new operating platforms and master programs are installed in order to allow other programs to operate and function effectively. Thoughtware is the operating platform of the organization. Change the thoughtware and the organization will change itself and create the capability to handle the future. Kirby and Hughes use an entertaining, creative, and engaging style to describe the cornerstones of the new thoughtware platform and illustrate how new thoughtware can generate order-of-magnitude change at every level.	1997-07-21	Productivity Press						ZZZ000000

9783540672401	Asymptotic methods in quantum mechanics,application to atoms, molecules, and nuclei	S. H. Patil&K. T. Tang		This book describes some general properties of wave functions, with an emphasis on their asymptotic behaviour. The asymptotic region is particularly important since it is the wave function in the outer region of an atom, a molecule or a nucleus, which is sensitive to external interaction. An analysis of these properties helps in constructing simple and compact wave functions and in developing a broad understanding of different aspects of the quantum mechanics of many-particle systems. As applications, wave functions with correct asymptotic forms are used to generate a large data base for susceptibilities, polarizabilities, interatomic potentials, and nuclear densities.	2000	Springer						ZZZ000000

9781931914222	Why knot?,an introduction to the mathematical theory of knots	Colin Adams&Colin Conrad Adams		Colin Adams, well-known for his advanced research in topology and knot theory, is the author of this exciting new book that brings his findings and his passion for the subject to a more general audience. This beautifully illustrated comic book is appropriate for many mathematics courses at the undergraduate level such as liberal arts math, and topology. Additionally, the book could easily challenge high school students in math clubs or honors math courses and is perfect for the lay math enthusiast.Each copy of Why Knot? is packaged with a plastic manipulative called the Tangle R. Adams uses the Tangle because "you can open it up, tie it in a knot and then close it up again." The Tangle is the ultimate tool for knot theory because knots are defined in mathematics as being closed on a loop. Readers use the Tangle to complete the experiments throughout the brief volume.Adams also presents a illustrative and engaging history of knot theory from its early role in chemistry to modern applications such as DNA research, dynamical systems, and fluid mechanics.

9781584887485	Capillary flows with forming interfaces	Y. D. Shikhmurzaev		Capillary Flows with Forming Interfaces explores numerous theoretical problems that arise in the mathematical description of capillary flows. It focuses on developing a unified approach to a variety of seemingly very different capillary flows of practical importance where classical fluid mechanics leads to nonphysical results.The book begins with a review of the conceptual framework of fluid mechanics and then proceeds to analyze the roots of singularities, such as the moving contact-line problem and the capillary breakup problem. The author then examines how different singular flows can be described as particular cases of a general physical phenomenon of interface formation. He illustrates the developed mathematical models and experimentally verifies them through a number of example problems relevant to engineering applications.The conceptual framework provided in this reference enables further progress in developing mathematical models of capillary flows.The book also allows readers to make informed strategic choices regarding available numerical codes and the in-house development of these codes.	2008	Chapman & Hall/CRC						ZZZ000000

Do not pay too much attention to the advice or suggestions of those around you: do not believe that any one can know, better than yourself, what is right for you. Listen to what others have to say, but always form your own conclusions. Close your ears to all adverse suggestions. Never mind if people call you a fool and a dreamer. Dream on. Remember that Bonaparte, the half-starved lieutenant, always saw himself as the general of armies and the master of France, and he became in out-ward realization what he held him self to be in mind. So likewise will you.		QFORD						ZZZ000000

9788189975630	Broken Nest And Other Stories	Mohanty Sharmi		This selection of Rabindranath Tagore's stories exemplifies his remarkable ability to enter the complexities of human relationships. Within seemingly simple plots, Tagore portrays with extraordinary compassion and lyricism the predicament of women in traditional Bengali contexts, moving from the loneliness of an intelligent, beautiful woman neglected by her husband in the Nobel Laureate's acclaimed novella Broken Nest, to the powerlessness of a young girl whose prized possession is taken away in Notebook, from the casual abandonment of an orphan in Postmaster, to a girl robbed of her childhood in The Ghat's Tale. Powerful, brilliant and astute, the novella and three short stories included in this collection - translated here by acclaimed fiction writer Sharmistha Mohanty, who has brought into English the music of Tagore's narratives - are Tagore's finest prose works.	2009	Westland Books Pvt.

9788187671732	Marrying Off Mother And Other Stories	Gerald Durrell		In these eight stories, which feature the author himself, naturalist Durrell contrasts human and animal behavior. The entire collection is prefaced by an epigram from Ambrose Bierce's Devil's Dictionary : Bride--a woman with a fine prospect of happiness behind her. The reader soon finds the same prospect, for the epigram's minimal relevance indicates the problem: Durrell does not seem to know when he has made his point. The title story shows how the author's widowed mother cleverly stops her meddlesome children from trying to get her remarried. Retirement aims for profundity with the sudden death of a retiring sea captain but becomes silly. The Jury, about a hangman in Paraguay haunted by his victims, has potential but grows tired and predictable. There are many wonderfully descriptive passages and images, but they ramble. A valiant effort drowned by purple prose. Not recommended.	1996	Westland Books Pvt. Ltd						ZZZ000000
