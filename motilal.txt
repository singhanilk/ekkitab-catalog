9788120831940	Approaching the Land of Bliss:Religious Praxis in the Cult of Amitabha	Richard Karl Payne&Kenneth K. Tanaka	Hardcover	The discourse on Buddhist studies has traditionally been structured around texts and nations (the transmission of Buddhism from India to China to Japan).  And yet, it is doubtful that these categories reflect in any significant way the organizing themes familiar to most Buddhists.  It could be argued that cultic practices associated with particular buddhas and bodhisattvas are more representative of the way Buddhists conceive of their relation to tradition.  This volume aims to explore this aspect of Buddhism by focusing on one of its most important cults, that of the Buddha Amitabha.  Approaching the land of Bliss is a rich collection of studies of texts and ritual practices devoted to Amitabha, ranging from Tibet to Japan and from early medieval times to the present.  The cult of Amitabha is identified as an integral part of Tibet's Mahayana Buddhist tradition in the opening essay by Matthew Kapstein.  Next, Daniel Getz Jr., locates the Pure Land patriarch Shengchang more firmly in a Huayan context and his pure Conduct Society not so much in the propagation of Pure Land praxis but as a means of modifying anti-Buddhist sentiments.  Jacqueline Stone's study of the practice of reciting nenbutsu at the time of death gives us an understanding of both the practice itself and the motivating logic behind it.  Kakuban-the founder of the one major schism in the history of the Shingon tradition-isplaced in a typology of Japanese Pure Land thought in James Sanford's study of Kakuban's Amida Hishaku.  Hank Glassman contributes an essay on the subsidiary cult of Chujohime, which derived from the cult of Amitabha but grew to such importance that it displaced the latter as the focus of worship in medieval Japan.  In his examination of radical Amidism, Fabio Rambelli discusses different forms of Japanese Pure Land thought that constitute  divergences from the main stream or normative forms.  Richard Jaffe examines the work of the seventeenth century cleric Ungo Kiyo, who sought to match his teaching to the needs and capacities of his disciples.  Tod Lewis highlights the importance of cultic life and finds traces of the desire for rebirth in Sukhavati in stupa worship among Newari Buddhists.  Charles Jones' thick description of a one-day recitation retreat in Taiwan provides us with a closer look at how the cult of Amitabha continues in present-day East Asia.  Approaching the Land of Bliss moves beyond the limitations of defining Buddhism in terms of its textual corpus or nation states, opening up the cult of Amitabha in Nepal, Tibet, China and Taiwan, and uncovering new aspects of Japanese Pure Land.	2008	Motilal Banarsidass	304	English				ZZZ000000

9788120832930	Buddhists, Brahmins, and Belief:Epistemology in South Asian Philosophy of Religion	Dan Arnold	Hardcover	In Buddhists, brahmins, and belief, Dan arnold examines how the Brahmanical tradition of Purva Mimamsa and the writings of the seventh-century Buddhist Madhyamika philosopher Candrakirti challenged dominant Indian Buddhist views of epistemology.  Arnold retrieves these two very different but equally important voices of philosophical dissent, showing them to have developed highly sophisticated and cogent critiques of influential Buddhist epistemologists such as Dignaga and Dharmakirti.  His analysis developed in conversation with modern Western philosophers like William Alston and J.L. Austin-offers an innovative reinterpretattion of the Indian philosophical tradition, while suggesting that premodern Indian thinkers have much to contribute to contemporary philosophical debates.  In logically distinct ways, Purva Mimamsa and Candrakirti's Madhyamaka opposed the influential Buddhist school of thought that emphasized the foundational character of perception.  Arnold argues that Mimamsaka arguments concerning the intrinsic validity of the earliest Vedic scriptures are best understood as a critique of the tradition of Buddhist philosophy stemming from Dignaga.  Though often dismissed as antithetical to real philosopy,  Mimamsaka thought has affinities with the reformed epistemology that has recently influenced contemporary philosophy of religion.  Candrakirti's arguments, in contrast, amount to a principled refusal of epistemology.  Arnold contends that Candrakirti marshals against Buddhist foundationalism an approach that resembles twentieth-century ordinary language philosophy-and does so by employing what are finally best understood as transcendental arguments.  The conclusion that Candrakirti's arguments thus support a metaphysical claim represents a bold new understanding of Madhyamaka.	2008	Motilal Banarsidass	318	English				ZZZ000000
9788120833609	Bodily Self-Sacrifice in Indian Buddhist Literature	Reiko Ohnuma	Hardcover	This is the first comprehensive study of a central narrative theme in premodern South Asian Buddhist literature: the Buddha's bodily self- sacrifice during his previous lives as a bodhisattva. Conducting close readings of stories from Sanskrit, Pali, Chinese, and Tibetan literature written between the third century B.c.e. and the late medieval period, Reiko Ohnuma argues that this theme has had a major impact on the development of Buddhist philosophy and culture. Whether he takes the form of king, prince, ascetic, elephant, hare, serpent, or god, the bodhisattva repeatedly gives his body or parts of his flesh to others. He leaps into fires, drowns himself in the ocean, rips out his tusks, gouges out his eyes, and lets mosquitoes drink from his blood, always out of selflessness and compassion and to achieve this highest state of Buddhahood. Ohnuma places these stories into a discrete subgenre of South Asian Buddhist literature and approaches them like case studies, analyzing their plots, characterizations, and rhetoric. She then relates the theme of the Buddha's bodily self-sacrifice to major conceptual discourses in the history of Buddhism and South Asian religions, such as the categories of the gift, the body (both ordinary and extraordinary) , kingship, sacrifice, ritual offering, and death. The work reveals a very sophisticated and influential perception of the body in South Asian Buddhist literature and highlights the way in which these stories have provided an important cultural resource for Buddhists. Combined with her rich and careful translations of classic texts, Ohnuma introduces a whole new understanding of a vital concept in Buddhists studies	2008	Motilal Banarsidass	372	English				ZZZ000000
9788120832480	Buddhist Studies	Richard F. Gombrich  /  Cristina Scherrer-Schaub	Hardback	The impressive growth of Buddhist Studies in recent years is the result of several factors.  Important collections of manuscripts have been found, and monuments unearthed, in nearly all parts of Asia where Buddhism existed; political and social events bringing East and West together have increased interest in both scholarly research and Buddhist religious practices.  The spread of Buddhism outside its birthplace, Madhyadesa, first in India and soon throughout Asia, prompted its followers constantly to invent new discursive strategies and to adjust the rules to local customs and administrations.  The essays presented here illustrate how why Buddhist literature adapted to a new and specific context, particularly in North-west India.  They also discuss hermeneutical and exegetical practices of Indian Buddhism, the complex interrelation between the Brahmanical and the Buddhist milieu, as well as the role of the social and political context in determining the rules of the monastic code (vinaya).	2008	Motilal Banarsidass	264	English				ZZZ000000
