When these are traced on the highest and the most massive mountains on the planet, this chronicle of light turns into an aesthetic experience. Ashok Dilwaii starts by recording the footprints of the dark, captures the circling of the constellations in his nocturnal photography, moves on to the pre-twilight hours of rose-shadow, mauve-shadow to the moment when just the jagged line of mountain peaks emerge, while the body of the mountain is still coated with night. Then comes the moment, when in Khayyam's words, the Sultan's turret is struck by a shaft of light.'Dawn to dark' has been set through a play of light, made rich with poetic expressions of mountains and peppered by the photographer's spine-chilling experiences in his own words. This is not just another book on the pretty Himalayas; this is a statement of a photographer's work on one serious subject involving a whole lifetime!	2007	Prakash Books	180	English			1	ZZZ000000

While Sikhism developed and flourished recently, itsnuances have not been fully absorbed in all sections of society.

She alsobrings light to bear on the importance, within the Sikh cultural and religiousheritage, of shabads or hymns and the Adi Granth, the book of learning thatdefines the Sikh way of living in the absence of idols or images of God. Alongwith this she also brings reference to the Gurbani, the Gurmat (or thought), theGuru ka Langar through which the devout and the hungry are fed in a service akinto serving God, as also the community's architectural heritage, best representedthrough the Golden Temple in Amritsar.

It is a great occasion for festivities. Among the Hindus, it is a widespread belief that marriage links man and woman physically, socially, and morally.

Banks and other financial institutions are more prone to attacks by this virus in spite of the presence of foolproof systems. But systems do not execute themselves. It is therefore equally important to learn how and why things go wrong. Many individuals fall prey to the temptation of easy money. And to make matters worse they feel they can outsmart others and cover their misdeeds. This book is a compilation of short-stories on how a particular fraud or forgery was planned, attempted and was successful. All the individuals involved were, however, later caught and punished according to the crime committed. This aspect, however, has been deliberately legt hanging, so that the actual happening does not get diluted. The emphasis is thus on the modus operandi only and the actual situation as happened has been laid out bare for the reader to look at.	2006	Prakash Books	196	English			1	ZZZ000000

It is the sanctuary of the main Asian religions, Hinduism, Buddhism, and Shamanism, where most traditions have been left untouched by foreign influences. In fact, the Kathmandu Valley keeps itself alive with the antique traditions of the virginity cult. The living Goddess or the Kumari Devi is the most important character for any traditional Nepalese. She is the Goddess protecting the country and it is only after her benediction that the King of Nepal had the permission to lead the country's affairs for the following year. Nepal is also a sanctuary of nature and races. Its climate, flora and fauna are extremely rich and shelter a number of ethnic groups. These little groups live precariously within harsh natural elements, through heat and cold, subtropical rains and high altitude deserts, and have astonishing communal organisations, which could be considered as a model in our modern society. The arts of Nepal are splendid and in plenty. The country is known of course for its architectural treasures mainly present in the Katmandu valley. The wooden sculptures of their struts are unique in the world as are the excellent golden bronzes admired in the public places and the numerous temples of Buddhist and Hindu religions. The Buddhist Thangka paintings are world famous and the murals of the monasteries and temples evoke envy. Nepal is home to mysterious festivals and many rituals are still practiced with as much faith and belief as they were centuries ago. Festivals to call the rain through Macchendranath, to celebrate the memory of the dead, to thank the God of rains after the season and celebrate the protective Goddess of the nation and later the call of the Goddess of Wealth Laxmi to shower riches on the family. It is endless, there is more than a festival a day. Only the people of each of the different communities are aware of their own fetes. Nepal is a place of rich and multiple activities, full of diversities, a refuge of races and the cultures they elaborate. Contents : 1. Looking Back / 2. Exploring the Land of the Gods / 3.

If its forts and palaces and tales of valour are a common thread running through its stirring history, Rajasthan's contradictions too lie in its people, in the way in which festivals are celebrated, the manner in which they dress, drape themselves in colours, ornament their bodies and their homes. And yet, these differences too are part of the pattern into which society in Rajasthan has come to be represented, symbolically as well as practically. Within its folds, there is a rich culture of religions and gods, heroes and deities; of arts and crafts so varied and so exquisite, it is difficult to believe they are the creation of a people that have been nurtured out of necessity.	1999	Prakash Books	188	English			1	ZZZ000000

If its monks and monasteries and tales of masked dances are a common thread running through its stirring history, Sikkim's synchronization also lie in its peace loving Lepchas, Bhutias and Nepalese, the way in which festivals are celebrated amid snow clad peaks, the manner in which they drape themselves in colours and ornament their bodies and their homes. From an independent kingdom to a robust state of India, the world of the Sikkimese under the benign shadow of Mt Khangchendzonga, the third highest mountain in the world and and revered by them as the guardian deity is still a Shangri-La where Hindu and Buddhist shrimes dot the sacred groves.	2008	Prakash Books	168	English			1	ZZZ000000

Though they have come a long way since their moments of glory and pathos, yet many misconceptions about the place continue to exist. And, therein lies the germ of the book which is an attempt to capture the true essence of these islands and portray them with the great felicity they deserve. The text is accompanied by images that interpret and unravel each story and help one navigate through the book which is a product of years of research, exploration and compilation of facts. The book's size, as well as time frame, is colossal. But, the islands are so multi-faceted that to fully-comprehend their verve one has to view them in their entirety. The book, which is absorbing, continually captivating and perhaps the next best thing to a visit, also helps one better understand the six tribal communities of the islands - their origins and ancestry, geographic distribution, socio-economic activities, legends, beliefs and folktales. Likewise, the island's tragic history, reflected in its impressive monuments, make you pause and ponder at the pointless destruction of life and liberty whereas the beauty and bounty of its open spaces add to the sensory abundance of being part of the quintessence of nature.	2006	Prakash Books	228	English			1	ZZZ000000

Massive and looming against a monsoon sky and delicately fragile on a misty winter morning, bright and brittle on a bright sunny afternoon and dreamlike by moonlight, the Taj takes on a new aspect with every passing moment. Responsive to faint shifts of light, to the play of clouds and the drama of sunrise and sunset, the Taj Mahal continues to entrance visitors regardless of how often they go to see this monument, built by a Mughal monarch for his beloved wife. Rupinder Khullar has been photographing the Taj for several years. He shares his knowledge of its architecture and the arts that went into its embellishment with us in this splendid celebration of one of the world's greatest buildings.	2006	Prakash Books	240	English			1	ZZZ000000

Delhi contains some excellent specimens of Indo-Islamic architecture: the Qutb Minar -an admirably sculptured gateway, the Tughlaqabad fort - a magnificent citadel built in rugged surroundings; the Red Fort - an example of grand palace architecture; the Jama Masjid - a simple but majestic royal mosque, Delhi has been the coveted capital of many empires. Battles over possession of the city have left it a mere skeleton of its former splendour but enough remains to bear testimony to its rich and glorious past. If there is any place in India which presents a panorama of 3000 years of continuous habitation and centuries of architectural activity, it is Delhi.	2006	Prakash Books	96	Spanish			1	ZZZ000000

Mahoba and the fort of Kalinjar were its power centres, but it was in Khajuraho that the greatly chronicled Chandella dynasty chose to build its temples. Today, many of the reasons for choosing Khajuraho as a site for the kingdom's great temple building remain obscure. A small village in the Chattarpur district of Madhya Pradesh, Khajuraho is all but surrounded by wilderness in the midst of a hilly forested belt. When the Chandellas declined in power, Khajuraho for all practical purposes, was lost to the world, its magnificent temples succumbing to centuries of abandonment.

In 1801 Ranjit Singh was proclaimed the first Sikh Maharaja of the Panjab, the 'land of the five rivers', at Lahore. The magnificent illustrations include jewellery and gemstones from his treasury and the paintings, luxurious textiles, gold-decorated weapons and armour of his reign. The book also tells the little-known story of the continuing tradition of the later Sikh kingdoms after the Annexation of the Panjab by the British in 1849, as well as the beguiling friendship between the deposed Maharaja Dalip Singh and Queen Victoria. The Arts of the Sikh Kingdoms is published to coincide with the 300th anniversary of a pivotal event in Sikh history, when Guru Gobind Singh (the last of the ten Sikh Gurus) initiated five of his followers to create the Khalsa, or 'Order of the Pure'. Following this, men adopted the name Singh (lion) and the women Kaur (princess), a tradition which, along with customs such as the wearing of turbans, remains to this day.	1999	Prakash Books	256	English			1	ZZZ000000

It is, the polar opposite of 'Malgudi Days' in that all characters are real and the situations, factual. However, the recollection of childhood days through the prism of nearly half-a-century of subsequent existence must necessarily be somewhat refracted. The mind, according to Tagore, is a painter not a camera. It records facts idiosyncratically adding colour according to its own whim and fancy, when and where it pleases. Akira Kurosawa endorses this viewpoint by exploiting this facet of the human mind brilliantly in his film Rashomon. These stories are therefore, ahistoric, purely personalmemoirs.	2007	Prakash Books	n 106	English			1	ZZZ000000

Phrases such as 'living like a Maharaja' or the 'movie Mogul' transport one to India's glorious past. This is not just a conjecture; it is a picture strewn across Indian mythological tales, where lavishness of divine palaces was synonymous with happiness and was described in detail. 'The wonder that was India' has become part of the folklore that we spin out for the young. And it isn't just palaces that have been described in great detail but the fabled jewels of the Rajas and Maharajas as well, who ruled right up to the twentieth century. It was the only source of diamonds before they were discovered in South Africa. The Nizam of Hyderabad, for example, had a 184.5-carat Jacob Diamond as paper-weight on his study table!. India also has a rich legacy of architecture, sculpture and paintings that dates back to thousands of years. The Buddhist Stupa at Sanchi dates back to the second century BC and is the earliest evidence of Indian architectural skills. It would be unfair to make just a brief mention of the heritage art that includes sites like the Ajanta and Ellora Caves, the temples of Khajuraho, the marvellous work of Mughal Architecture - inclusive of the very famous 'Taj Mahal' - (where the marble of the tomb is inlaid with semi-precious stones) and many more. The tapestry of India's cultural heritage is so rich that there are more than twenty-two monuments that have been marked as World Heritage Monuments by UNESCO.  It is against this background that this, "India in Luxury" has been compiled. This luxuriously illustrated volume showcases the finest accommodation available in India, and also offers you glimpses of the cities where these resorts are located. Time-honored building techniques and the traditional decor that was becoming extinct, was revived to create these oases of luxury. Contents : 1. Jaipur; 2. Udaipur; 3. Agra; 4. Ranthambhore; 5.

In an ambitious attempt, the book looks at these species from the point of view of distribution of forests, trees and shrubs, the ancient structure of the crust of the desert, and the food chain that has led to the proliferation and, in some cases, the extinction or near-extinction of some species of wildlife. The book is illustrated with colour plates, photographs taken by naturalists and conservators who have spent several occasions in the wilderness recording these events. This superb book is not only a tribute to the natural wealth of Rajasthan but will also go a long way in helping those people for whom the countryside holds so much enchantment.	1998	Prakash Books	188	English			1	ZZZ000000

BOWRON	PaperBack	Conventional wisdom has it that humiliation is a bad thing (at least for the person it's happening to - let's face it, for everyone watching, it's fantastic entertainment). There is, however, a school of thought which holds that humiliation can actually be a good thing (in a twisted, masochistic, certifiable sort of way). It's not a very large school, and probably not one that you'd fight to have your children attend, but it's there, The theory goes that humiliation. Total Humiliation, is the only state from which True Enlightenment can be achieved. A proponent of this dictum, author Fiona Bowron, shows us how we have been approaching the Enlightenment problem from entirely the wrong angle. We have followed the lifestyle gurus in pursuit of the impossible goal of achieving an ordered and organised life.	2004	NEW HOLLAND PUBLISHE	96	English			1	ZZZ000000

Its so easy to do the oppositeto cling to others expecting to be taken care of, to control people and blame them when things go wrong, to be insincere and play at relationships and careers rather than commit, to tease rather than respond, and to live on thefringe of others lives rather than in the middle of your own.	2004	TATA MCGRAW HILL	272	English			1	ZZZ000000

Down the winding roads of Sonekote, zips a ghostly blood-red Jaguar. Along with Kavita and Cyclone Shaila, Anirudh must uncover the secrets of the misty, secluded hill-sides. Red Jaguar takes our hero on the most exciting ride of his life. High in the Himalayas, a bird of prey waits and watches as Mrs Samson and her troupe of five: Sangeeta, the bug freak; the brothers, Billy and Lokesh; Aarti, haunted by the death of her parents in the same silent mountains and Anirudh trek their way through the lonely landscape. Adventure, ghosts, and mystery await Anirudh and his strange friends in these three stories.	2006-05-05	Rupa & Co.						ZZZ000000
9788185822235	Arts and Crafts of Rajasthan	Aman Nath&Francis Wacziarg		In the context of the arts and crafts, Rajasthan has been a land of great patronage. Its geographic locale linked it to the Middle East and Europe. As blood mixed - in both war and peace - the cultures intermingled, bringing new skills, palettes and textures. This book opens a new world of arts and crafts. It highlights the interrelatedness of various crafts. The text also traces how most of Rajasthan's crafts - unlike other parts of India where most crafts developed to answer royal needs - developed to fulfill rural needs.	1994	Mapin publishing						ZZZ000000

But something is missing in her life. So, one cold November morning Veronika decides to die. She takes a handful of sleeping pills expecting never to wake up. But she does -- at a mental hospital where she is told that she has only days to live. This poignant international bestseller by the author of The Alchemist takes readers on a quest to find meaning in a culture overshadowed by angst, soulless routine, and pervasive conformity. Based on events in Coelho's own life, Veronika Decides to Die questions the meaning of madness and celebrates individuals who do not fit into patterns society considers to be normal. Bold and illuminating, it is a dazzling portrait of a young woman at the crossroads of despair and liberation, and a poetic, exuberant appreciation of each day as a renewed opportunity.	2000	HarperCollins						ZZZ000000

9780007120284	Why Us?,How Science Rediscovered the Mystery of Ourselves	James Le Fanu		The imperative to 'know thyself' is both fundamental and profoundly elusive ' for how can we ever truly comprehend the drama and complexity of the human experience?In 'Why Us?' James Le Fanu offers a fascinating exploration of the power and limits of science to penetrate the deep mysteries of our existence, challenging the certainty that has persisted since Charles Darwin's 'Origin of Species' that we are no more than the fortuitous consequence of a materialist evolutionary process.That challenge arises, unexpectedly, from the two major projects that promised to provide definitive proof for this most influential of scientific theories. The first is the astonishing achievement of the Human Genome Project, which, it was anticipated, would identify the genetic basis of those characteristics that distinguish humans from their primate cousins. The second is the phenomenal advance in brain imaging that now permits neuroscientists to observe the brain 'in action' and thus account for the remarkable properties of the human mind.But that is not how it has turned out. It is simply not possible to get from the monotonous sequence of genes along the double helix to the near infinite diversity of the living world, nor to translate the electrical firing of the brain into the creativity of the human mind. This is not a matter of not knowing all the facts. Rather, science has inadvertently discovered that its theories are insufficient to conjure the wonder of the human experience from the bare bones of our genes and brains.We stand on the brink of a tectonic shift in our understanding of ourselves that will witness the rediscovery of the central premise of Western philosophy that there is 'more than we can know'. Lucid, compelling and utterly engaging, 'Why Us?' offers a convincing and provocative vision of the new science of being human.	2010-04-29	HarperCollins Publishers Limited						SOC002000

Best known as the creator of Hercule Poirot and Miss Jane Marple, her prolific output would bring her publisher William Collins at least one book every year. Twenty of her contemporary crime novels were to feature neither Poirot or Marple, instead a wide range of ingenious plots would be played out by a selection of amateur sleuths, professional detectives, young adventuresses or unwary bystanders caught up in unforeseen events.This collection of five omnibuses gathers together the twenty stand-alone novels, presenting them chronologically and providing a fascinating window on a changing world though six decades of investigation. Presented in this way, recurring characters - including Superintendent Battle, Tommy and Tuppence Beresford, Colonel Johnny Race and Ariadne Oliver - rub shoulders with many who would appear only in one book, and the result is a selection of some of the finest mystery writing ever.

These young men ndash; and women ndash; found themselves facing life-threatening danger and the kind of responsibility few would be prepared to shoulder today. Whether fighting in the jungles of Burma or on the D-Day beaches, as submariners, pilots, spies or prisoners of war, young soldiers in WWII displayed astonishing courage and resilience, united by honour and bound by the fellowship of their comrades. Those who made it home are now a passing generation, and for many this is the last chance for them to tell their stories ndash; men like football legend Tom Finney, who saw action in southern Italy; or James Bond set-designer Ken Adam, a German Jew who flew as a fighter pilot for the RAF; or identical twins Tom and Dee Bowles, who landed together on Easy Red beach on D-Day. Many of these young men never returned home and those who did faced insurmountable challenges assimiliating back into civilian life. 'Heroes' is a moving and uplifting tribute to an remarkable generation.	2007-08-06	HarperCollins Publishers Limited						ZZZ000000

Choosing to reject humanity and compassion, Devadatta's journey will mould him into Buddha's greatest adversary.Originated in the 1970s, Buddha is Osamu Tezuka's unparalleled rendition of the life and times of Prince Siddhartha.Tezuka's storytelling genius and consummate skill at visual expression blossom fully as he contextualizes the Buddha's ideas; with an emphasis on, action, emotion, humour and conflict as Prince Siddhartha runs away from home, travels across India and questions Hindu practices such as ascetic self-mutilation and caste oppression.Rather than recommend resignation and impassivity, Tezuka's Buddha predicates enlightenment upon recognizing the interconnectedness of life, having compassion for the suffering, and ordering one's life sensibly, his approach is slightly irreverent in that it incorporates something that Western commentators often eschew, namely, humour.June 20, 2005Buddha Wins the 2005 Harvey Award for Best American Edition of Foreign Material.	2006	HarperCollins						ZZZ000000

9780007245130	Burning Bright	Tracy Chevalier		Flames and funerals, circus feats and seduction, neighbours and nakedness: Tracy Chevalier's novel Burning Bright sparkles with drama. London 1792. The Kellaways move from familiar rural Dorset to the tumult of a cramped, unforgiving city. They are leaving behind a terrible loss, a blow that only a completely new life may soften. Against the backdrop of a city jittery over the increasingly bloody French Revolution, a surprising bond forms between Jem, the youngest Kellaway boy, and streetwise Londoner Maggie Butterfield. Their friendship takes a dramatic turn when they become entangled in the life of their neighbour, the printer, poet and radical, William Blake. He is a guiding spirit as Jem and Maggie navigate the unpredictable, exhilarating passage from innocence to experience. Their journey inspires one of Blake's most entrancing works. Georgian London is recreated as vividly in Burning Bright as 17th-century Delft was in Tracy Chevalier's bestselling masterpiece, Girl with a Pearl Earring.	2007	HarperCollins						ZZZ000000

Eventually their native radical fantasies turn into a chaos of real destruction, but the aftermath is not as exciting as they had hoped. Nonetheless, while they may not have changed the world, their lives will never be the same again...	2007	Harper Perennial						ZZZ000000

(3) Breathes really loudly when he's asleep - 'I wasn't SNORING' - so that it's like being woken every night at 2am by Darth Vader. And not in a sexy, black cloak, galaxy ruling sort of way. (4) Says, 'I'm putting you in charge of that' as if he's doing her a favour when he wants to get out of doing something. (5) Says, 'Well, let's not make a problem out of it, shall we?' before ignoring the thing she's just told him about that's really bugging her and that she wants him to fix. (6) Doesn't fix things the minute she asks him to. (7) Manages to get the children to bed with far less yelling than she does. (8) Always sees the other side in an argument, i.e., the side that isn't hers. (10) Adores her mother. Viciously funny, touchingly honest and only too true, this is Stephanie Calman at her brilliant best.	2010	Pan Macmillan						ZZZ000000

9780330465090	The Swansong of Wilbur McCrum	Bronia Kita		Wilbur McCrum has always been a drifter. Abandoned by his parents, one after the other, and subsequently passed from pillar to post, he was still a young lad when he first took to the road, and somehow he's never settled anywhere since. When he meets Ida May, however, that looks set to change: finally, Wilbur's dream of making a home, a family, and a future for himself, looks set to become reality. But fate's a funny old thing, and Wilbur never has had much luck . . . 'With a hugely likeable narrator, and a narrative that gallops along at the breakneck pace of a runaway steer, I loved the energy of the writing, and the way the world of the Wild West is painted so clearly in swift, deft strokes. A terrific and unusual voice' Kate Long 'Kita's gold-rush setting incorporates all the dusty heroism of the Wild West. But Wilbur McCrum is the book's truly unforgettable element. His folksy speech and wry humour are engaging and unrelenting, taking the reader from a troubled childhood to an old age of reminiscence.

Lily is gone and her twins, Miranda and Eliot, and her husband, the gentle Luc, mourn her absence with unspoken intensity. All is not well with the house, either, which creaks and grumbles and malignly confuses visitors in its mazy rooms, forcing winter apples in the garden when the branches should be bare. Generations of women inhabit its walls. And Miranda, with her new appetite for chalk and her keen sense for spirits, is more attuned to them than she is to her brother and father. She is leaving them slowly -  Slipping away from them -  And when one dark night she vanishes entirely, the survivors are left to tell her story.  "Miri I conjure you "  This is a spine-tingling tale that has Gothic roots but an utterly modern sensibility. Told by a quartet of crystalline voices, it is electrifying in its expression of myth and memory, loss and magic, fear and love.	2009-05-01	Picador						ZZZ000000

9780330510813	Longest Siege,Tobruk: the Battle That Saved North Africa	Robert Lyman		Beginning on 10th April 1941, and lasting for 240 days, the siege of Tobruk is a mesmerising tale of human endurance and heroism. It is an epic story of extraordinary resilience as the Libyan port's 24,000 defenders met increasingly desperate attempts by Rommel's Panzer divisions to break through the hurriedly thrown-up defences. It was a battle of bayonets and grenades against tanks, of David versus Goliath. The eventual allied victory came against overwhelming odds, plus the morale sapping knowledge that the defenders were surrounded on one side by the sea, and on the other by Hitler's men and machines (who, only the year before, had brought Western Europe to its knees). Tobruk was defended in the main by the Australian 9th Division, followed by the British 70th Infantry Division who then linked up with the advancing 8th Army. The Royal Navy also played an important role in Tobruk's defence. By December 1941 Rommel had been beaten and forced to withdraw his forces from Cyrenaica. The siege was lifted and the exhausted, gallant defenders able to march out in triumph.	2010	Pan Books Ltd						ZZZ000000

9780199206872	Shorter Oxford English dictionary on historical principles	Angus Stevenson&Lesley Brown		From the beginning, the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary was intended to be an abridgement of the full Oxford English Dictionary. The first editor, William Little, was appointed in 1902. He worked on it until his death in 1922, after which the dictionary was completed by H. W. Fowler, JessieCoulson, and C. T. Onions. The First Edition was published in 1933, in two volumes. The Second Edition, published in 1936, contained about 3,000 revisions and additions. The Third Edition (1944) contained an appendix of addenda and corrigenda, and this edition was reprinted several times with corrections and additions, the most significant being in 1973, with enlarged addenda (nowrunning to over 70 pages) and a major revision of all the etymologies. The New Shorter was prepared under the editorship of Lesley Brown 1980-1993. It was the first complete revision of the dictionary, being in fact not so much an overhaul of the existing text as a reabridgement of the OED and its Supplements.

The Sixth Edition of the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary provides a complete update of this unique reference work.

9780747591597	The assault on reason	Al Gore		At the time George W. Bush ordered American forces to invade Iraq, 70 per cent of Americans believed Saddam Hussein was linked to 9/11. Voters in Ohio, when asked by pollsters to list what stuck in their minds about the campaign, most frequently named two Bush television ads that played to fears of terrorism. We live in an age when the 30-second television spot is the most powerful force shaping the electorate's thinking, and America is in the hands of an administration less interested than any previous administration in sharing the truth with the citizenry. Related to this and of even greater concern is the current administration's lack of interest in the process by which the truth is ascertained - first among which are an embrace of open inquiry, in which unexpected and even inconvenient facts can lead to unexpected conclusions. How did the US get here? And how much damage has been done to the functioning of American democracy and its role as steward of its national security? Never has there been a worse time for the US to lose the capacity to face the reality of long-term challenges, from national security to the economy, from issues of health and social welfare to the environment. As The Assault on Reason shows us, there is precious little time to waste. Drawing on a life's work in politics as well as on the work of experts across a broad range of disciplines, Al Gore has written a farsighted and powerful manifesto for clear thinking.	2007-05-22	Bloomsbury						ZZZ000000

9780007149537	The Age of Wonder,How the Romantic Generation Discovered the Beauty and Terror of Science	Richard Holmes		Shortlisted for the BBC Samuel Johnson Prize for Non-FictionShortlisted for the Royal Society Prize for Science BookRichard Holmes, prize-winning biographer of Coleridge and Shelley, explores the scientific ferment that swept across Britain at the end of the 18th century in his ground-breaking new biography 'The Age of Wonder'.'The Age of Wonder' is Richard Holmes's first major work of biography in over a decade. It has been inspired by the scientific ferment that swept through Britain at the end of the eighteenth century, 'The Age of Wonder' and which Holmes now radically redefines as 'the revolution of Romantic Science'.The book opens with Joseph Banks, botanist on Captain Cook's first Endeavour voyage, stepping onto a Tahitian beach in 1769, hoping to discover Paradise. Many other voyages of discovery swiftly follow, while Banks, now President of the Royal Society in London, becomes our narrative guide to what truly emerges as an Age of Wonder.Banks introduces us to the two scientific figures that dominate the book: astronomer William Herschel and chemist Humphry Davy. Herschel's tireless dedication to the stars, assisted (and perhaps rivalled) by his comet-finding sister Caroline, changed forever the public conception of the solar system, the Milky Way galaxy and the meaning of the universe itself. Davy first shocked the scientific community with his near-suicidal gas experiments in Bristol, then went on to save thousands of lives with his Safety Lamp and established British chemistry as the leading professional science in Europe. But at the cost, perhaps, of his own heart.Holmes proposes a radical vision of science before Darwin, exploring the earliest ideas of deep time and deep space, the creative rivalry with the French scientific establishment, and the startling impact of discovery on great writers and poets such as Mary Shelley, Coleridge, Byron and Keats. With his trademark sense of the human drama, he shows how great ideas and experiments are born out of lonely passion, how scientific discoveries (and errors) are made, how intense relationships are forged and broken by research, and how religious faith and scientific truth collide. The result is breathtaking in its originality, its story-telling energy, and not least, in its intellectual significance.	2009-09-03	Harper Collins Publ. UK						ZZZ000000

9780007190683	Poirot:The Complete Ariadne Oliver	Agatha Christie		Poirot and Mrs Oliver continue their sleuthing in the 1960s in four uncharacteristically ‘modern’ novels with an added twist of danger. Third Girl Poirot finally admits he is growing old as a perplexed girl thinks she may have killed someone. Here Christie dragged Poirot into the swinging 60s and effectively squared him up against a world featuring sex, drugs and hippies. Hallowe’en Party A teenage murder witness is drowned in a tub of apples. This was only the second time Christie wrote about the death of a child, and is all the more engrossing for it. Elephants Can Remember An old husband and wife double murder has never been solved - until now. This was the very last Poirot story that Agatha Christie wrote, and garnered good reviews. The Pale Horse A priest’s death leads to sinister goings-on in an old country inn. This bonus novel featured Mrs Oliver for once without Poirot and was one of Christie’s darkest stories, blending witchcraft and murder.	2005	HarperCollins						ZZZ000000

Oz, authors of the million-copy bestseller 'YOU: The Owner's Manual', have devised a diet that is so effective you'll notice changes in your body immediately. Starting with a Two-Week Reboot that will help you lose up to two inches around your waist, you will shed your unwanted pounds forever. 'YOU on a Diet' is not another faddy crash-diet weight loss plan: you will lose weight - and a lot of it - but you will also gain the knowledge, insight and power to keep off the pounds you lose. Knowledge is the most powerful motivator when it comes to making the right food choices: know the 'why' and you'll successfully handle the 'how'. Find out your ideal shape and how to reach it. Lose weight without hunger, all you need is just 100 calories less a day. Enjoy flexibility, you can still indulge in treats. Rebalance body chemicals and hormones - these, not willpower, dictate what you eat. Stop worrying about what you weigh, it's your waist size that counts. Roizen and Mehmet's clear plan combined with: Amazing YOU facts (e.g. 95% of your body's serotonin is found in your intestines - there's only 2-3% in your nervous system) · Eating tips (e.g. eating a small handful of nuts before your meal tricks your body into thinking that you are fuller sooner) · Interactive questionnaires (e.g. are your emotions affecting your food choices?) make this diet one of the most cutting-edge and easy-to-follow of our time. Successful long-term weight loss is only found in one place: YOU.	2007	HarperCollins						HEA006000

9780007247394	India,One Man's Personal Journey Round the Subcontinent	Sanjeev Bhaskar		Sanjeev Bhaskar, the comedian and writer behind The Kumars at No. 42 embarks on an epic and highly personal journey through modern India. Sanjeev's characteristic humour and unique take on the country form the heart of this beautifully written travel book that became a Sunday Times bestseller in hardback when it accompanied his BBC series. Exotic and diverse, richly colourful and endlessly complex â India is one of the most exciting countries to visit in the world today. Sanjeev Bhaskar of Goodness Gracious Me has visited his Indian relations there over many years, but this is his chance to delve deeper into what makes this country so fascinating, perplexing and often challenging to visit. As Sanjeev travels from Delhi to Bombay, Jaipur to Calcutta, he meets ordinary and extraordinary Indian people from every background, and brings his natural warmth and sense of humour to these encounters. Although often baffled by the eccentricities of India, our endearingly good-natured guide never fails to find humour in these situations. Sanjeev's India is also a personal journey as Sanjeev meets old relatives who reveal their moving and often traumatic stories of Indian's turbulent and bloody past, and comes to understand a little more about his own roots. During his trip Sanjeev is invited to a middle-class wedding in Delhi as well as witnessing the poverty of the slums in the Calcutta backstreets. He wryly observes the polo-playing Maharajah jet-set in Jaipur as well as the kitsch of Bombay Bollywood, and experiences the Ganges lit up by a million floating candles for the ancient ritual of Diwali as well as the majestic colonial architecture of the British Raj. With such an engaging and thoughtful travelling companion, we find ourselves going beyond the clichés to reveal a country steeped in history yet at the forefront of new technology, at once confusing, astonishing and jaw-droppingly beautiful.	2008-04-07	HarperCollins						ZZZ000000

9780007286751	Collins Gem Palm Reading	Collins Gem		Collins Gem Palm Reading reveals the ancient art of palm reading. With easy-to-follow diagrams accompanying clear and concise text, this book lays bare the complexities of hand reading. The book provides an introduction to how to read palms so that a beginner will soon be able to uncover the hidden truths of the hand. It first examines the whole hand, analysing the variety of hand shapes, including the compatibility of different hand shapes and the influences of hand shape on health and careers. It then examines the fingers and thumb in detail. Palmists look at the shape of the fingers, their flexibility and their position in relation to one another and make predictions about an individual and their compatibility with others. This examination is followed by looking at the āmountsā (the fleshy pads on the palm) and their predictive power and then studying the lines on the palm (an important aspect of palm reading but not the sole element, as suggests by popular myth). By pulling all these aspects of palm reading together this book will enable you to start drawing up predictions from studying palms. To help you the book is heavily illustrated with diagrams and photographs.	2008	HarperCollins						ZZZ000000

9780007307753	India,A History	John Keay		A new edition of the most authoritative and highly-regarded single-volume history of India. Fully revised to include the most recent research and to cover events from partition to the present day.In 'India: A History' five millennia of the sub-continent's history are interpreted by one of our finest writers on India and the Far East. This definitive work combines narrative pace and skill with social, economic and cultural analysis.India's history begins with a highly advanced urban civilisation in the Indus valley, regressing to a tribal and pastoral nomadism, and then evolving into a uniquely stratified society. The pattern of inward invasion plus outward migration was established early: from Alexander the Great via the march of Islam and the great Moghuls to the coming of the East India Company and the establishment of the British Raj.Older, richer and more distinctive than almost any other, India's culture furnishes all that the historian could wish for in the way of continuity and diversity. The peoples of the Indian subcontinent, while sharing a common history and culture, are not now, and never have been, a single unitary state; the book accommodates Pakistan and Bangladesh, as well as other embryonic nation states like the Sikh Punjab, Muslim Kashmir and Assam.In this brilliant new edition, John Keay continues the narrative of India's history -- covering events from partition to the present day and examining the very different fortunes of the three successor states: Pakistan, Bangladesh and the Republic of India. Based on the latest research, this is an indispensible history of a country set to be a definitive influence on the future of world economics, politics and culture.	2010	HarperCollins Publishers Limited						HIS017000

9780007340774	No space, no choice, no jobs	Naomi Klein		'No Logo' was a book that defined a generation, when it was first published in 1999. For it's 10th anniversay Naomi Klein has updated this iconic book.By the time you're twenty-one, you'll have seen or heard a million advertisements. But you won't be happier for it.This is a book about that much-maligned, much-misunderstood generation coming up behind the slackers, who are being intelligent and active about the world in which they find themselves. It is a world in which all that is 'alternative' is sold, where any innovation or subversion is immediately adopted by un-radical, faceless corporations. But, gradually, tentatively, a new generation is beginning to fight consumerism with its own best weapons; and it is the first skirmishes in this war that this abrasively intelligent book documents brilliantly.	2010	Harper Collins Publ.

9788172238162	Sufism - The Heart of Islam	Sadia Dehlvi		About the Book : - This engaging and well-researched narrative provides an insider's understanding of Islam in all its aspects. It elaborates on how Sufism is the preserved spiritual path that forms the heart of Islam. Drawing from an in-depth study of Muslim texts and traditions, the author articulates that Sufism is not an innovation, but the continuity of a thought process that links Muslims to their religious predecessors all the way to Prophet Muhammad.  The book covers the remarkable lives of the early Sufis, their literature, and philosophies that stress on the purification of the heart. It highlights the major Sufi orders, their popularity in the subcontinent and how the teachings of Sufi Masters impacted the devotional aspect of Muslims forever.  This comprehensive account spans from early Islam to the modern day concerns of militant ideologies, arguing how they pose the biggest threat to the classical understanding of the faith. It offers an insightful look at the complex relationship of Sufism with both Muslim and non-Muslim societies. About the Book : -  Sadia Dehlvi is a well-known columnist who writes for leading publications of the subcontinent. Besides editing a monthly Urdu journal for women, she has produced and scripted a number of documentaries and television programmers. For over 30 years, Dehlvi has been engaged in voicing concern on issues regarding heritage, culture, women and Muslim communities.	2010	HarperCollins						ZZZ000000

9780330514064	Day Scholar	Siddharth Chowdhury&Patna Roughcut		About the Book : - Zorawar Singh Shokeen of Chandrawal is one of those Delhi musclemen who run its politics from the shadows. He owns a house in the environs of the University North Campus, which he lets out as a hostel for boys. Occasionally, he uses the hostel to host his mistress, Madam Midha. Otherwise, he recruits from among his young tenants the footsoldiers for his campus campaigns; their leader, a scrawny MA (Previous) student from Bihar -- the legendary Jishnu da. It is 1992, and at this aggressively male world, ordered along the simple principles of caste, class and region, arrive two kids from Patna. The fresh-faced Pranjal Sinha and his up-for-it best friend, and the narrator of Day Scholar, Hriday Thakur.  In the twilight years between adolescence and adulthood, the Shokeen Niwas boys are concerned with elections, girls and examinations. And Hriday, who hopes to be a writer some day, is drawn, like moth to flame, irresistibly to the material they provide. Forsaking his first love, he becomes trapped instead by a series of misjudgements that lead him finally to the doorstep of Madam's house and, in it, her fourteen-year-old apple-cheeked daughter Sonya. If Hriday can be saved, it is only by the act of reading and writing.  This is a novel about love, ambition, and the fragility of both. As tender as fumbling youth and as hard as a calloused fist, Day Scholar is a clear-eyed, gritty and, ultimately, beautiful exposition of innocence under fire. It marks Siddharth Chowdhury as one of the most extraordinarily gifted writers of his generation. About the Author : - Siddharth Chowdhury is the author of Diksha at St. Martin's (2002) and Patna Roughcut (2005). He read English Literature at Delhi University (1993-98). In 2007, he held the Charles Wallace Writer-in-Residence fellowship at the University of Stirling in Scotland. Part of Day Scholar was written there. He lives in Delhi and works as Editorial Consultant with the house of Manohar.	2010	Pan Macmillan Ltd.						ZZZ000000
9780330519922	Room	Emma Donoghue		The story of a mother, her son, a locked room and the outside world. Jack is five and, like any little boy, excited at the prospect of presents and cake. He's looking forward to telling his friends it's his birthday, too. But although Jack is a normal child in many ways - loving, funny, bright, full of energy and questions - his upbringing is far from ordinary: Jack's entire life has been spent in a single room that measures just 12 feet by 12 feet; as far as he's concerned, Room is the entire world. He shares this world with his mother, with Plant, and tiny Mouse (though Ma isn't a fan and throws a book at Mouse when she sees him). There's TV too, of course - and the cartoon characters he thinks of as his friends - but Jack knows that nothing else he sees on the screen is real. Old Nick, on the other hand, is all too real, but only visits at night - like a bat - when Jack is meant to be asleep and hidden safely in Wardrobe. And only Old Nick has the code to Door, which is otherwise locked... Told in Jack's voice, ROOM is the story of a mother's love for her son, and of a young boy's innocence. Unsentimental yet affecting, devastating yet uplifting, it promises to be the most talked about novel of 2010.	2010	Pan Macmillan						ZZZ000000
