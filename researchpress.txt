9781905940820	Lives, Loves and Deaths of Splendidly Unreasonable Inventors	Jeremy Coller&Christine Chamberlain		Reaching Beyond the Moon is a brilliant analysis of 20 inventors who changed the world. Coller argues that there are basic personality types - Principal, Broker and Consultant - typified by certain traits that dictate the potential for success in the arena of invention. Few people have the full package and failure results when an individual who excels in one area of competence attempts to become all things. Coller focuses on the person rather the invention and the way in which he or she did or did not succeed in bringing that vision to fruition. On one level Reaching Beyond the Moon is a collection of fascinating stories; on another level these stories provoke an unconventional look at the inventive process that created such life-changing products as: the telephone; the sewing machine; dynamite; the cinema; the safety razor; and vulcanized rubber, for tyres. Only historical figures are included, allowing the authors to examine the complete arc of success or failure. Each of the stories, all of which are personal, colourful and packed with quirky nuggets of information, illustrates a particular aspect of the inventive personality.	2009-02-27	Infinite Ideas Limited						ZZZ000000

9781857883930	The Cult of the Amateur,How Today's Internet Is Killing Our Culture and Assaulting Our Economy	Andrew Keen		Silicon Valley insider and pundit Andrew Keen claims that today's new participatory Web 2.0 threatens our values, economy, and ultimately the very innovation and creativity that forms the fabric of American achievement. In today's self-broadcasting culture, where amateurism is celebrated and anyone with an opinion, however ill-informed, can publish a blog, post a video on YouTube, or change an entry on Wikipedia, the distinction between trained expert and uninformed amateur becomes blurred. When bloggers and videographers, unconstrained by professional standards or editorial filters, can manipulate public opinion, truth becomes a commodity to be bought, sold, packaged, and reinvented. The anonymity that Web 2.0 offers calls into question the reliability of the information we receive and creates an environment in which sexual predators and identity thieves can roam free. Keen urges us to consider the consequences of supporting a culture that endorses plagiarism and piracy and weakens traditional media and creative institutions.--From publisher description.	2007	Nicholas Brealey						ZZZ000000

9780717131631	A theory of everything,an integral vision for business, politics, science, and spirituality	Ken Wilber		Ken Wilber has long been hailed as one of the most important thinkers of our time but - until now - his work has seemed difficult for the general reader who lacks a background in consciousness studies or evolutionary theory. 'A Theory of Everything' is a concise, comprehensive overview of Wilber's revolutionary thought and its application in today's world. Here at last is a book that will allow a general audience fully to understand what all the excitement has been about. In clear, non-technical language, Wilber presents complex, cutting-edge theories and models that integrate the realms of body, mind, soul and spirit. He then demonstrates how these theories and models can be applied to real world problems in fields such as politics, medicine, business, education and the environment. Finally, he discusses daily practices that readers can take up in order to apply this integrative vision to their own, everyday lives. 'A Theory of Everything' is a compelling blueprint for the application of Wilber's ground-breaking theory in daily, practical situations.

9780413477606	Creating a role	Konstantin Stanislavsky		No-one has had greater influence on acting as we know it than Stanislavski. His 'system' or interpretations of it - has become the central force determining almost every performance we see on stage or screen. His teaching is principally set out in three famous books: An Actor Prepares, Building a Character and Creating a Role. It is still the only comprehensive theory of acting we possess. In the first book, An Actor Prepares, Stanislavski dealt with the inner imaginative processes. In the second Building a Character, he concentrated on the body, the voice and other physical means of expression. In Creating a Role, the third book, he describes the elaborate preparation that precedes actual performance.Creating a Role "describes the elaborate marination that precedes the acutal performance. The analyses of Othello and The Inspector General, which make up Parts Two and Three, show a mind cutting through text like an inspired psneumatic-drill...;Altogether Creating a Role is a brilliant little treatise and a careful reading is worth several lessons in almost any English acting academy" (Charles Marowitz, The Observer)	1981	Eyre Methuen						ZZZ000000

9781847960078	The art of classic rock	Paul Grushkin&Rob Roth		For forty years Rob Roth has collected rare examples of rock tour posters, advertising posters, rock memorabilia, original artwork and items of merchandise. His spectacular collection is so vast that it has never all been put on public display but when visitors to his spacious New York loft apartment - visitors like Elton John and Alice Cooper - caught a glimpse of some of the material Rob has collected over the years, they were amazed and urged him to let rock fans see the dazzling array of artefacts from the 70s and 80s. For many, the images lovingly catalogued in the pages of this book will evoke nostalgic memories of the blazing lights, drifting smoke and all-pervading audio power of the rock concerts of their youth. It is also, however, a lavishly produced presentation of some of the most vivid and exciting artwork from the rock world featuring bands such as The Rolling Stones, Queen, Pink Floyd, The Who, Led Zeppelin and every other major rock act of the era. Each section of the book features a particular band covering different tours and different albums to show how design and graphic styles changed and to provide an overview of rock history from the period. An introduction to the section puts the images in context, outlining the stage the bands and acts had reached in their development and discussing the art and artists. Each piece that is portrayed carries a caption describing exactly what it is, while items with a particular story to tell are accompanied by longer, more detailed texts.	2009-09-03	Goodman						ZZZ000000

9781906347093	Guitar	Ray Bonds		Although stringed instruments like the guitar?the cithera, lute, mandolin etc?have been popular for thousands of years, we tend to think of the guitar as a 20th century invention because the electric guitar was patented by George Beauchamp in 1936. Beauchamp was an inventor of musical instruments?his patents include the single-cone dobro guitar, the electric lap steel guitar (nicknamed the frying pan), the electric guitar (called the electro Spanish guitar, which was a hollow-body electric guitar), and the electric violin?and he co-founded Rickenbacher, a legendary name in guitar history. Founded by Adolph Rickenbacher and George Beauchamp in 1931 to sell electric Hawaiian guitars, the brand name later changed to Rickenbacker. The explosion of Rock?n?roll meant that the guitar became the must have instrument for many aspiring musicians. Easily portable, it was used in both acoustic and electric form and its sound quickly took over from the piano as the sound of popular music. After an introduction covering the history of the guitar, the different types of guitar, pickups and accessories, Guitar uses its superlarge format to look closely at the main types of guitar: from the early Rickenbackers, Fenders and Voxs through to those created by more modern manufacturers. Large-format images are allied to information boxes covering guitar specifications; manufacturing companies; and famous guitarists?many with photographs in concert.	2008-08-01	Compendium						ZZZ000000

9780233002699	Jumbo,This Being the True Story of the Greatest Elephant in the World	Paul Chambers		A magical blend of true story and popular science, Jumbo is the wonderful, colourful biography of the greatest elephant ever known. Born in Africa in 1863, Jumbo was orphaned by ivory-hunters, "rescued" and taken to France. Mistaken for a runt, he was sold to London Zoo, where he became the favourite of the British populace, from Queen Victoria to the young Winston Churchill - until, talent-spotted by the American circus-owner P.T. Barnum, and despite public outcry and Royal protestations, he was taken across the Atlantic to New York. There, having once more conquered public hearts and now a beast of giant proportions, he "befriended" a smaller elephant, Tom Thumb - in saving whose life he was to meet a tragic end. This book not only unravels the story, but also looks at Jumbo from a zoologist's point of view. Why was he thought to be a runt? What helped or hindered him in adapting to unfamiliar surroundings from one hemisphere to the other? How was he likely to have reacted to the overwhelming public attention - and to isolation from his natural habitat? The author draws illuminatingly on modern knowledge of elephant behaviour and biology to shed light on the mysteries surrounding Jumbo's life.	2009-05-14	Andre Deutsch						ZZZ000000

9781847322852	Flight: A Photographic History Of Aviation	T.A. Heppenheimer		Over a hundred years ago, on a windswept beach, Wilbur and Orville Wright took to the air - and, all too quickly, came down. Very soon, though, better concepts spread their wings: aircraft transformed warfare; they offered safe, speedy travel to distant places; the most advanced versions even touched the edge of space. The story of aviation provides tales of dreamers and visionaries: Juan Trippe conquered the world's oceans with Pan American World Airways; Hermann Goering built his Luftwaffe; US General Curtis leMay turned air power into a war-winning weapon and William Allen of Boeing defeated his rival Donald Douglas as they vied for leadership in the postwar skies. Vivid moments have marked a century of aviation: Louis Bleriot making the first aerial crossing of the English Channel; Charles Lindbergh, alone in his cockpit, slapping his face to stay awake. Edward Musick of Pan Am, flying with a heavy fuel-load, barely clearing a major bridge near San Francisco. Test pilot Chuck Yeager falling 10 miles in his out-of-control rocket plane, but achieving a safe landing. In Flight Informative text with stunning images from the National Air and Space Museum, the US National Archives and major manufacturers like Boeing Airbus and NASA, captures the drama, vividness and achievement of a century of flight.	2009-08-01	Carlton Books						ZZZ000000

An itinerary for a visitor with the great luxury of time would have to include a visit to Paris, Rheims Cathedral, Le Mont St Michel, the great chateaux of the Loire, the Atlantic port of Bordeaux, the ancient city of Carcassone, the city of Lyons, the skiing resort of Chamonix and the glamour of the French Riviera with its enchanting hilltop villages.	2008-09-04	Compendium						ZZZ000000
