9788190568241	Songs of the Survivors	:e:Yvonne Vaz-Ezdani	Paperback	Published in November 2007 by Frederick Noronha on behalf of Goa,1556, (http://goa1556.goa-india.org), Stories of World War II continue to absorb the interest of the readers, and there are many books on the subject. In 1942, Goa was a neutral Portuguese colony in western India, and largely unaffected by the war. But there were many Goans living in Burma when the first surprise bombings of Rangoon by Japanese planes took place. This book tells the story of Goans in the Burma of those days. It is a collection of stories based on the horrors of the Japanese invasion in Burma between 1942 and 1945, and the subsequent exodus of thousands of refugees who fled to India.	2007	Goa, 1556	282	English				ZZZ000000
9788190568203	In Black And White	:e:Frederick Noronha	Paperback	You can't be neutral about the media. Some are critical of it, some distrust it, but almost all of us are influenced by it. So why do newspapers in Goa behave the way they do? Can we get some clues from what insiders say about their experiences? This book covers over four decades of post-colonial Goa's newspaper scene. It offers colourful - if highly personalised, and often critical - stories of those who saw the media from the frontline. Read about the media and first assembly elections of 1963, and attempts in the 1970s to build alternatives in the English-language and Konkani. Many pages focus on the impact of the Herald (formerly O Heraldo) on journalism in contemporary Goa. In 1983, this paper switched from being the last Portuguese daily published in Asia, to an English-language newspaper printed using the latest in computers and technology. But not without challenges of its own.... Journalists explain their travails of covering rural Goa. Included is the story of the birth of the Gomantak Times. Outstation journos have their own insights on the media scene here. Two essays cover Konkani journalism, making some bold and contentious points. Among others, one essay also looks at the implications of the entry of the Times of India into Goa in 2008. Don't miss this commentary on the media in Goa if you don't miss your morning newspaper each day.	2008	Co-published byGoa, 1556Broadway Book		English				ZZZ000000

How can architecture foster an engagement between people and public places? Spurred by questions like these, this book focuses on contemporary Indian cultural institutions, or artplaces, as a special kind of public place. Offering a critique of contemporary architectural and institutional approaches to 'place-making', this volume proposes an alternative approach to thinking about architecture centred on our experience of inhabiting spaces. Such a habitational approach is crucial if architecture (and, by extension, urban design)   is to help nurture a larger engagement between people and their social environment.Himanshu Burte (b.1967) is an architect and writer based in Goa. He has written extensively on architecture and urban issues. His current research interests include contemporary Indian architecture and public space, sustainable technology, and the design of theatre spaces.
