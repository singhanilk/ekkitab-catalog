9780007241705	The Lighthouse Stevensons	Bella Bathurst		For centuries the seas around Scotland were notorious for shipwrecks. Mariners' only aids were skill, luck, and single coal-fire light on the east coast, which was usually extinguished by rain. In 1786 the Northern Lighthouse Trust was established, with Robert Stevenson appointed as chief engineer a few years later. In this engrossing book, Bella Bathhurst reveals that the Stevensons not only supervised the construction of the lighthouses under often desperate conditions but also perfected a design of precisely chiseled interlocking granite blocks that would withstand the enormous waves that batter these stone pillars. The same Stevensons also developed the lamps and lenses of the lights themselves, which "sent a gleam across the wave" and prevented countless ships from being lost at sea.While it is the writing of Robert Louis Stevenson that brought fame to the family name, this memorizing account shows how his extraordinary ancestors changed the shape of the Scotland coast-against incredible odds and with remarkable technical ingenuity.	2007-05-01	Harper Perennial		English				ZZZ000000
9780007241668	The Diving-Bell and the Butterfly	Jean-Dominique Bauby		The diary of Jean-Dominique Bauby who, with his left eyelid (the only surviving muscle after a massive stroke) dictated a remarkable book about his experiences locked inside his body. A masterpiece and a bestseller in France. On 8 December 1995, Jean-Dominique Bauby suffered a massive stroke and slipped into a coma. When he regained consciousness three weeks later, the only muscle left functioning was in his left eyelid although his mind remained as active and alert as it had ever been. He spent most of 1996 writing this book, letter by letter, blinking as an alphabet was repeatedly read out to him. 'The Diving-Bell and the Butterfly' was published in France on Thursday 6th March 1997. It was immediately hailed as a masterpiece. And then, three days later, he died. 'The Diving-Bell and the Butterfly', which records Bauby's lonely existence, is probably the most remarkable book about the triumph of the human spirit, the ability to invent a life for oneself in the most appalling of circumstances, that you will ever read	2007-03-01	Harper Collins		English				ZZZ000000

9780007195732	Earthly Powers,The Conflict Between Religion and Politics from the French Revolution to the Great War	Michael Burleigh		A major work setting out the inextricable link between politics and religion over the past two centuries, from the French Revolution to the present day's War on Terror. In this dazzling and hugely relevant book Michael Burleigh explores the way in which religion, broadly construed, functions within European societies. 'Earthly Powers' is an examination of the politics of religion and the religion of politics in Europe from the French Revolution until the Great War. Its astonishing scope encompasses the philosophers of the Enlightenment and the influence of thinkers like de Maistre and de Bonald and Lamennais, as well as the pseudo-religious aspects of Marxism. It looks at painters like Zoffany and David and analyses their representations of their times. It considers the exploits of O'Connell, hero of Catholic Emancipation, Mazzini, Mickiewicz and Garibaldi, and goes via nineteenth century English and Russian literature, to the epic struggles between Church and State, industry and the rise of Christian socialism. It concludes with the advent of the 'old stone gods' that heralded the totalitarian political religions of the twentieth century. Throughout, Burleigh's writing is never less than brilliant and absorbing, handling a welter of ideas and historical detail with confidence, verve and sophistication. He is always revealing and original, showing us the deeper workings of history in a way we have never seen before. It confirms him as one of Europe's greatest modern historians.	2006-10-02	Harper Perennial		English				ZZZ000000

9788172238018	Strategic Intuition: The Creative Spark In Human Achievement	William Duggan		That's when you need it most. Everyone knows you need creative thinking, or entrepreneurial thinking, or innovative thinking, or strategic thinking to succeed in the modern world. All these kinds of thinking happen through flashes of insight - strategic intuition. And now that we know how it works, you can learn to do it better.That's what this book is about. Over the past ten years, William Duggan has conducted pioneering research on strategic intuition and for the past three years has taught a popular course at Columbia Business School on the subject. He now gives us this eye-opening book that shows how strategic intuition lies at the heart of great achievements throughout human history: the scientific and computer revolutions, women's suffrage, the civil rights movement, modern art, microfinance in poor countries, and more.Considering the achievements of people and organizations, from Bill Gates to Google, Copernicus to Martin Luther King, Picasso to Patton, you'll never think the same way about strategy again. Three kinds of strategic ideas apply to human achievement: Strategic analysis, where you study the situation you face; Strategic intuition, where you get a creative idea for what to do; and, Strategic planning, where you work out the details of how to do it. There is no shortage of books about strategic analysis and strategic planning. This new book by William Duggan is the first full treatment of strategic intuition. It's the missing piece of the strategy puzzle that makes essential reading for anyone interested in achieving more in any field of human endeavor.	2008	HarperCollins		English				ZZZ000000

'Women do different things when they're depressed. Some smoke, others drink, some call their therapists, some eat...And I do what I have always done - go off on a book bender that can last for days.' Whenever she's in crisis - her marriage ends, her career stalls, her fantasy man shows signs of human frailty - Dora (named after Eudora Welty) escapes into not one, not two, but a carefully selected stack of books, shutting the door on the outside world until she emerges from her book binge strong enough to face her problems. Books have always been her saving grace, sheltering her during a difficult childhood and arming her with lessons and epigrams that are right for nearly every situation. But life is more complicated than a-book-a-day, and people - like her ex-alcoholic mother and judgmental sister - aren't as compliant as beloved characters in a novel... Whether she's being seduced by a quotation-quipping Quixote, or explaining death to a child by reading from 'Charlotte's Web', Dora is Every-reader, and her charming story, shot through with humour and humanity, will delight anyone who's ever sought solace in the pages of a book.	2007-05-01	Harper Perennial		English				ZZZ000000

9780007206025	Liberty,The Lives and Times of Six Women in Revolutionary France	Lucy Moore		"At the heart of Paris's intellectual movement, Germaine de Stael was a figure like no other. Passionate, fiercely intelligent and as consumed by love affairs as she was by politics, she helped to write the 1791 Constitution at the salon in which she entertained the great thinkers of the age. At the other end of the social scale, her working-class counterparts patrolled the streets of Paris with pistols in their belts. Theroigne de Mericourt was an unhappy courtesan when she fell in love with revolutionary ideals. Denied a political role because of her sex, she nevertheless campaigned tirelessly until a mob beating left her broken in both mind and body. Later came the glittering merveilleuses, whose glamour, beauty, and propensity for revealing outfits propelled them to the top of post-revolutionary society. Exuberant, decadent Theresia Tallien reportedly helped engineer Robespierre's downfall - in so doing, she and her fellow 'sans-chemises' ushered in a new world that combined sexual license with the amorality of the new Republic." "Lucy Moore reanimates the lives of six women from these three very different segments of French society. Through their lives, loves and failures, the wider history of the Revolution receives a retelling that illuminates not only the brief, hopeful period in which liberty and equality seemed within reach, but also the ways in which they were betrayed."--BOOK JACKET.	2007	Harper Perennial		English				ZZZ000000

He discusses his experiences of working with the very best of movie talent, including Mel Brooks, Woody Allen, Sidney Poitier and Richard Pryor, and tells how he developed his own unique style from his early days at The Actors' Studio with Lee Strasberg.Amongst other incidents, he describes his time in the UK, which he has great fondness for, studying at the Old Vic Theatre School in Bristol. During this period he came top of his class at fencing and doorstepped Sir John Geilgud to ask him to explain the use of iambic pentametre.Wilder also talks amusingly about his failed love life off-screen (including 4 marriages) and is candid about much darker times such as the death of his third wife, comedienne Gilda Radner, from cancer. He also reveals his own recent battle with the disease, which he's now come through, and which changed his perspective on life.This isn't a traditional celebrity 'tell all' but an insight into the life and mind of a great comic actor who has a rare ability to write as well as he performs.	2006-06-05	HarperCollins Entertainment		English				ZZZ000000

9780007204076	The Embers of Heaven	Alma Alexander		Perfect for fans of Memoirs of a Geisha and Empress Orchid ndash; 'The Embers of Heaven' is a magical epic, with delightful characters, an intriguing scenario and a real feeling of place and history. It has a wonderful combination of character, romantic lives, and spiritual quest, set against a credible historical background. In 'The Secrets of Jin-Shei,' eight women pledge themselves as sisters in the name of jin-shei, the unbreakable bond, the promise that lasts a lifetime. This sisterhood shapes their lives, their country and their world. 'The Embers of Heaven' begins four hundred years later. In eighteenth-century Syai, and its capital city of Linh-an, things have changed beyond recognition. On the face of it, women are more equal than they have ever been. But the men run the machines, the factories, and the technology. Women have lost the ability to weave their fates and influence the course of events. The foundation of an empire once rested on jin-shei and its customs. It connected women from every walk of life and formed a bond that empowered every woman who swore the oath. The advancement of printing, the developments of technology and the changes in society seem to have improved the daily lives of the underclass, but women have been stripped of this sacred pact. Amais is heir to her poet-ancestress's manuscripts and journals. The journals are all in jin-ashu, the women's tongue, taught sketchily to Amais by her mother. Amais has the clear vision of an outsider looking in. Combined with her deep and instinctive bond to her ancestors and her culture, she determines to reinvent the Women's Country and bring the jin-shei back. But just as her crusade begins, she and her family are caught up in the whirlwind of the Golden Rising ndash; a people's revolution that is fated to destroy much that was once valuable, gracious and beautiful.	2006-09-04	Harper						ZZZ000000

9780007243617	The Yacoubian Building	Alaa Al Aswany		An international bestseller, 'The Yacoubian Building' is a mesmerising and controversial novel that is at once an impassioned celebration and a ruthless dissection of a society dominated by bribery and corruption. The Yacoubian building - once grand, but now dilapidated - stands on one of Cairo's main boulevards. Taha, the doorman's son, has aspirations beyond the slum in the skies, and dreams of one day becoming a policeman. He studies hard, and passes all the exams, but when he is rejected because his family is neither rich nor influential, the bitterness sets in. His girlfriend, Busyana, finds herself unable to earn a living without also providing sexual services for the men who hire her. When Taha seeks solace in a student Islamic organisation, the pressure mounts, and he is drawn to actions with devastating consequences. 'The Yacoubian Building' follows Taha's trajectory from innocence to tragedy. The people whose lives orbit his - the inhabitants of the building - are also facing their own difficult choices. From those living in squalid and cramped conditions on the rooftops, to the homosexual editor of Le Caire newspaper and a womanising aristocrat, all of the contradictions in Egyptian society are here. Religious feelings live side-by-side with promiscuity; bribery and exploitation alternate with moments of joy and elation; modernity clashes with the vision of a more ancient society. Alaa Al Aswany's mesmerising novel caused an unprecedented stir when it was published in Egypt. It is at once an impassioned celebration and a ruthless dissection of a society dominated by bribery and corruption.	2007	Fourth Estate						ZZZ000000

9780007258482	Little Britain,How a Small Country Built the Modern World	Harry Bingham		Celebratory, witty and incredibly insightful, Harry Bingham explores the eccentricities and customs of the British nation in a bid to answer a question which has everyone debating - Who are we?For the British, that's an oddly difficult question. Although our national self-assessment usually notes a number of good points (we're inventive, tolerant, and at least we're not French), it lists a torrent of bad ones too. Our society is fragmented and degenerate. Our kids are thugs, our workers ill-educated, our public services abysmal. We drink too much. Our house prices are crazy, our politicians sleazy, our roads jammed, our football team rubbish. When the 'Times' invited readers to suggest new designs for the backs of British coins, one reader wrote in saying, 'How about a couple of yobs dancing on a car bonnet or a trio of legless ladettes in the gutter?'Is there really nothing to be proud of? British inventors have been responsible for myriad marvels we now take for granted, from the steam engine to the world wide web. British medical and public health innovations - vaccination, integrated mains sewerage, antiseptic surgery - have saved far more lives than all other medical innovations put together. And why stop there? The British empire covered a quarter of the earth's surface but used an army smaller than that of Switzerland to exert its rule. The world speaks our language. Our scientists have won vast numbers of Nobel Prizes. The evolution of habeas corpus, trial by jury and the abolition of torture aren't purely British in inspiration, but owe more to us than to anyone else. Our parliamentary democracy has been hugely influential in spreading ideals of liberty and representative government round the world.If the modern world is richer, freer, more peaceful, more democratic and healthier than it was, then Britain has played a leading role in that transformation. This book is about just that. Taking a particular interest in the many things that we did first, or best, or most, or were the only ones ever to do, this focuses especially on those of our oddities that spread across the world - everything from football to the rule of law.	2007-10-11	Fourth Estate						ZZZ000000

9780007252213	Maynard & Jennica	Rudy Delson		A comic love-story, set in and around New York at the beginning of the 21st century. Maynard Gogarty is bored, with what he's not quite sure, but he's definitely bored. He's a tweed-suit-wearing, perennially glum thirty something living in a Manhattan flat secretly paid for by his crabby grandmother, and is nursing a short film career that shows no signs of development. Plus he's misanthropic and an unhappy dilettante - a real catch. But recently he's turned over a new leaf: he's decided, whatever befalls him, he's going to be happy. Enter Jennica Green, who seems to have it all: a Princeton graduate with a high-paying city job and her own apartment. But then again, she's the kind of girl who spends two weeks organising a trip to a county fair, which might explain why she is single and looks like remaining so. When Maynard glimpses this Jewish Bridget Jones on a blazingly hot subway ride, what are the odds...? Set either side of 9/11, Maynard and Jennica's courtship is narrated by our heroes and their many, many observers, among them all four parents (three living), a Russian-German-Israeli scam artist (and Maynard's current wife), a rapper with a linguistics background, a macaw, and an adolescent trumpeter. On the face of it, 'Maynard & Jennica' is about many things: a tree homicide, New York City's real estate boom, hip-hop sampling, the 1989 San Francisco earthquake, the Jewish intermarriage crisis, subway emergency brake etiquette, the tournament rules of scrabble, the naming of cats. At its heart though, this brilliant first novel with its menagerie of voices is a simple love story, as touching as it is hilarious.	2007-10-01	Fourth Estate						ZZZ000000

9780007216857	The year of magical thinking	Joan Didion		From one of America's iconic writers, a portrait of a marriage and a life ndash; in good times and bad ndash; that will speak to anyone who has ever loved a husband or wife or child. A stunning book of electric honesty and passion. Several days before Christmas 2003, John Gregory Dunne and Joan Didion saw their only daughter, Quintana, fall ill. At first they thought it was flu, then pneumonia, then complete sceptic shock. She was put into an induced coma and placed on life support. Days later ndash; the night before New Year's Eve ndash;the Dunnes were just sitting down to dinner after visiting the hospital when John suffered a massive and fatal coronary. In a second, this close, symbiotic partnership of 40 years was over. Four weeks later, their daughter pulled through. Two months after that, arriving at LA airport, she collapsed and underwent six hours of brain surgery at UCLA Medical Centre to relieve a massive hematoma. This powerful book is Didion's 'attempt to make sense of the weeks and then months that cut loose any fixed idea I ever had about death, about illness ... about marriage and children and memory ... about the shallowness of sanity, about life itself'. The result is an exploration of an intensely personal yet universal experience: a portrait of a marriage, and a life, in good times and bad.	2006	Harper Perennial						ZZZ000000

9780007191321	The Winter Rose	Jennifer Donnelly		Another strong, satisfying novel, full of rich storytelling, by the author of the favourite 'The Tea Rose'. Set in London and Africa in the early days of the twentieth century, 'The Winter Rose' introduces some remarkable new characters. India Selwyn-Jones is one of the rare new breed: a lady doctor. Her family, her eligible, ambitious fiance, the male medical establishment all object but she insists on defying convention and finds a post in London's East End. There she meets a gangland boss called Sid Malone. Criminal he may be but he also has a hidden charm, and a devastatingly attractive personality, and when India is called to treat him after a dockside brawl, their friendship becomes more intense. But Sid Malone is not his real name: and he has a past and enemies by the score, including India's determined and ruthless fiance whose intention is to marry into the family money as well as becoming a leading political figure. The stormy, noisy, brawling docklands are a natural home to the political fight as the fledgling Labour Party gets underway, and the struggle for the women's vote becomes more strident. But the East End is also a place for those who have a past to hide, a new beginning to find. And so the complicated strands of betrayal and pretence, of ambition and family, are woven again into a new drama, in a new country. Jennifer Donnelly, author of 'A Gathering Light' as well as 'The Tea Rose', has a wonderful gift for sweeping storytelling, with a lively cast of vivid characters, rich and detailed backgrounds. Her writing has a warmth and energy that takes all readers completely into her world.	2006	HarperCollins						ZZZ000000

9780007232093	The painted drum	Louise Erdrich		From one of the most gifted bestselling American novelists comes this elegantly crafted novel that explores the strange power that lost children exert on the memories of those they leave behind. When Faye Travers is sent to appraise a family estate in a small New Hampshire town and comes across a forgotten set of valuable Native American artefacts, she is not surprised by the discovery. It is well known that the family descends from Indian ancestors, one of whom used to work on the North Dakota Ojibwe reservation that is home to her mother's family. However, she is shocked when she finds within the collection a rare drum - an impressive, ornate yet delicate creation made out of a hollowed cedar and stretched moose skin - particularly because without even touching the instrument she hears its deep resonant sound. Following the discovery, we trace the drum's passage both backwards and forwards in time, from the reservation on the northern plains to New Hampshire and back. We hear the voice of Bernard Shaawano, an Ojibwe, who tells of how his grandfather created the drum after years of mourning his younger daughter's death and how it changes the paths of those who cross it. Through Faye, we experience her anguished relationship with a local sculptor who also mourns the loss of a daughter, and witness the life Faye has made alone with her mother, in the shadow of her sister's death. Erdich poetically captures the intricate, transformative rhythms of human grief that these losses create within her characters with grace, wit, captivating prose and surprising beauty.	2006	Harper Perennial						FIC025000

Its unsavory origins _ which lie in white greed _ contain the seeds of its demise. Here, everybody is connected _ by love or friendship, by blood, and, most importantly, by the burden of a shared history.Evelina Harp, a witty, ambitious young girl, part Ojibwe, part white, is growing up on the reservation. She is prone to falling hopelessly in love, most notably with her cousin, Corwin Peace, a misfit with a late-discovered talent for music, and then with her teacher, Sister Maria Anita Buckendorf, a godzilla-like nun whose frank acceptance of herself is irresistible. Mooshum, Evelina's grandfather, is a seductive storyteller, a repository of family and tribal history; listening enraptured to his tales Evelina learns of a horrific crime that has marked both Ojibwe and whites, whose fates have been inextricably bound ever since. Nobody understands the weight of that crime better than Judge Antone Bazil Coutts, a half breed from Pluto, who also suffers from pains in the love department; as a judge on the reservation, he keeps watch over its inhabitants and recounts their lives with compassion and rare insight.In distinct and winning voices, Evelina and Judge Coutts unravel the intertwining stories of their families, their friends, and their lovers, the descendents of both the perpetrators and victims of the historic crime.Louise Erdrich's characteristically graceful prose and sense of the comic and the tragic sweep readers along to the surprising conclusion of this stunning novel, a portrait of the complex allegiances, passions, and drama of a haunting land and its all-too-human people.	2008-07	Harper Perennial						ZZZ000000

9780007181285	Adverbs	Daniel Handler		A dramatic meditation on love both fleeting and everlasting, 'Adverbs' is a serious work of fiction by one of today's most innovative voices, and famed author of the 'Lemony Snicket' series. 'Adverbs' marks the return of Daniel Handler to adult fiction as he tackles life's most complicated and compelling noun: love. In a series of intersecting narratives that explore variations of that ineffable feeling, Handler crafts a moving and shifting story exploring the frustrating glory of this most troublesome of emotions. Two friends, one dying and one lonely; an adolescent's first homosexual stirrings for his sister's boyfriend; a doomed, enormously inappropriate tryst between a taxi driver and his passenger; a high-school crush that falls painfully short of a movie projected on a grungy screen. Handler's characters experience love in all of its dark, triumphant, devastating and sneaky forms.

9780007234202	Ida B	Katherine Hannigan		Poignant tale of a 9-year-old girl's emotional journey after her idyllic life is shattered by her mother's illness. Ida B's life is perfect: she is home-schooled by loving parents on a beautiful farm with its own orchard, creek and mountain (well, a pile of earth too tall to be called a hill). Left to her own devices in this rural haven, she talks to the trees in the orchard and sends miniature rafts down the creek, to which she attaches notes like "What is life like in Canada? Please respond". But the idyll is shattered when Ida B's mother develops cancer. Her father is forced to stop home-schooling her - and to sell the orchard to a property developer. Feeling angry and betrayed, Ida B rebels in every way she can think of - until a young teacher at her new school shows her how to open her heart to others...	2007-04-02	HarperCollins Childrens						ZZZ000000

9780007219827	Nemesis,The Battle for Japan, 1944-45	Max Hastings		"In 1944-45, the war against Japan embraced the most remarkable cast of statesmen and commanders the world has ever seen: Churchill, Roosevelt, and Stalin; Nimitz, MacArthur, Mountbatten, Slim, LeMay; Chiang Kai-shek and Mao Zedong. The drama which ended in Japan's utter defeat was acted out across the vast stage of Asia. Battles by land, sea and air extended over millions of square miles: Imphal and Kohima, Leyte Gulf and Iwo Jima, Okinawa and the B-29 fire-bombing offensive against Japan's cities, the great Soviet assault on Manchuria." "Max Hastings has written Nemesis as a counterpart to Armageddon, his bestselling saga of the 1944-45 struggle for Germany. Once again, he matches the story of command decisions, rivalries and follies with the experiences of British, American, Russian, Chinese and Japanese soldiers, sailors and airmen, fighting some of the bloodiest campaigns of the war amid heat, disease, privation and against a merciless enemy. He has interviewed extensively in Asia to tell the story of China's war, which cost at least fifteen million lives yet is almost unknown in the West. Modern China's bitterness towards Japan is rooted in the horrors which Hirohito's armies inflicted upon the Chinese people between 1931 and 1945." "With the aid of scores of eyewitness accounts, Hastings portrays the Russian onslaught of August 1945, in which Stalin launched 1.5 million men against the Japanese, to gain the territorial booty promised to him at Yalta. The book describes Slim's brilliant 1945 campaign in Burma, which Churchill never wanted to fight. The British and Indian armies achieved a sunset Victory for the Empire - but one their commanders knew could contribute nothing to Japan's defeat." "Here are word-portraits of the ordeals of American sailors in the great a battles which destroyed the Japanese Imperial Navy, alongside tales of communist Chinese guerrillas, Japanese fighter pilots, British soldiers sweating in the jungles of Burma, Tokyo families facing incineration by firestorm. Nemesis weaves together the complex strands of an epic which stretched across a continent and many nations, in three dimensions, embracing some of the most terrible human experiences of twentieth century."--BOOK JACKET.	2007-10-11	HarperPress						ZZZ000000

9780007218653	Just another kid	Torey L. Hayden		A dramatic and remarkable narrative of an extraordinary teacher's determination, from the author of the Sunday Times bestsellers 'Tiger's Child' and 'One Child'.Torey Hayden faced six emotionally troubled kids no other teacher could handle - three recent arrivals from battle-torn Northern Ireland, badly traumatised by the horrors of war; an eleven-year-old boy, who knew life inside an institution; an excitable girl, aggressive and sexually precocious at the age of eight; and seven-year-old Leslie, perhaps the most hopeless of all, unresponsive and unable to speak. But Torey's most daunting challenge turns out to be Leslie's mother, a stunning young doctor who soon discovers that she needs Torey's love and help just as much as the children.'Just Another Kid' is a beautiful illustration of nurturing concern, not only for a few emotionally disturbed children, but for one woman facing a personal battle.	2006-06-05	HarperElement						ZZZ000000
9780007213726	Thomas Jefferson,Author of America	Christopher Hitchens		Leading journalist and social critic Christopher Hitchens offers a startlingly new and provocative interpretation of America's founding father, situating Jefferson within the context of America's evolution and tracing his legacy over the past two hundred years. Whether in politics, literature, science, or the arts, the subjects of this dynamic series of brief biographies have shaped our picture of the world. The authors' strong sensibilities and sharp, lively points of view make us see that picture in a totally new way. The key to the 'Eminent Lives' series is the pairing of author and subject: distinguished writers on figures central to world culture. An eloquent writer, Thomas Jefferson was an awkward public speaker and a reluctant candidate; nevertheless he left an indelible presidential legacy. He penned the Declaration of Independence and acted as Minister to France yet yearned for a quieter career in the Virginia legislature. Predicting that slavery would shape the future of America's development, this professed proponent of emancipation elided the issue in the Declaration and continued to own human property. In the background of this sophisticated analysis is a large historical drama: the fledgling nation's struggle for independence, formed in the crucible of the eighteenth-century Enlightenment, and, in its shadow, the deformation of that struggle in the excesses of the French Revolution. This artful portrait of a formative figure and a turbulent era poses a challenge to anyone interested in world history and the ambiguities of human nature.	2007-03-05	HarperCollins						BIO011000
9780007156382	God's Secret Agents,Queen Elizabeth's Forbidden Priests and the Hatching of the Gunpowder Plot	Alice Hogge		A thrilling account of treachery, loyalty and martyrdom in Elizabethan England from an exceptional new writer.As darkness fell on the evening of Friday, 28 October 1588, just weeks after the defeat of the Spanish Armada, two young Englishmen landed in secret on a Norfolk beach. They were Jesuit priests. Their aim was to achieve by force of argument what the Armada had failed to do by force of arms: return England to the Catholic Church.Eighteen years later their mission had been shattered by the actions of a small group of terrorists, the Gunpowder Plotters; they themselves had been accused of designing 'that most horrid and hellish conspiracy'; and the future of every Catholic they had come to save depended on the silence of an Oxford joiner, builder of priest-holes, being tortured in the Tower of London.'God's Secret Agents' tells the story of Elizabeth's 'other' England, a country at war with an unseen enemy, a country peopled - according to popular pamphlets and Government proclamations - with potential traitors, fifth-columnists, and assassins. And it tells this story from the perspective of that unseen 'enemy', England's Catholics, a beleaguered, alienated minority, struggling to uphold its faith.Ultimately 'God's Secret Agents' is the story of men who would die for their cause undone by men who would kill for it.	2006	Harper Perennial						ZZZ000000
9780007137541	Sahib,The British Soldier in India 1750-1914	Richard Holmes		'Sahib' is a broad and sweeping military history of the British soldier in India, but its focus, like that of Tommy and Redcoat before it, will be on the men who served in India and the women who followed them across that vast and dusty continent, bore their children, and, all too often, mopped their brows as they died. The book begins with the remarkable story of India's rise from commercial enclave to great Empire, from Clive's victory of Plassey, through the imperial wars of the 18th-century and the Afghan and Sikh Wars of the 1840s, through the bloody turmoil of the Mutiny, and the frontier campaigns at the century's end. With its focus on the experience of ordinary soldiers, 'Sahib' explains to us why soldiers of the Raj had joined the army, how they got to India and what they made of it when they arrived. The book examines Indian soldiering in peace and war, from Kipling's 'snoring barrack room' to storming parties assaulting mighty fortresses, cavalry swirling across open plains, and khaki columns inching their way between louring hills. Making full use of extensive and often neglected archive material in the India Office Library and National Army Museum, 'Sahib' will do for the British soldier in India - whether serving a local ruler, forming part of the Indian army, or soldiering with a British regiment - what 'Tommy' has done for the ordinary soldier in World War I.-- publisher.	2006	Harper Perennial						ZZZ000000

In Victorian England What Did Every Middle-Class Housewife Need To Create The Perfect Home? 'The Book Of Household Management'. 'Oh, But Of Course!' Mrs Beeton Would No Doubt Declare With Brisk Authority. But Mrs Beeton Is Not Quite The Matronly Figure That Has Kept Her Name Resonating 150 Years After The Publication Of 'The Book Of Household Management'. The Famous Pages Of Carefully Costed Recipes, Warnings About Not Gossiping To Visitors, And Making Sure You Always Keep Your Hat On In Someone Else'S House Were Indispensable In The Moulding Of The Victorian Domestic Bliss. But There Are Many Myths Surrounding The Legend Of Mrs Beeton. It Is Very Possible That Her Book Was Given So Much Social Standing Through Fear As She Was Believed To Be A Bit Of An Old Dragon. It Seems Though That Mrs Beeton Was A Series Of Contradictions. Kathryn Hughes Reveals Here That Bella Beeton Was A Million Miles Away From The Stoical, Middle-Aged Matron. She Was In Fact Only 25 Years Old When She Created The Guide To Successful Family Living And Had Only Had Five Years Experience Of Her Own To Inform Her. She Lived In A Semi-Detached House In Pinner With The Bare Minimum Of Servants. She Bordered On Being A Workaholic, And Certainly Wasn'T The Meek And Mild Little Wife That Her Book Was Aimed At More A Highly Intelligent And Ambitious Young Woman. After Preaching About Wholesome And Clean Living, Bella Beeton Died At The Age Of 28 From (Contrary To Her Parent'S Belief) Bad Hygiene. Kathryn Hughes Sympathetically Explores The Irony Behind Bella Beeton'S Public And Private Image In This Highly Readable And Informative Study Of Victorian Lifestyle.	2006-07-27	Harper Perennial						ZZZ000000

9780007192588	The awful end of prince William the silent,the first assassination of a head of State with a handgun	Lisa Jardine		A brilliantly detailed and gripping account of the assassination in 1584 of Prince William of Orange, and the shockwaves it sent through an age.The illustrious Making History Series, edited by Lisa Jardine and Amanda Foreman, explores an eclectic mix of history's tipping points. In 'The Awful End of Prince William the Silent', series editor Lisa Jardine explores the historical ramifications of just such a instance, the first assassination of a head of state with a hand-held gun. The shooting of Prince William of Orange in the hallway of his Delft residence in July 1584 by a French Catholic - the second attempt on his life - had immediate political consequences: it was a serious setback for the Protestant cause in the Netherlands, as its forces fought for independence from the Catholic rule of the Hapsburg empire. But, as Jardine brilliantly illustrates, its implications for those in positions of power were even more far-reaching, as the assassination heralded the arrival of a lethal new threat to the security of nations - a pistol that could be concealed and used to deadly effect at point-blank range.Queen Elizabeth I, William's close Protestant ally, was devastated by his death and thrown into panic; in the aftermath of William's death, legislation was enacted in the English parliament making it an offence to bring a pistol anywhere near a royal palace. Elizabeth's terror was not misplaced - as Jardine observes, this assassination was the first in a long and bloody line including those of Abraham Lincoln in 1865 and Archduke Ferdinand in 1914 and is all too relevant today.	2006	Harper Perennial						ZZZ000000

Jones, the bestselling and prize-winning author of 'The Known World', returns to the form that first inspired him - the short story In this collection, Jones returns to the city that inspired his first book, 'Lost in the City'.

9780007230686	What does China think?	Mark Leonard		An invigorating book about the debates raging within China. We all know about the fast pace of change in this country. This book brings us the ideas being fought over in the country itself a?? from democracy to the idea of a a??peaceful risea??. It challenges all of our assumptions about China. We know everything and nothing about China. We know that China is changing so fast that the maps in Shanghai need to be rewritten every two weeks. We know that China has brought 300 million people from agricultural backwardness into modernity in just 30 years (something that took 200 years in Europe). Chinaa??s voracious appetite for resources is gobbling up 40% of the worlda??s cement., 40% of its coal, 30% of its steel, and 12% of its energy. It has become so integrated into the global economy that its prospects have immediate effects on our everyday lives: simultaneously doubling the cost of the London Olympics while halving the cost of our computers; keeping the US economy afloat but sinking the Italian footwear industry. We have an image of China as a dictatorship; a nationalist empire that threatens its neighbours and global peace. But how many people know about the debates raging within China? What do we really know about the kind of society China wants to become? What ideas are motivating its citizens? We can name Americaa??s Neo-Cons and the religious right, but cannot name Chinese writers, thinkers or journalists a?? what is the future they dream of for their country, or the world it is shaping? Because Chinaa??s rise a?? like the fall of Rome or the British Raj a?? will echo down generations to come, these are the questions we increasingly need to ask. Mark Leonard asks us to forget everything we thought we knew about China and start again. He introduces us to the thinkers that are shaping Chinaa??s wide open future and opens up a hidden world of intellectual debate that is driving a new Chinese revolution and changing the face of the world.	2008	Fourth Estate						ZZZ000000

Around them are ranged their schoolfriends and girlfriends and ex-friends and new friends fresh off the street. The feast begins. Everything is being changed and being challenged. And here in this kitchen, the nutritious tolerance can be sniffed. Over there in the corner is Frances' ex-husband, Comrade Johnny, who delivers his rousing tirades, then laps up the adolescent adulation while he laps up his soup, before disappearing into the night to evade the clutches of his responsibilities. Upstairs sits Johnny's exiled mother, funding all, but finding she can embrace only one lost little girl. And will the Africans tolerate? These are the people dreaming the Sixties into being and the people who on the morning after all that dreaming, woke to find they were the ones taxed with clearing up and making good.	2002-07-01	Flamingo						ZZZ000000

"Bringing together the celebrated stories, Particularly Cats and Rufus the Survivor, and the memoir, The Old Age of El Magnifico, this book brilliantly evokes the subtleties of feline existence and convinces us of the reasons why cats really matter."--BOOK JACKET.	2008-10-20	HarperCollins Publishers Limited						ZZZ000000

9780007232802	Sunbathing in the rain,a cheerful book about depression	Gwyneth Lewis		101 Ways to Climb out of the Slough of Despondency a literary guide (part memoir, part companion) to coming through depression. 'Depression is internal snow. Black snow. The flakes whirl around like motes in the water around your personal shipwreck. The quicker you dive down to see your sorry state, the better for you in life. For above you, if only you can reach it without getting the bends, are sunshine, laughter on a yacht, the clink of plates as a lunch of steaming fish is handed round.' Whilst the overall structure of 'Sunbathing in the Rain' moves from dark to light, telling the story of Lewis's recovery, its different strands allow a variety of tones and subjects to be explored, from the profound to the frivolous. Alongside a paragraph about the proper relationship between the ego, the mind and the emotions nestles a passage on the therapeutic value of nail varnish. Practical hints on how to get better (diet, read Hello!, helpful pieces of music) are alongside striking quotations, ranging from sentences on crisp packets, to prayers, from Russian orthodox writings on silence to collections of slang. Part memoir drawing on her own experiences, both adverse and encouraging, as a depressive and an alcoholic and part guide or companion, this book brings Burton's 'Anatomy of Melancholy' into the twenty-first century. For it will have two voices, one calling from the valley of despair, the other from a safer, calmer new place. The suffering depressive needs help from outside his or her own consciousness, a radical new perspective that makes life possible again. This unique book offers it.	2006-10-26	Harper Perennial						ZZZ000000
9780007242009	Magic for Beginners	Kelly Link		in this dazzling collection, prize-winning short story writer Kelly Link takes the ordinary and makes it strange - and the strange and makes it ordinary. Engaging, funny, eerie and magical, these nine stories prove Link to be an original and important talent. Of all the books you read this year, this will be the one that you remember. Taking themes from horror and fantasy, these stories transform them into the stuff of delicate lyrical fantasy, with a distinctive and effervescent blend of humour and pathos. in 'Stone Animals', a middle-class family moves from Manhattan to a beautiful house in the suburbs. Almost immediately, their belongings become haunted, and they are increasingly unnerved by the growing hordes of rabbits that camp out nightly on the front lawn. The title story follows a group of adolescent schoolfriends whose experiences subtly parallel events in a surreal TV fantasy series which switches channels and times at whim. in 'The Hortlak', an all-night convenience store serves zombies as an experiment in retail; while 'The Faery Handbag' features a village which takes refuge from time to time in a magical handbag. Bold, tender, mischievous and unsettling, Link's stories have the inisistent quality of dreams and show a writer at the height of her powers.	2007-02-05	Harper Perennial						ZZZ000000
9780007360932	Power Trip	Amanda Little		From Oil Wells to Solar Cells--Our Ride to the Renewable Future In this fresh and gutsy analysis, Amanda Little lays bare America's energy past, present and future and shows how the innovatory designs that got it to its current energy crisis will actually save it from ruin. 'We're about to see a revolution in the way we live, fundamental changes to the way our homes work, the way our cars move, the way we grow our food, distribute our products, the way we make and recycle plastics.' - Amanda Little In this adventurous, jargon free, optimistic book, Amanda Little - tipped as 'the new voice of green' by Robert Redford - reveals the gargantuan influence of oil on our daily lives. It fights our wars, grows our crops, produces our plastics and medicines, warms our homes and animates our cities. We've allowed it to seep into every facet of our existence, from the shine on glossy magazine covers to life-saving pharmaceuticals. We depend on it completely. So what does this mean for when the oil runs out? From a deep-sea oil rig to a plastic surgery operating theatre, from New York City's electrical grid to the offices of the Pentagon, from a state-of-the-art wind farm to a testing ground for the cars of tomorrow, Little visits the most eccentric and exciting frontiers of the global energy landscape. As she introduces us to a range of characters - Saudi royalty, grassroots activists, the world's most respected politicians and an array of inventors - she argues that we are on the brink of a revolution in the way we source the energy that is so vital to us; there is an energy future beyond oil - as long as we have the courage and creativity to pursue it. Fresh, gutsy and optimistic, Power Trip will show you our world in a completely new way.		HarperCollins						ZZZ000000

9780007286140	Trouble in Paradise,Uncovering the Dark Secrets of Britain's Most Remote Island	Kathy Marks		"Pitcairn Island - populated by the descendants of the Bounty mutineers - is Britain's remotest outpost and home to just 47 people. Far out in the South Pacific, isolated, ignored and apparently idyllic, it remained virtually cut off for two centuries until shocking allegations brought it to the world's attention." "In 2000, British police arrived on Pitcairn to investigate alarming claims - they would uncover a culture of systematic child abuse, stretching back over forty years. The legal process that followed was unique in British experience: police and judges were brought onto the island, and defendants, lawyers, investigators and journalists lived side by side in the tiny community." "Kathy Marks, the Independent's Asia Pacific correspondent, was one of six journalists allowed onto Pitcairn to cover the trials. Following the saga through to its conclusion in 2007, her account describes generations of shattered lives, a community torn apart and a paradise truly lost."--BOOK JACKET.	2008	Harper Perennial						ZZZ000000

9780007123261	Sorcerer's Moon	Julian May		The stunning conclusion to a powerful epic fantasy from the worldwide bestselling author of the Saga of the Pliocene Exile.For sixteen years King Conrig Ironcrown has ruled High Blenholme, battling both to preserve the Sovereignty he ruthlessly established over the four provinces of the island kingdom and to repel the invading Salka monsters that threaten them all. His hope for the future is his heir, Prince Orrion, whose betrothal to a princess of the province of Didion should assure the future peace of High Blenholme. But Orrion has no interest in the girl, and is determined to marry instead his childhood sweetheart, Lady Nyla.Orrion's madcap twin, Corodon, dreams up a scheme to keep Orry and Nyla together by asking the supernatural Beaconfolk, who appear as lights in the sky, for a magical intercession. The twins are unaware that the Beaconfolk are fighting their own battle with others of their kind; to them all humans, even princes, are but pawns to be used in their own conflict. Their granting of Orrion's wish comes in a manner the twins far from expected, and precipitates chaotic infighting amongst the folk of High Blenholme.As battles rage both on the ground and in the sky, the only hopes for peace can be found deep in King Conrig's murky past. His former spy, Deveron Austrey, has secret magical powers and no love for the Beaconfolk. And while many of his subjects no longer remember the King's first wife, Maudrayne, she has never forgotten that her son is the true heir to the throne of High Blenholme.	2007-08-06	Voyager						FIC009000

And more to the point, do you want to know? 'The Rise and Fall of the Queen of Suburbia is a darkly comic portrayal of marriage, relationships, neighbours and suburbia. Welcome to Littlehaven, where serving pineapple with cottage cheese at a dinner party is the very height of glamorous sophistication; where sulky teenagers join CND and obsess as much about the threat of nuclear war as they do about their latest acne outbreak; and where missing a Green Goddess-led aerobics session is the true definition of disaster. 'The Rise and Fall of the Queen of Suburbia' follows the intertwined stories of the inhabitants of Pollards Close in love and out of love, in marriage and in flagrante, in health and in sickness, in work and out of work, in triumph and in tragedy. 'The Rise and Fall of the Queen of Suburbia' is a black-hearted soap opera, a smart, sharp study of obsession, paranoia and class, set against an all-too-recognisable backdrop of the decade that taste forgot.	2006	HarperCollins						CGN000000

It consists of the contents of 'Box 18', a file into which the highly prolific Spike would put his writing and drawings as they came to him, but which never came to be published. The book also draws on previously unseen diaries and letters.

The popularity and significance of The Beatles is beyond comparison in our age ' in the UK alone, they released more than 40 number one singles and albums.But their impact extended well beyond their music.

Together with his wife Yoko Ono, he attempted to transform the world through non-musical means. Their bed-in in Amsterdam and Montreal, their black bag appearances on stage, their innocent flirting with political activists and radicals, all received massive media attention. These events were in search of world peace.John Lennon was shot dead by a mentally disturbed fan outside his New York apartment building on December 8, 1980.Featuring previously unseen photographs, this truly is the definitive John Lennon.	2009-05-28	HarperCollins						ZZZ000000

9780007246212	Living with the Laird,A Love Affair with a Man and His Mansion	Belinda Rathbone		A captivating memoir of one woman's relationship with a man and his mansion. 'I knew that when I married the man that I married the mansion,' begins Belinda Rahtbone's captivating memoir of her relationship with a Scottish laird - and with his 400-acre ancestral home 'The Guynd'. But there was also much that the urban American did not know when she abandoned her life in New York to become the unlikely chatelaine of this country estate in north-east Scotland after a whirlwind affair with its eccentric owner. Finding herself in a setting reminiscent of many a classic English novel, Rathbone recounts her story of dealing with a grand but crumbling Georgian mansion still recovering from the effects of two world wars, not to mention a hopelessly overgrown garden, troublesome tenants, and an intractable class system often too dangerous to navigate. With the persistence of the biographer she delves into local history, anecdotes and family papers in her attempt to understand the small Scottish community into which she has been thrown, and with the curiosity of a outsider she imbibes the country wisdom that surrounds her, from the value of dead elm trees and the intricate working of the slow-cooking Aga to how to pluck a pheasant and what to wear to a country ball. Like a letter home from a strange land, Living With the Laird gives a unique view into the Scottish countryside of today that is both wry and poignant, combining a warm, Bill Bryson-esque view of British society with a fascinating portrait of an historic house and its many colourful inhabitants. Whether tackling her husband's habit of hoarding bottles of 30-year-old raspberry vinegar and pots of crystallised blackcurrant jam in their icy kitchen, or struggling to revive the fortunes of the rundown Georgian mansion, Living With the Laird tells a larger story: a tale of what happens when two cultures and two worlds - the old and the new - collide.	2007-01-04	Harper Perennial						ZZZ000000

9780007213320	Animals	Keith Ridgway		A novel of confusion and paranoia, love and doubt, fear and hysteria: unsettling, unhinged, provocative and bestially funny, 'Animals' is for human beings everywhere. Keith Ridgway's third novel is a psychological menagerie of confusion, paranoia, searching and love. Narrated by an illustrator who can no longer draw, it tells of the sudden and inexplicable collapse of a private life, and the subsequent stubborn search for a place from which to take stock. We are surrounded here - by unsafe or haunted buildings, by artists and capitalists who flirt with terror, by writers and actresses and the deals they have made with unreality, and by the artificial, utterly constructed, scripted city in which we have agreed to live out a version of living. But there are cracks in the facade, and there are stirrings under the floorboards, and there animals everywhere you look, if only you'd dare to look for them. Unsettling, unhinged, provocative and richly funny, 'Animals' is for human beings everywhere.	2007	Harper Perennial						FIC025000
9780007135097	Mishima's Sword,Travels in Search of a Samurai Legend	Christopher Ross		The stunning book from Christopher Ross, Sunday Times top 10 bestselling author of 'Tunnel Visions'. In 1970 Japan's most famous writer, Yukio Mishima, cut open his stomach and was then beheaded with his own antique sword. His anachronistic suicide has been called many things: a desperate heroic gesture; a work of art; a political protest; the antics of a madman. But which is correct? And what became of Mishima's sword? Thirty years later Christopher Ross sets out for Japan on the trail of those who might have answers: craftsmen and critics; soldiers and swordsmen; boyfriends and biographers; even the man who taught Mishima hara-kiri. Like his best-selling 'Tunnel Visions: Journeys of an Underground Philosopher', Christopher Ross has written another unclassifiable blend of travel writing, autobiography and philosophical enquiry to create a mesmeric account of modern Japan and the peculiar death that haunts it to this day.	2006-11-01	Harper Perennial						ZZZ000000

9780006552109	Kings Last Song	Geoff Ryman		A great king brings peace to a warring nation. Centuries later his writings will bring hope to those facing the tragic legacy of modern Cambodia's bloody history. When archaeologists discover a book written on gold leaves at Angkor Wat, everyone wants a piece of the action. But the King, the Army and the UN are all outflanked when the precious artefact is kidnapped, along with Professor Luc Andrade, who was accompanying it to the capital for restoration. Luckily for Luc, his love and respect for Cambodia have won him many friends, including ex-Khmer Rouge cadre Map and the young moto-boy William. Both equally determined to rescue the man they consider their mentor and recover the golden book, they form an unlikely bond. But William is unaware of just how closely Map's bloody past affects him. The book contains the words and wisdom of King Jayavarman VII, the Buddhist ruler who united a war-torn Cambodia in the twelfth century and together with his enlightened wife created a kingdom that was a haven of peace and learning. His extraordinary story is skilfully interwoven with the tales of Luc, Map and William to create an unforgettable and dazzling evocation of the spirit of Cambodia and her peoples in all their beauty and tragedy.	2007	HarperCollins						ZZZ000000
9780007111220	The Trial,A History from Socrates to O. J. Simpson	Sadakat Kadri		In an extraordinary history of the criminal trial, Sadakat Kadri shows with wit, legal insight and a travel writer's eye for detail, how the irrationality of the past lives on in the legal systems of the present. A bold and brilliant debut from a prize-winning new writer.'The Trial' spans a vast distance in time, opening in the dread silence of the Egyptian Hall of the Dead and ending with the melodramas and hubbub of the twenty-first century trial circus. Reconciliation and vengeance, secrecy and spectacle, superstition and reason all intertwine continually. The book crosses from the marbled courtrooms of Athens through the ordeal pits of Anglo-Saxon England, past the torture chambers of the Inquisition to the judicial theatres of seventeenth-century Salem, and from 1930s Moscow and post-war Nuremberg to the virtual courtrooms of modern Hollywood.Kadri shows throughout how the trial has always been concerned with doing more than guaranteeing fairness and holding human beings to account for their deliberate crimes. He recounts how insentient and irrational defendants from caterpillars to corpses were once summonsed to court, before being exiled for their failure to attend or sentenced to die again - and argues that the same urge to punish lives on in today's trials of children and the mentally ill. But although Justice's sword has always been double-edged - as ready to destroy a community's enemies as to defend its dreams of due process - the judicial contest also operates to enshrine some of the western world's most cherished values. The show trials of Stalin's Soviet Union were shams, but Guantanamo Bay and Abu Ghraib are a reminder that a lack of a trial is equally unjust, and at a time when our constitutional landscape seems to be melting away, an appreciation of the criminal courtroom's history is more necessary than ever. As the government of Tony Blair launches an almost annual attempt to truncate trial by jury, and as authorities on both sides of the Atlantic are indefinitely detaining people in the name of an endless war on terror, 'The Trial' could hardly be more timely.	2006-07-03	Harper Perennial						ZZZ000000

9780007160532	Wordsworth and Coleridge,The Friendship	Adam Sisman		The first book to explore the extraordinary story of the legendary friendship -" and quarrel -" between Wordsworth and Coleridge, two giants of English Romanticism. Wordsworth and Coleridge's passionate intimacy, shared ambition and subsequent estrangement contribute to a tragic tale. But Sisman's biography of this most remarkable friendship -" the first to devote itself wholly to exploring the impact of their relationship on each other -" seeks to re-examine the orthodox assumption that these two poets flourished as a result of it. Instead, Sisman argues that it was a meeting that may well have been disastrous for both: for it was Wordsworth's rejection of Coleridge, and not primarily his opium addiction, that destroyed the latter as a poet, and that Coleridge's impossible ambitions for Wordsworth pushed the latter towards failure and disappointment. Underlying the poignancy of the tale is the intriguing subject of the influence one writer can have on another. Sisman seeks to answer fundamental questions about this relationship: why was Wordsworth so reliant on Coleridge, and why was he so easily swayed in the most critical decision of his career? Was it in Coleridge's nature to play second fiddle? Would it, in fact, have been better for both men if they had never met?	2007-09-03	Harper Perennial						ZZZ000000
9780007241828	Toast,The Story of a Boy's Hunger	Nigel Slater		Top food writer Nigel Slater's eat-and-tell autobiography. Detailing all the food, recipes and cooking that have marked his passage from greedy schoolboy to great food writer, this is also a catalogue of how the British have eaten over the last three decades. 'Toast' is Nigel Slater's truly extraordinary story of a childhood remembered through food. Whether relating his mother's ritual burning of the toast, his father's dreaded Boxing Day stew or such culinary highlights as Arctic Roll and Grilled Grapefruit (then considered somehting of a status symbol in Wolverhampton) this remarkable memoir vividly recreates daily life in sixties surburban England. His mother was a chops-and-peas sort of cook, exasperated by the highs and lows of a temperamental AGA, a finicky little son and the asthma that was to prove fatal. His father was a honey-and-crumpets man who could occasionally go off 'crack' like a gun. When Nigel's widowed father takes on a housekeeper with social aspirations and a talent in the kitchen, the following years become a heartbreaking cooking contest for his father's affections. But as he slowly loses the battle, Nigel finds a new outlet for his culinary talents, and we witness the birth of what was to become a lifelong passion for food. Nigel's likes and dislikes, aversions and sweet-toothed weaknesses form a fascinating and amusing backdrop to this incredibly moving and deliciously evocative memoir of childhood, adolescence and sexual awakening.	2007-03-01	HarperCollins						ZZZ000000

9780007233090	A Year in Green Tea and Tuk-Tuks,My Unlikely Adventure Creating an Eco Farm in Sri Lanka	Rory Spowers		BBC journalist and environmentalist Rory Spowers wanted to finally live his dream and abandon life in London for a more ecologically sustainable lifestyle. Moving with his wife and two toddler sons to a 60-acre abandoned tea estate in Sri Lanka, Rory sets out to create a model organic farm there and earn his livelihood from the land. The fascinating story begins with the tsunami and Rory's sudden involvement with the relief efforts, and charts the course of his adventures over 12 months culminating in the launch of his new business (making a living by selling the produce he grows). It chronicles the highs and lows of this radical change, and reveals what it takes to live a sustainable life. It will also include tips for those of you who wish to live a more environmentally friendly life. Spowers' writing in 'Three Men on a Bike', which recounted his story of buying the Goodies' bicycle and riding it across Africa for charity, was compared with Bryson, Palin and Hawks' for his storytelling, humour and intrepid spirit. Spowers' narrative brims with adventure, harrowing moments, and small triumphs as he comes to know the people and the land and works toward creating his dream of a sustainable, model forest garden.	2007-03-22	HarperElement						ZZZ000000

9780007165452	The other side of you	Salley Vickers		The brilliant new novel from the bestselling author of 'Mr Golightly's Holiday' and 'Miss Garnet's Angel'. 'There is no cure for being alive.' Thus speaks Dr David McBride, a psychiatrist for whom death exerts an unusual draw. As a young child he witnessed the death of his six-year-old brother and it is this traumatic event which has shaped his own personality and choice of profession. One day a failed suicide, Elizabeth Cruikshank, is admitted to his hospital. She is unusually reticent and it is not until he recalls a painting by Caravaggio that she finally yields up her story. We learn of Elizabeth Cruikshank's dereliction of trust, and the man she has lost, through David's narration. As her story unfolds David finds his own life being touched by her account and a haunting sense that the 'other side' of his elusive patient has a strange resonance for him, too. Set partly in Rome, 'The Other Side of You' explores the theme of redemption through love and art, which has become a hallmark of Salley Vickers's acclaimed work. As with her other highly popular novels this is a many-layered and subtly audacious story, which traces the boundaries of life and death and the difficult possibilities of repentance.	2007-03-29	Harper Perennial						ZZZ000000

9780007131693	A savage kingdom,Virginia and the founding of English America	Benjamin Woolley		Stunning epic history of the first Virginia Colony and the true story of Pocahontas, to coincide with the colony's 400th anniversary in 2007. Four hundred years ago, a small group of Englishmen landed on the shores of Chesapeake Bay, and set about colonizing the land they had dubbed Virginia. Within months their tiny, precarious settlement faced extinction. Yet somehow, through some of the worst weather conditions in recorded history, in the face of deadly faction fighting, political sabotage, Indian hostility and Spanish threats, they prevailed, laying the foundation of an English-speaking America. Drawing on new discoveries in the British archives and neglected primary sources, 'Savage Kingdom' challenges the prevailing view that the Virginia enterprise was driven by profit and crippled by incompetence. The colonization of America was a bold, even reckless political adventure, driven by a sense of imperial destiny, and dogged by official hostility. It was part of a 'heroical design' to create a New World free of the convulsive forces that were destroying the old one. Unlike other books published so far on Jamestown 'Savage Kingdom' aims to capture the epic scale of the story by setting the Virginia venture in a global context that reaches from Paris to the Orinoco Delta, from Angola to New England, from the Ottoman Empire to the chiefdoms of the Blue Ridge Mountains. Woolley also reveals new evidence brought against key figures of the venture such as the 'charge of immorality' against the man selected to be the colony's first religious minister; the accusations of treasonous talk levelled against Bartholomew Gosnold, the prime mover of the enterprise, and the connections between the expedition's mysterious third-in-command, John Radcliffe, and England's spy network.	2007	HarperPress						ZZZ000000

Sites of natural and cultural significance have been preserved as World Heritage Sites since 1972 with 851 locations now on the official list.

In The Jesus Papers Michael Baigent reveals the truth about Jesus's life and tackles controversial questions, such as whether or not there is incontrovertible proof that Jesus Christ survived the crucifixion. Twenty years ago Michael Baigent and his colleagues stunned the world with a controversial theory that Jesus Christ and Mary Magdalene married and founded a holy bloodline. His bestselling book Holy Blood, Holy Grail (with co-authors Henry Lincoln and Richard Leigh) became an international publishing phenomenon and was one of the sources for Dan Brown's novel The Da Vinci Code. Now, with two additional decades of research behind him, Baigent's The Jesus Papers presents explosive new evidence that challenges everything we know about the life and death of Jesus. · Who could have aided and abetted Jesus and why? · Where could Jesus have done after the crucifixion? · What is the truth behind the creation of the New Testament? · Who is working to keep the truth buried and why? Taking us back to sites that over the last twenty years he has meticulously explored, studied, and in some instances excavated for the first time, Baigent provides a detailed account of his groundbreaking discoveries, including many never-before-seen photos.	2006	Harper Element						REL006710
9780007232468	Kingdom come	J. G. Ballard		A new masterpiece of fiction from J. G. Ballard which asks, could Consumerism turn into Facism? Richard Pearson, unemployed advertising executive and life-long rebel, is driving out to Brooklands, a motorway town on the M25. A few weeks earlier his father was fatally wounded at the Metro-Centre, a vast shopping mall in the centre of this apparently peaceful town, when a deranged mental patient opened fire on a crowd of shoppers. When the main suspect is released without charge thanks to the dubious testimony of self-styled pillars of the community '¬" including Julia Goodwin, the doctor who treated his father on his deathbed '¬" Richard suspects that there is more to his father's death than meets the eye, a more sinister element lurking behind the pristine facades of the labyrinthine mall. Determined to unravel the mystery, Richard soon realises that the Metro-Centre, with its round-the-clock cable channel and sports clubs, lies at the very heart of his father's death. Consumerism rules the lives of everyone in the motorway towns and feeds the cravings of this bored community with its desperate need for something new, whatever the cost. Riots frequently terrorise the streets, immigrant communities are set upon by roving bands of hooligans and sports events mushroom into jingoistic political rallies. Gradually, Richard finds himself drawn into this world, caught up in the workings of the mall, exposed to the insides of the consumer dream, and starts upon dismantling this wayward vision his advertising career helped to found'¬¦ In this gripping, dystopian tour de force, J.G. Ballard holds up a mirror to middle England, reflecting an unsettling image of suburbia and revealing the darker forces at work beneath the gloss of consumerism and flag-waving patriotism.	2006	Fourth Estate						ZZZ000000

9780007224937	Portrait of an Unknown Woman	Vanora Bennett		Perfect for fans of 'Girl with a Pearl Earring', this is a remarkable love story with a background of religious and political turmoil in Tudor England. The year is 1527. Hans Holbein makes his first visit to England, sent by the great Erasmus to paint Thomas More, courtier, scholar, patron, and his family. More's splendid house on the river in Chelsea is at the centre of Tudor society, frequented by distinguished astronomers, artists, politicians and men of religion, as well as wards of court, protègès and many others. Two visitors to the great house find themselves irresistibly drawn to Meg Giggs, one of More's foster daughters. John Clement - dark, tall, elegant - studying to be a doctor, is a man of compelling presence and mysterious background. The other man is Holbein himself - warm, ebullient, radical and a painter of great renown. Meg finds herself powerfully drawn to these two wildly contrasting men. She will love one, and marry the other. A wonderful, rich novel, presenting the atmosphere of this Tudor household as rarely achieved, with an astounding ability to present to us the world of Holbein's paintings as well as a gallery of vividly realised characters.	2007-06-27	Harper Collins						ZZZ000000

Steve Biddulph		Steve Biddulph, the favourite number one name in parenting psychology - and bestselling author of Raising Boys - examines how different childcare options are likely to affect you and your child in this rivetting and highly topical bookThis topical book tackles a key issue all new parents face. Steve Biddulph looks at childcare choices and the dilemmas that so often arise:- 'I want to stay at home with my child but don't know how I can' - 'I don't know what is better: nursery, creche or childminder'- 'if other people look after my child will it affect its development and happiness?'It examines the two-income 'slaves to work' culture in the UK and how in the past ten years, the number of babies and toddlers under three who are spending all day (8am to 6pm) in nurseries has quadrupled. Biddulph urges caution and warns that the hurried and disconnected way that families now live their lives could be damaging to a whole new generation's mental stability and development.The book is an eye-opener in terms of child development and provides useful case studies from parents who are stay-at-home and those using all-day or part-time childcare - groups sociologists have named 'slammers' and 'sliders' respectively.	2006-01	HarperThorsons						ZZZ000000

9780007158041	Shopped,the shocking power of British supermarkets	Joanna Blythman		An elegant demolition of the supermarket miracle, this book charts the impact that supermarkets have had on every aspect of our lives and culture. Did you know... · Almost 50% of supermarket fruit and vegetables contain pesticide residues? · UK supermarkets make 40p on every £1 spent on bananas while plantations workers are paid just 1p? · Supermarkets instill a climate of fear amongst their suppliers? · Every time a supermarket opens the local community loses on average 276 jobs? In the 1970s, British supermarkets had only 10% of the UK's grocery spend. Now they swallow up 80%, influencing how we shop, what we eat, how we spend our leisure time, how much rubbish we generate, even the very look of our physical environment. Award-winning food writer Joanna Blythman investigates the enormous impact that these big box retailers are having on our lives. She meets the farmers who are selling food to supermarkets for less than they need to survive and the wholesalers who have been eliminated from the supply chain; she travels to suburban retail parks to meet the teenagers and part-timers who stack our shelves and reveals the hoops third world suppliers must jump through to earn supermarket contracts. This thought-provoking, witty and sometimes chilling voyage of discovery is sure to make you think twice before you enthusiastically reach for that supermarket trolley again.	2005-02-07	Harper Perennial						ZZZ000000

9780007274024	Shakespeare ( Hb )	Bill Bryson		William Shakespeare, the most celebrated poet in the English language, left behind nearly a million words of text, but his biography has long been a thicket of wild supposition arranged around scant facts. With a steady hand and his trademark wit, Bill Bryson sorts through this colorful muddle to reveal the man himself. Bryson documents the efforts of earlier scholars, from today's most respected academics to eccentrics like Delia Bacon, an American who developed a firm but unsubstantiated conviction that her namesake Francis Bacon was the true author of Shakespeare's plays - she spent months in silence at Bacon's home, 'absorbing atmospheres' that bolstered her theory. With shades of his famous travelogues, Bryson records episodes in his research, including a visit to a bunker-like basement room in Washington, D.C., where the world's largest collection of First Folios is housed. Bryson celebrates Shakespeare as a writer of unimaginable talent and enormous inventiveness, a coiner of phrases ('vanish into thin air', 'foregone conclusion', 'one fell swoop') that even today have a home at the tips of our tongues. His Shakespeare is like no-one else's - the beneficiary of Bryson's genial nature, his engaging scepticism, and a gift for storytelling unrivalled in our time.		HarperCollins						ZZZ000000

9780007152674	The third woman	Mark Burnell		In a world where everyone and everything has its price, who do you trust? The Third Woman is a powerful and fascinating thriller following the adventures of Burnell's unique heroine Stephanie Patrick. From conspiracy to terrorism, Vienna to Paris, will she find the truth? The world isn't run by governments. It's run by corporations. In other words, everything and everyone has a price. Stephanie Patrick operates under a number of names; Petra Reuter, known as a gun for hire, is probably the one she uses most frequently. She used to work for the government. Now she works for herself. Robert Newman, who spends more nights at 35,000 feet than in his own bed, is an international troubleshooter. But twenty years at the top have still not purged for him the ghosts of the past. A plea for help from an old friend draws Stephanie to Paris, where she narrowly survives a terrorist attack, an outrage that according to the authorities was masterminded by Petra Reuter. Betrayed in every way, pursued ruthlessly by a faceless enemy, her identity stolen from her, Stephanie seizes a hostage to give her a slim possibility of escape. But is the encounter with Robert Newman really just chance? Hunted from Paris to Vienna, Stephanie and Newman are forced together to survive. Yet the more she learns, the closer Newman seems to be to the heart of the conspiracy. Stephanie becomes sure of only one thing: that the answers will lie with the person who she knows as The Third Woman. '洗The Third Woman' is vividly contemporary, with a welcome return for a unique heroine.	2006-07-13	HarperCollins						ZZZ000000

I猬"ve decided to be very zen about it. I have lost two husbands, my parents, my brother, countless friends; it is just one loss after another. You might as well get used it.猬" So muses the author猬"s mother in this poignant and humorous memoir about mothers and daughters, and the miraculous things that happen when daughters become mothers. Loss is a way of life for both Catherine L. Burns and her mother, but where it made the daughter ravenous for contact, it made the mother lose her appetite for people. While the two always had a fierce attachment, by turns intimate and tumultuous, decades of fractious and contentious and frustrating interactions found a reprieve after the birth of Catherine猬"s daughter, Olive. Witty and direct, weaving back and forth in time, the book charts the transformation of this volatile and unique mother-daughter relationship from longing to connection. A book about love, mortality, and the nature of family bonds, 猬~It Hit Me Like A Ton of Bricks猬" is a must-read for anyone trying to navigate their way through the distance between their fantasies of love and the realities of family relationships.	2006-07-03	Fourth Estate						ZZZ000000

9780007214594	Band of Brigands,The First Men in Tanks	Christy Campbell		Inspired by a visit to northeast France to witness the excavation of a remarkably intact World War I tank from beneath a suburban vegetable plot near the town of Cambrai, Christy Campbell—then defense correspondent of the Sunday Telegraph—began to piece together the little-known story of the young men who formed the British Tank Corps. Very few of them had been professional soldiers; they were car enthusiasts and mechanics, plumbers, motorcyclists, circus performers, and polar explorers. One officer declared "I have never seen such a band of brigands in my life." They had trained in conditions of great secrecy in the grounds of a stately home in East Anglia and were originally known as the Heavy Branch, Machine Gun Corps. The word "tank" itself was deliberately chosen to mislead. Men in tanks saw the face of battle at its most brutal. Their task was to crush and burn the enemy out of his fortifications, and to carve a path for the infantry so they could finish the job with bayonet and grenade. Captured tank crews were beaten up or sometimes shot out of hand by the Germans. They fought in their stifling armored boxes packed with gas and explosives, aware that at any moment a shell-hit might incinerate them all. Christy Campbell has combed contemporary diaries and letters and later recollections to tell properly for the first time the robust yet harrowing story of how the first men in tanks went to war. The time frame is 1916-18, with a coda on how German blitzkrieg ideas developed from an English root.	2007-10-22	HarperPress						ZZZ000000

9780007172313	The Lady and the Unicorn	Tracy Chevalier		The wonderful novel from the muchndash;loved author of 'Girl with a Pearl Earring' and 'Falling Angels'. The Lady and the Unicorn tapestries are a set of six medieval tapestries. Beautiful, intricate and expertly made, they are also mysterious in their origin and meaning. Tapestries give an appearance of order and continuity, as if designed and made by one person, belying the complicated process required to create them. Weavers, patrons, designers, artists, merchants and apprentices were involved in their making, and behind them were the wives, daughters and servants who exercised influences over their men. Like the many strands of wool and silk woven together into one cloth, so these people came together in a complex dance to create the whole picture. Jean le Viste, a newly wealthy member of the French court, commissions the tapestries to hang in his chateau. Nicolas, his chosen designer, meets le Viste's wife Genevieve and his daughter Claude, both of whom take a keen interest in the tapestries. From Paris, Nicolas moves to a weaver's workshop in Brussels in order to complete the commission. The creation of the tapestries brings together people who would not otherwise meet ndash; their lives become entangled, and so do their desires. As they fall in love, are shunned, take revenge, find unrequited love, turn to the church or to pagan ideals, the tapestries become to each an ideal vision of life ndash; yet all discover that they are unable to make this ideal world their own.	2006-12-04	HarperCollins Publishers Limited						ZZZ000000

9780007229697	What's left?,how liberals lost their way	Nick Cohen		From the much-loved, witty and excoriating voice of journalist Nick Cohen, a powerful and irreverent dissection of the agonies, idiocies and compromises of mainstream liberal thought. Nick Cohen comes from the Left. While growing up, his mother would search the supermarket shelves for politically reputable citrus fruit and despair. When, at the age of 13, he found out that his kind and thoughtful English teacher voted Conservative, he nearly fell off his chair: 'To be good, you had to be on the Left.' Today he's no less confused. When he looks around him, in the aftermath of the invasion of Iraq, he sees a community of Left-leaning liberals standing on their heads. Why is it that apologies for a militant Islam that stands for everything the liberal-Left is against come from a section of the Left? After the American and British wars in Bosnia and Kosovo against Slobodan Milosevic's ethnic cleansers, why were men and women of the Left denying the existence of Serb concentration camps? Why is Palestine a cause for the liberal-Left, but not, for instance, China, the Sudan, Zimbabwe or North Korea? Why can't those who say they support the Palestinian cause tell you what type of Palestine they would like to see? After the 9/11 attacks on New York and Washington why were you as likely to read that a sinister conspiracy of Jews controlled American or British foreign policy in a liberal literary journal as in a neo-Nazi rag? It's easy to know what the Left is fighting against - the evils of Bush and corporations - but what and, more to the point, who are they fighting for? As he tours the follies of the Left, Nick Cohen asks us to reconsider what it means to be liberal in this confused and topsy-turvy time. With the angry satire of Swift, he reclaims the values of democracy and solidarity that united the movement against fascism, and asks: What's Left?	2007	Fourth Estate						ZZZ000000

9780007241682	The naked civil servant	Quentin Crisp		The flamboyant autobiography of the uninhibited and wonderful Quentin Crisp. Quentin Crisp was a true original. With his mauve hair and flamboyant sense of style, by the time of his death he was widely hailed as one of the great British eccentrics. An openly gay man in a less tolerant era (he once declared himself the "Stately Homo of England") he was born on Christmas Day 1908 to "middle-class, middle-brow" parents, and sent to boarding school in Derbyshire ("a cross between a monastery and a prison"). He moved to London in the 1920s, earning money through stints nude modelling, prostitution and book designing. After a radio appearance in 1968 he decided to write his autobiography. Initially it sold only 3,500 copies and the future looked bleak ('If at first you don't succeed,' Crisp once said, 'failure may be your style'). But after it adaptation into a drama for the BBC in 1975, books began to fly off the shelves and Crisp became an overnight celebrity. Three years later he made his off-Broadway debut in 'An Evening with Quentin Crisp' and followed it with his version of Lady Bracknell in 'The Importance of Being Ernest'. Over the years further books followed: 'How to Have a Life-Style', 'Manners From Heaven', 'How to Be a Virgin' and 'Resident Alien', his acclaimed New York diaries. He died in November 1999, just one month before his 91st birthday.	2007-03-01	Harper Perennial						ZZZ000000

GL, or Glycaemic Load, gets better results than GI (Glycaemic Index) because it helps you manage the quality AND the quantity of the food you eat. For example, on a GI diet chocolate is off the menu because a single bar of chocolate and a truckload of chocolate have the same bad rating. It's a different story on GL: you can cheat a little and still enjoy your chocolate fix. This diet is so easy and so indulgent that you'll hardly notice you are on it until your unwanted pounds disappear. ? Simple eating guidelines - no rigid rules ?

9780007216840	The year of magical thinking	Joan Didion		From one of America's iconic writers, a stunning book of electric honesty and passion.Joan Didion explores an intensely personal yet universal experience: a portrait of a marriage-and a life, in good times and bad-that will speak to anyone who has ever loved a husband or wife or child.Several days before Christmas 2003, John Gregory Dunne and Joan Didion saw their only daughter, Quintana, fall ill with what seemed at first flu, then pneumonia, then complete septic shock. She was put into an induced coma and placed on life support. Days later-the night before New Year's Eve-the Dunnes were just sitting down to dinner after visiting the hospital when John Gregory Dunne suffered a massive and fatal coronary. In a second, this close, symbiotic partnership of 40 years was over. Four weeks later, their daughter pulled through. Two months after that, arriving at LAX, she collapsed and underwent six hours of brain surgery at UCLA Medical Center to relieve a massive hematoma.This powerful book is Didion's "attempt to make sense of the weeks and then months that cut loose any fixed idea I ever had about death, about illness . . . about marriage and children and memory . . . about the shallowness of sanity, about life itself."	2005	Fourth Estate						ZZZ000000

9780007214624	Finding Moonshine	Marcus du Sautoy		This new book from the author of 'The Music of the Primes' combines a personal insight into the mind of a working mathematician with the story of one of the biggest adventures in mathematics: the search for symmetry.This is the story of how humankind has come to its understanding of the bizarre world of symmetry ā a subject of fundamental significance to the way we interpret the world around us.Our eyes and minds are drawn to symmetrical objects, from the sphere to the swastika, the pyramid to the pentagon. Symmetry indicates a dynamic relationship or connection between objects, and it is all-pervasive: in chemistry and physics the concept of symmetry explains the structure of crystals or the theory of fundamental particles; in evolutionary biology, the natural world exploits symmetry in the fight for survival; symmetry and the breaking of symmetry are central to ideas in art, architecture and music; the mathematics of symmetry is even exploited in industry, for example to find efficient ways to store more music on a CD or to keep your mobile phone conversation from cracking up through interference.Marcus du Sautoy constantly strives to push his own boundaries to find ways in which to share the excitement of mathematics with a broader audience; this book charts his own personal quest to master one of the most innate and intangible concepts, and to demonstrate the intricacy and beauty of the world around us.	2009-05-14	HarperCollins Publishers Limited						ZZZ000000

9780007196708	The Sad Truth about Happiness	Anne Giardini		A first novel - bittersweet and comic - on the elusive nature of happiness, from the eldest daughter of novelist Carol Shields.Maggie, the 31-year-old middle child who is just a little too predictable, is ready for change - but not the kind that swoops down on her in The Sad Truth about Happiness. Maggie's roommate Rebecca devises questionnaires for women's magazines, and she is convinced her newest one can predict the exact date of death of anyone who answers the questions honestly. Rebecca, they learn, is going to live to a healthy old age. When Maggie fills it in she is puzzled to discover that she'll live to be 132 years old, until she realises that in fact the test is telling her she actually has only 132 days more, and is scheduled to die shortly before her next birthday. The fact that she has answered the 'are you happy' question with a 'no' appears to have shaved decades off her life expectancy, and she resolves to live differently; if she can become happy in her three remaining months, perhaps she can wrest her fate free of the prediction.But with wry comedy, Maggie's life takes a dramatic turn for the worse from that very moment. Trying to protect her younger sister Lucy from the attentions of a spurned boyfriend, Maggie finds herself on the run with Lucy's newborn child. And this is only the beginning of her problems...Anne Giardini has written a poignant and sharply witty novel on the bonds between sisters, the pull of home, and the nature of happiness: elusive, fleeting, inspiring, infinitely variable. Her bittersweet portrait of domestic life spiralling out of control is the work of an important new voice and a natural storyteller.	2006-02-06	Harper Perennial						ZZZ000000

She reveals the growing evidence that some of the products aimed at young children have little or no 'educational benefit' and that these toys could even impair early development.Moreover she examines the huge negative impact of selling products to such young children and argues that kids are now experiencing the anxiety, hyper-competitiveness and depression usually found in adults and caused by the effects of rampant consumerism.Buy Buy Baby is an important contribution to the parenting and business book markets and is sure to permanently alter what and how we buy for our kids.	2007	HarperCollins						ZZZ000000

9780007232406	The Sailor in the Wardrobe	Hugo Hamilton		Following on from the success of 'The Speckled People', Hugo Hamilton's new memoir recounts the summer he spent working at a local harbour in Ireland, at a time of tremendous fear and mistrust. Young Hugo longs to be released from the confused identity he has inherited from his German mother and Irish father, but the backdrop of his mother's shame at the hands of Allied soldiers in the aftermath of the Second World War, along with his German cousin's mysterious disappearance somewhere on the Irish West Coast and the spiralling troubles in the north, seems determined to trap him in history. In an attempt to break free of his past, Hugo rebels against his father's strict and crusading regime and turns to the exciting new world of rock and roll, still a taboo subject in the family home. His job at the local harbour, rather than offering a welcome respite from his speckled world, entangles him in a bitter feud between two fishermen - one Catholic, one Protestant. Hugo listens to the missing persons bulletins going out on the radio for his German cousin, and watches the unfolding harbour duel end in drowning before he can finally escape the ropes of history.	2006	Harper Perennial						HIS027100

The phone call sends Ellen on a brief and darkly nostalgic trip that provides a thumbnail sketch of her past: an abusive first husband (now dead); a stillborn child; her clairvoyant "seeing" that landed her in a Belfast mental hospital; her initial encounter with Liam, who later becomes her second husband. The narrative follows their relationship, as sculptor Liam struggles to make a name for himself in the art world and Ellen's clairvoyance transforms into the power to heal the sick. At Liam's insistence, and with the encouragement of her friend Catherine, a former nun, Ellen begins working as a healer, forcing her to come to terms with her new role in the community and confront the prejudices (both her own and others') that separate northerners from southerners.	2006-09-30	HarperCollins						ZZZ000000

9780007241743	Seabiscuit,The True Story of Three Men and a Racehorse	Laura Hillenbrand		The true story of three men and their dreams for a racehorse ' Seabiscuit ' which encompasses a pivotal moment in American history: its resurrection from the Depression. In 1936, as Margaret Mitchell's 'Gone with the Wind' was published, the habits of 19th-century America were finally consigned to history. In their place, modern America was born. But what defined this new era? Nothing more than the story of Seabiscuit, a stunted colt with asymmetrical knees that had for two years been hacked around no-good race tracks. Yet by 1937 Seabiscuit could draw crowds of 60,000 and had more newspaper column inches devoted to him than Mussolini, Hitler or Roosevelt. During an appearance at the Santa Anita Handicap, his popularity peaked. America had gone to the races for the first time since the Depression and fallen in love with a misshapen colt of great character. Now it wanted a winner. 'Seabiscuit' tells the tale of one horse's fluctuating fortunes, and the three men who devoted so much time to the dream: Tom Smith, a former Wild West Showman and Seabiscuit's trainer; Red Pollard, who was abandoned by his poverty stricken family at a race track but became Seabiscuit's rider; and Charles Howard, a pioneer car manufacturer in San Francisco in the 1920s who financed the entire project. These three combined to create the legend of Seabiscuit and epitomise a dream for the emerging new America.	2007-02-05	HarperCollins						SPO021000

The King's Cavalla Academy has been ravaged by the Speck plague. The disease has decimated the ranks of both cadets and instructors, and even the survivors remain sickly. Many have been forced to relinquish their military ambitions and return to their families to face lives of dependency and disappointment. As the Academy infirmary empties, Cadet Nevare Burvelle also prepares to journey home, to attend his brother Rosse's wedding. Far from being a broken man, Nevare is hale and hearty after his convalescence. He has defeated his nemesis, Tree Woman and freed himself of the Speck magic that infected him and attempted to turn him against his own people. A bright future awaits him as a commissioned officer betrothed to a beautiful young noblewoman.

9780007196203	Renegade's Magic	Robin Hobb		The final book in the Soldier Son from the author of the Tawny Man and Farseer trilogies, following on from the bestselling Shaman's Crossing and Forest Mage. The people of Getty's town remember the death of their cemetery soldier vividly. They remember believing him guilty of unspeakable crimes, condemning him, and then watching as other men of his unit beat him until he no longer drew breath. But Nevare Burvelle didn't die that day, though everyone believes they saw it happen. He was cornered by a power far more intractable than an angry mob. When he was a boy, the magic of the Specks ' the dapple-skinned tribes of the frontier forests ' claimed Nevare as a saviour; severing his soul in two, naming his stolen half Soldier's Boy and shaping him into a weapon to halt the Gernian expansion into their lands and save their beloved ancestor trees. Until now Nevare has defied the magic, unable to accept his traitorous fate. But the magic has won: it has extinguished his once golden future, devastated his family and has now turned his own people against him. Faced with endangering the only loved-ones he has left, Nevare has no choice but to surrender to its will and enter the forest. But surrendering to his Speck destiny is only the beginning of his trials. Before he submits completely, Nevare makes one desperate last attempt to deter the Gernians from the Barrier Mountains without causing them harm. But the magic accepts no compromise. Exhausted, Nevare can no longer suppress his traitorous Speck self, Soldiers Boy. Losing control, he becomes a prisoner in his own body; able only to watch helplessly as his other half takes Soldier's Boy is determined to stop the Gernian expansion at all cost, and unlike Nevare, he has no love, nor sympathy for his spirit-twin's world.	2008-07-07	Harper Collins Publ.

9780007227389	Apocalypse 2012,An Optimist Investigation Into the End of Civilization	Lawrence E. Joseph		is the world really coming to an end in 2012? According to the Bible, i Ching and the Mayans it is. And, wouldn't you know it, there are already several rock bands, including Houston's very own Downfall 2012, getting ready to party. 'Apocalypse 2012' is cheerful sceptic Laurence E Joseph's investigation into the 2012 Doomsday phenomenon. With its mixture of hard science, investigative reportage and cast of colourful characters, 'Apocaplyse 2012' is 'Fast Food Nation' for the terminally paranoid. Journalist and science writer Laurence E. Joseph is our incisive and witty guide unravelling the religious, astrological and mystical prophecies behind the potentially earth-shattering events of 2012. And at the core of this book is Joseph's investigation into the growing number of scientific researchers trying to figure out why conditions around our planet are becoming so bizarre. His adventures include: · Hooking up with the Voluntary Human Extinction Movement whose cheerful motto 'Live Long and Die Out' is now available as a tattoo. · Meeting the scientists who are trying to figure out why the present state of the sun is so worrisome - is it just going through a phase or is something major going on? · Visiting Yellowstone National Park to see whether the seething supervolcano could soon stop civilisation dead in its tracks. · Exploring the possibility of a terrorist attack that could plunge the whole Northern Hemisphere into the equivalent of a nuclear winter. So, if 2012 really is going to be a year of unprecedented catastrophe, what can we do to increase our odds of surviving it? Should we head for the Kentucky hills or hightail it to Western Africa, where an Australian Doomesday 2012 enthusiast is already staking his claim, or perhaps we'd be better blasting off for solar systems unknown?	2007-02-19	HarperElement						ZZZ000000
9780007241750	The Perfect Storm,A True Story of Man Against the Sea	Sebastian Junger		The worst storm in history seen from the wheelhouse of a doomed fishing trawler; a mesmerisingly vivid account of a natural hell from a perspective that offers no escape. The 'perfect storm' is a once-in-a-hundred-years combination: a high pressure system from the Great Lakes, running into storm winds over an Atlantic island - Sable Island - and colliding with a weather system from the Caribbean: Hurricane Grace. This is the story of that storm, told through the accounts of individual fishing boats caught up in the maelstrom, their families waiting anxiously for news of their return, the rescue services scrambled to save them. It is the story of the old battle between the fisherman and the sea, between man and Nature, that awesome and capricious power which can transform the surface of the Atlantic into an impossible tumult of water walls and gaping voids, with the capacity to break an oil tanker in two. In spare, lyrical prose 'The Perfect Storm' describes what happened when the Andrea Gail looked into the wrathful face of the perfect storm.	2007-02-05	HarperCollins Publishers Limited						ZZZ000000

9780007150700	The great mortality,an intimate history of the Black Death	John Kelly		A compelling history of the Black Death that scoured Europe in the mid-14th century killing 25 million people. It was one of the worst human disasters in history.'The bodies were sparsely covered that the dogs dragged them forth and devoured them ... And believing it to be the end of the world, no one wept for the dead, for all expected to die.' Agnolo di Turo, Siena, 1348In just over a thousand days from 1347 to 1351 the 'Black Death' travelled across medieval Europe killing thirty per cent of its population. It was a catastrophe that touched the lives of every individual on the continent. The deadly Y. Pestis virus entered Europe in October 1347 by Genoese galley at Messina, Sicily. In the spring of 1348 it was devastating the cities of central Italy, by June 1348 it had reached France and Spain, and by August England. At St Mary's, Ashwell, Hertfordshire, an anonymous hand carved the following inscription for 1349: 'Wretched, terrible, destructive year, the remnants of the people alone remain.'According to the Foster scale, a kind of Richter scale of human disaster, the plague of 1347-51 is the second worst catastrophe in recorded history. Only World War II produced more death, physical damage, and emotional suffering. Defence analysts use it as the measure of thermonuclear war - in geographical extent, abruptness and casualties.In The Great Mortality John Kelly retraces the journey of the Black Death using original source material - diary fragments, letters and manuscripts. It is the devastating portrait of a continent gripped by an epidemic, but also a very personal story, narrated by the individuals whose lives were touched by it.	2006	Harper Perennial						ZZZ000000

The Men Who Joined The Royal Flying Corps In 1914 Were The Original Heroes Of Flying, Treading Into Unknown Territory, And Paving The Way For Later Aerial Combat. They Became Icons For The Soldiers In The Trenches, And A Stark Contrast To The Hundreds On The Ground Fighting Faceless Hundreds As Men Fought Aircraft To Aircraft And Man To Man For The First Time The Air Became A Battlefield Of Its Own. In 1914 Aircraft Were A Questionable Technology, Used For Only Basic Reconnaissance. But By 1918, Hastened By The Terrible War, Aircraft Were Understood To Be The Future Of Modern Warfare. The War Changed Flying Forever. The Wright Brothers' Achievements Of A Mere 10 Years Earlier And Blériot'S Crossing Of The Channel Just A Few Years Before The War Seemed A Distant Memory As Aircraft Became Killing Machines The War Becoming The Ancestor Of The Fearsome Air Wars Of Later Years. The Stories Are Presented To The Reader In A Frank And Open Way, Revealing The Feelings Of The Men Who Defended The Trenches From Above And Witnessed The War From A Completely Different Perspective. The Adventures Of These Men Are Almost Totally Unknown, And This Book Will Tell Their Story, In Their Own Words, For The First Time. The Tale Of Men Who Rewrote The Rules Of Military Engagement And Changed The Course Of Modern History As A Result.	2008-06-05	HarperCollins UK						ZZZ000000

9780007196630	A Thousand Years of Good Prayers	Yiyun Li		Brilliant and original, 'A Thousand Years of Good Prayers' introduces a remarkable first collection of stories about China from an author set to become a major literary talent. In this extraordinary first collection, Yiyun Li brings us a modern China facing up to a complex history of repression and guilt. In 'Immortality', winner of the Paris Review prize, a young man bears a striking resemblance to the dictator, and so finds a strange kind of calling. In 'Extra', first published in the New Yorker, a Chinese woman, alone in middle age, befriends a young boy who has become an outcast in a remote country school. In their friendship, we see how love can begin to overcome the strictures that dominate their lives. In turn horrifying and breathtakingly lyrical, Yiyun Li, a new and talented young Chinese writer, confronts the silence that dominated the history of her country, and illuminates how mythology, politics, history and culture intersect with personality. She leaves us with an enduring vision of a country undergoing tremendous change.	2006	Harper Perennial						ZZZ000000

9780007202690	Torn Water	John Lynch		A lyrically told and exquisitely tender story of innocence and loss. 'He remembers when he was very young standing by water...How he had got there or where the pond was he couldn't remember, but he can vaguely recall a larger hand on his and being led through the high rooms of a large building, to a large garden, where bees wove dozy patterns in the air. At the bottom of this garden lay the large pond, and he remembers a face bending to meet his and whispering that he would be back in a little while. So he stood where he had been left, his small feet pointing at the stonework of the pond's rim. He remembers a wind brewing in the tops of the trees and tearing at the water of the pond for a moment, before subsiding, his face blurring into focus like a TV channel being tuned.' When James Lavery's father is blown to bits by a bomb he intended to maim and kill others with, the boy keeps him alive in his imagination as a superhero, escaping the daily grind of school, his mother's drinking and his own acute loneliness by inventing extraordinary adventures for them both. But, gradually, through the agonies of adolescence James begins to understand the real cost of his father's weak and deluded heroism. It is only when he falls in love himself, during a summer away from his tortured home life, that James finally begins to understand the true complexities of love, life and death...	2007-01-02	Harper Perennial						ZZZ000000

Along the way he considers the crucial role of the wealthy patrons who gambled huge sums on early matches; the truth behind the legends that have grown up around the famous Hambledon Club; changes in rules and techniques—including the transition from underarm to overarm bowling—the long standing but often blurred distinction between 'gentlemen' and 'players;' the coming of the MCC and its role as the supreme arbiter of the game; the spread of cricket throughout the British Empire; and the emergence of the county game and international competition.	2007	HarperPress						ZZZ000000

For India, The Tournament Turned Out To Be A National Tragedy; For The First Time In Years There Was A Palpable Weakening Of The Foundations Of The Country'S Universal Obsession. For The Hosts, West Indies, It Almost Put An End To The Dream Of Creating A Unified Political, Social And Economic Entity. For Australia, The World Cup Triumph Was Accompanied By A Sense Of Déjà Vu Which Was Evident In The Muted Celebrations. In The Final Analysis, For Reasons Of Money, The Ninth Edition Of The Cup Was Bloated To Accommodate Sixteen Teams For Over A Month And A Half. Yet The Tournament Had No Distinctive Quality And No Particular Innovation, Its Format Was Dull And Its Title Rendered Meaningless In The Process. What It Did Generate Was Heated Discussions About The Market, About The Nature Of Profits, And About Sportsmanship Or The Increasing Lack Of It. In This Book, Cricket Historian Boria Majumdar Analyses The Many Events And Aspects Of The World Cup, From The Shocking Death Of Bob Woolmer To The Dwindling Television Revenues In India. He Examines The Controversial Legacy Of The Tournament And The Importance Of Cricket, If Any, In The Shaping Of Contemporary Societies.	2007	HarperCollins						ZZZ000000

Martin&Gardner Dozois&Daniel Abraham		A powerful tale of betrayal, trickery and sheer human grit from a dream-team of authors In a fight outside a bar Ramon Espejo kills a man. Next day, all hell breaks loose. The dead man was a big shot, a diplomat on a mission to the out-world of São Paulo. Ramon goes on the run, heading north toward unexplored territory, land so far only glimpsed from orbit during the first colony surveys. Ramon has gone from being nothing in the hills of Mexico to being nothing on São Paulo. He makes a bare living prospecting for minerals. Maybe God meant him to be poor, or he wouldn't have made him so mean. He can't even remember why he killed the European, only the drinking, and the rage that followed. Better to be alone in the wild landscape â¦ off the map, beyond law and civilization. Each trip out he's sure will be the big one that'll make him rich. This one, too. Instead he finds something else, something terrifying. Or rather, it finds him, and uses him: as humans are used by species more intelligent than themselves. But Ramon Espejo is about to prove what a man is capable of. Ramon is about to demonstrate what it is to be human; to be angry, intelligent and alive. And he is about to discover his function in the broad flow of the universe. And why it was he killed the diplomat in the first place...	2008-06-02	VOYAGER PRESS						FIC028000

With humour, compassion (and exasperation) Masters slowly works back through post-office heists, prison riots and the exact day Stuart discovered violence, to unfold the reasons why he changed from a happy-go-lucky little boy into a polydrug-addicted-alcoholic Jekyll and Hyde personality, with a fondness for what he called 'little strips of silver' (knives to you and me).Funny, despairing, brilliantly written and full of surprises: this is the most original and moving biography of recent years.	2006	Harper Perennial						ZZZ000000

Now He Presents Further Astonishing Evidence That It Was Also Chinese Advances In Science, Art, And Technology That Formed The Basis Of The European Renaissance And Our Modern World. In His Bestselling Book 1421: The Year China Discovered The World, Gavin Menzies Presented Controversial And Compelling Evidence That Chinese Fleets Beat Columbus, Cook And Magellan To The New World. But His Research Has Led Him To Astonishing New Discoveries That Chinese Influence On Western Culture Didn'T Stop There. Until Now, Scholars Have Considered That The Italian Renaissance - The Basis Of Our Modern Western World - Came About As A Result Of A Re-Examining The Ideas Of Classical Greece And Rome. However, A Stunning Reappraisal Of History Is About To Be Published. Gavin Menzies Makes The Startling Argument That A Sophisticated Chinese Delegation Visited Italy In 1434, Sparked The Renaissance, And Forever Changed The Course Of Western Civilization. After That Date The Authority Of Aristotle And Ptolemy Was Overturned And Artistic Conventions Challenged, As Was Arabic Astronomy And Cartography. Florence And Venice Of The 15Th Century Attracted Traders From Across The World. Menzies Presents Astonishing Evidence That A Large Chinese Fleet, Official Ambassadors Of The Emperor, Arrived In Tuscany In 1434 Where They Met With Pope Eugenius Iv In Florence. A Mass Of Information Was Offered By The Chinese Delegation To The Pope And His Entourage - Concerning World Maps (Which Menzies Argues Were Later Given To Columbus), Astronomy, Mathematics, Art, Printing, Architecture, Steel Manufacture, Civil Engineering, Military Machines, Surveying, Cartography, Genetics, And More. It Was This Gift Of Knowledge That Sparked The Inventiveness Of The Renaissance - Da Vinci'S Inventions, The Copernican Revolution, Galileo, Etc. Following 1434, Europeans Embraced Chinese Intellectual Ideas, Discoveries, And Inventions, Which Formed The Basis Of European Civilization Just As Much As Greek Thought And Roman Law. In Short, China Provided The Spark That Set The Renaissance Ablaze.	2008-01-01	HarperCollins						ZZZ000000

9780007161911	The Savage Garden	Mark Mills		A beautiful Tuscan villa, a mysterious garden, two hidden murders ' one from the 16th century, one from the twentieth ' and a family riven by dark secrets combine in this evocative, intriguing mystery set in post-War Italy. In 1958, Adam Strickland, a young Cambridge scholar, travels to the Villa Docci in Tuscany to study a sixteenth-century garden. Designed and laid out by a grieving husband to the memory of his dead wife, it is a mysterious world of statues, grottoes, meandering rills and classical inscriptions. But tragedy has hit the Docci family more recently. The German occupation during World War 2 had a devastating impact on them, and the tensions between collaborators and partisans were played out within their own tight circle. Adam is fascinated by the Doccis and increasingly aware that there are dangerous secrets hidden within the family domain.The garden itself starts to exercise a powerful influence over his imagination, its iconography seeming to point to some deeper, darker truth than was first apparent. And what really lay behind a killing at the villa towards the end of the war? Past and present, love and intrigue, intertwine in an evocative mystery which vividly captures the experience of an innocent abroad in the uncertain world of post-War Italy.	2007-02-05	HarperCollins						ZZZ000000

Or, perhaps, during the Victorian era or World War II? The experience of childhood is one that has altered beyond recognition over the centuries as children's roles in the world have shifted with the times. First heard on Radio 4, The Voices of Children is Michael Morpurgo's thought-provoking new play illuminating the ways in which the concept of childhood has changed over the past 1000 years. As the author says of writing the play: 'a?|I found myself on a journey of discovery as intense as childhood itself. Here was an aspect of childhood I had known very little about, the history of it, the invention of it. It is a story I have found often disturbing, and always enlightening. And it's a universal story, for each of us in their own way has lived and invented their own childhood. Childhoods I have discovered, may have changed, been reinvented through the ages, but children have not'.	2008-01-07	HarperCollins Publishers Limited						JNF017000

9780007178483	Reading Lolita in Tehran,a memoir in books	Azar Nafisi		Every Thursday morning for two years in the Islamic Republic of Iran, a bold and inspired teacher named Azar Nafisi secretly gathered seven of her most committed female students to read forbidden Western classics. As Islamic morality squads staged arbitrary raids in Tehran, fundamentalists seized hold of the universities, and a blind censor stifled artistic expression, the girls in Azar Nafisi’s living room risked removing their veils and immersed themselves in the worlds of Jane Austen, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Henry James, and Vladimir Nabokov. In this extraordinary memoir, their stories become intertwined with the ones they are reading. Reading Lolita in Tehran is a remarkable exploration of resilience in the face of tyranny and a celebration of the liberating power of literature.	2004-02-02	Fourth Estate						ZZZ000000

9780007232819	The Portrait	Iain Pears		A dark and disturbing novel of suspense, set at the turn of the 20th century, by the bestselling author of 'An Instance of the Fingerpost'.The windswept isle of Houat, off the coast of Brittany, is no picturesque artists' colony. At the turn of the twentieth century, life is harsh and rustic. So why did Henry MacAlpine forsake London - where he had been fêted by critics and gallery owners, his works exhibited alongside the likes of Cezanne and Van Gogh - to make his home in this remote outpost?The truth begins to emerge when, four years into his exile, MacAlpine receives his first visitor. Influential art critic William Naysmith has come to the island to sit for a portrait. Over the course of the sitting, the power balance between the two men shifts dramatically as the critic whose pen could anoint or destroy careers becomes a passive subject. And as the painter struggles to capture Nasmith's true character on canvas, a story unfolds - one of betrayal, hypocrisy, forbidden love, suicide and ultimately murder.'The Portrait' is a darkly atmospheric, psychologically complex, macabre and chilling novel from a master storyteller.	2006-08-07	Harper Perennial						FIC025000

9780007261017	The Abstinence Teacher	Tom Perrotta		A sharp, funny and beautifully observed satire about the disturbing influence of the Christian right from one of Americaās most cherished authors.Ruth Ramsey went too far. She hadn't noticed the changing climate. A Sex Ed teacher āchampioningā oral sex!? Not now, not in this Americaā¦Cherished by her high school pupils as someone who'd tell it straight, after one innocent classroom indiscretion Ruth suddenly finds the curriculum she has taught for nigh on 15 years worryingly out of vogue. As the scandal flares up and attracts the unwelcome eye of the local evangelical Church, the appeasing high-school principal forces her into advocating a pro-abstinence agenda in the classroom that is at odds with all conventional wisdom. But jaded though she is by her recent divorce and fruitless search for a new love, Ruth is determined that the values she grew up with will not be sacrificed to Puritanism.It is a syllabus change which should be considered a victory by Tim Mason ā recovering addict, local football coach and recent convert to the same plaintiff Church ā but his new found faith is constantly put to the test by the temptations of his former life. When he makes the gesture of leading his football team in prayer after a hard-fought victory, in which Ruth's daughter Maggie starred, he manages not only to incur the wrathful attention of her mother, but to cement his position as the star evangelist of his church ā an office he is none too sure about occupying.Scathing, witty and brilliantly observed,āThe Abstinence Teacher' is a cutting portrayal of modern America and the influence of the Christian right from the acclaimed, bestselling author of 'Election' and 'Little Children'.	2009-02-05	Harper Collins Publ.

The sinking of the whaleship Essex by an enraged spermwhale in the Pacific in November 1820 set in motion one of the most dramatic sea stories of all time: the twenty sailors who survived the wreck took to three small boats (one of which was again attacked by a whale) and only eight of them survived their subsequent 90-day ordeal, after resorting to cannibalising their mates. Three months after the Essex was broken up, the whaleship Dauphin, cruising off the coast of South America, spotted a small boat in the open ocean. As they pulled alongside they saw piles of bones in the bottom of the boat, at least two skeletons' worth, with two survivors - almost skeletons themselves - sucking the marrow from the bones of their dead ship-mates.	2007	HarperCollins						ZZZ000000

9780007230662	Caravaggio,Painter of Miracles	Francine Prose		NBA finalist Francine Prose takes on a great artist whose life was brief and paradoxical, more loathed in his own time than any modern artist since. This is a study of why revolutionary art can be reviled in its own time and revered in another. Building on a biographical tradition that can be traced back to Aubrey's 'Brief Lives', Dr Johnson's 'Lives of the Poets' and Lytton Strachey's 'Eminent Victorians', this exciting and ground-breaking new series pairs great biographers, historians and novelists with iconic subjects, the writing bristling with original and distinctive points of view. Francine Prose's life of Caravaggio evokes the genius of this great artist through a brilliant reading of his paintings. Caravaggio defied the aesthetic conventions of his time; his use of ordinary people, realistically portrayed - street boys, prostitutes, the poor, the aged - was a profound and revolutionary innovation that left its mark on generations of artists. His insistence on painting from nature, on rendering the emotional truth of experience, whether religious or secular, makes him an artist who speaks across the centuries to our own time. Born in 1571 near Milan, Michelangelo Merisi (da Caravaggio) moved to Rome when he was 21 years old. He became a brilliant and successful artist, protected by the influential Cardinal del Monte and other patrons. But he was also a man of the streets who couldn't seem to free himself from its brawls and vendettas. In 1606 he fled Rome, apparently after killing another man in a dispute. He spent his last years in exile, at once celebrated for his art and tormented by his enemies. Through it all, he produced masterpieces of astonishing complexity and power. Eventually he received a pardon from the Pope, only to die, in mysterious circumstances, on the way back to Rome in 1610. Francine Prose presents the brief but tumultuous life of one of the greatest of all painters with passion and acute sensitivity.	2007-03-05	HarperCollins Publishers Limited						ZZZ000000

9780007213313	Francis Crick,discoverer of the genetic code	Matt Ridley		Acclaimed author Matt Ridley traces the colourful life of the man who discovered the structure of DNA, the building blocks of life. Building on a biographical tradition that can be traced back to Aubrey's a??Brief Livesa??, Dr Johnson's a??Lives of the Poetsa?? and Lytton Strachey's a??Eminent Victoriansa??, this exciting and ground-breaking new series pairs great biographers, historians and novelists with iconic subjects, the writing bristling with original and distinctive points of view. On 28 February 1953, Francis Crick walked into the Eagle pub in Cambridge and announced that he and his American colleague James Watson a??had found the secret of lifea??. In fact, they had indeed done so. That morning, Crick and Watson had worked out the structure of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid). They had discovered its 'double helix' form, one which could replicate itself, confirming theories that it carried life's hereditary information. Matt Ridley's life of Crick begins with his birth in 1916 at the home of a shoe factory owner, his early explosive experiments at primary school and time developing torpedoes in the Navy. After his seismic DNA discovery, which won him the Nobel Prize before he'd even gained a PhD, the scientist's later work was rarely uncontroversial. From California, he proposed that life began when micro-organisms from another planet were dropped here by a spaceship sent to Earth, and maintained that the 'human soul' was entirely explicable in terms of brain activity. Matt Ridley's entertaining account traces the colourful and entirely original work behind one of mankind's greatest discoveries and displays the life of a scientist considered of the very first rank.	2008-02-04	Harper Perennial						ZZZ000000
9780007190768	Waterloo,Napoleon's last gamble	Andrew Roberts		The Making History Series is launched in paperback with an exciting retelling of one of the moments that shook the world - Waterloo, one of the truly decisive battles of history.The illustrious Making History Series, edited by Lisa Jardine and Amanda Foreman, explores an eclectic mix of history's tipping points.In Waterloo, Roberts provides not only a fizzing account of one of the most significant 48 hour periods of all time, but also a startling interrogation into the methodology of history - is it possible to create an accurate picture from a single standpoint? What we can say for certain about the battle is that it ended forever of the great personal epics. The career of Napoleon was brought to a shuddering halt on the evening of 18th June 1815. Interwoven in the clear-cut narrative are exciting revelations brought to light by recent research: accident rather than design led to the crucial cavalry debacle that lost the battle. Amongst the all-too-human explanation for the blunder that cost Napoleon his throne, Roberts sets the political, strategic and historical scene, and finally shows why Waterloo was such an important historical punctuation mark.The generation after Waterloo saw the birth of the modern era: ghastly as the carnage here was, henceforth the wars of the future were fought with infinitely more ghastly methods of trenches, machine-guns, directed starvation, concentration camps, and aerial bombardment. By the time of the Great War, chivalry was utterly dead. The honour of bright uniform and tangible spirit of élan met their final dance at Waterloo.	2006-02-06	Harper Perennial						ZZZ000000
9780007307616	Wetlands	Charlotte Roche		With her jaunty dissection of the sex life and the private grooming habits of the novel's 18-year-old narrator, Helen Memel, Charlotte Roche has turned the previously unspeakable into the national conversation in Germany.Since its debut in February, the novel (āFeuchtgebieteā, in German) has sold more than 680,000 copies, and is the biggest selling book on Amazon anywhere in the world.The book is a headlong dash through every crevice and byproduct, physical and psychological, of its narrator's body and mind. It is difficult to overstate the raunchiness of the novel. Wetlands opens in a hospital room after an intimate shaving accident. It gives a detailed topography of Helen's hemorrhoids, continues into the subject of anal intercourse and only gains momentum from there, eventually reaching avocado pits as objects of female sexual satisfaction and ā here is where the debate kicks in ā just possibly female empowerment. Clearly the novel has struck a nerve, catching a wave of popular interest in renewing the debate over women's roles and image in society.	2009-06-25	HarperCollins Publishers Limited						ZZZ000000

9780007315123	Virolution	Frank Ryan		The extraordinary role of viruses in evolution and how this is revolutionising biology and medicineDarwin's theory of evolution is still the greatest breakthrough in biological science. His explanation of the role of natural selection in driving the evolution of life on earth depended on steady variation of living things over time â but he was unable to explain how this variation occurred. In the 150 years since publication of the Origin of Species, we have discovered three main sources for this variation â mutation, hybridisation and epigenetics. Then on Sunday, 12th February, 2001 the evidence for perhaps the most extraordinary cause of variation was simultaneously released by two organisations â the code for the entire human genome. Not only was the human genome unbelievably simple (it is only ten times more complicated than a bacteria), but embedded in the code were large fragments that were derived from viruses â fragments that were vital to evolution of all organisms and the evidence for a fourth and vital source of variation â viruses.Virolution is the product of Dr Frank Ryan's decade of research at the frontiers of this new science â now called viral symbiosis â and the amazing revolution that it has had in these few years. As scientists begin to look for evidence of viral involvement in more and more processes, they have discovered that they are vital in nearly every case. And with this understanding comes the possibility of manipulating the role of the viruses to help fight a huge range of diseases.	2009-06-25	HarperCollins Publishers Limited						ZZZ000000

All will be revealed in this hilarious and endlessly inventive sequel to '¬~The Case of the Missing Books'¬".	2006	Harper Perennial						FIC022000
9780007246649	Calorie Counting	Kate Santon		No matter what kind of diet you follow, you will have to consume fewer calories than you burn off. Easy to say and more difficult to do, so this book covers the theory, the planning and living with a low-calorie diet, complete with recipes and detailed information on the nutritional values of many foods. Whatever the diet, controlling calories is the key to long-term success. You have to consume fewer calories than you burn off before your body will shed some of its fat stores. Other diets that restrict your intake of carbs or fats, or provide complex equations about the ratio of one food group to another, will only work if you end up consuming fewer calories. The book covers the following topics in that helpful, supporting style that is the hallmark of the Need to Know series, also reflected in the companion volume, Need to Know GI + GL, produced by the same team: ? How are calories burned? Burning calories through exercise. Finding your own RMR. The dangers of cutting down too drastically. ? Methods of measuring BMI, body fat, waist-to-hip ratio and so forth. Finding your ideal weight. Working out how many calories you will be able to consume during the weight-loss and maintenance phases of your diet. ? Components of a healthy diet - nutrients that you have to include in your diet on a daily and weekly basis. The importance of portion control. ? Some sample menus for breakfast, lunch, dinner and snacks, divided into categories depending on their calorie count. ? Becoming calorie-aware: once you understand the basics, you shouldn't have to sit with pen, paper and calculator every evening figuring out if you have 100 spare calories for a glass of wine, but at the beginning you are advised to note everything down. ? Some low-cal recipes, including the 'lite' version of certain household favourites. Including: roasted vegetable lasagne, Thai green chicken curry, teriyaki beef, trout with almonds, wild mushroom risotto, low-cal fish and chips, and some tasty low-cal desserts. ? Ways of introducing more activity into your day-to-day life. Exercises for the desk-bound. Motivating yourself to do more sports. ? Listings - the nutritional composition of basic, non-branded foods so that you can calculate the calorie counts for your own favourite dishes.	2007-02-08	HarperCollins Publishers Limited						ZZZ000000

9780007241835	Longitude	Dava Sobel		The dramatic human story of an epic scientific quest: the search for the solution of how to calculate longitude and the unlikely triumph of an English genius. Anyone alive in the 18th century would have known that 'the longitude problem' was the thorniest scientific dilemma of the day - and had been for centuries. Lacking the ability to measure their longitude, sailors throughout the great ages of exploration had been literally lost at sea as soon as they lost sight of land. Thousands of lives, and the increasing fortunes of nations, hung on a resolution. The quest for a solution had occupied scientists and their patrons for the better part of two centuries when, in 1714, Parliament upped the ante by offering a king's ransom (#20,000) to anyone whose method or device proved successful. Countless quacks weighed in with preposterous suggestions. The scientific establishment throughout Europe - from Galileo to Sir Isaac Newton - had mapped the heavens in both hemispheres in its certain pursuit of a celestial answer. In stark contrast, one man, John Harrison, dared to imagine a mechanical solution. Full of heroism and chicanery, brilliance and the absurd, 'Longitude' is also a fascinating brief history of astronomy, navigation and clockmaking.	2007	Harper Perennial						SCI066000

9780007219896	Saving fish from drowning	Amy Tan		The highly-anticipated new novel from the best-selling author of 'The Joy Luck Club' and 'The Bonesetter's Daughter'.On an ill-fated art expedition of the Southern Shan State in Burma, eleven Americans leave their Floating Island Resort for a Christmas morning tour - and disappear. Through the twists of fate, curses, and just plain human error, they find themselves deep in the Burma jungle, where they encounter a tribe awaiting the return of the leader and the mythical book of wisdom that will protect them from the ravages and destruction of the Myanmar military regime.Filled with Amy Tan's signature 'idiosyncratic, sympathetic characters, haunting images, historical complexity, significant contemporary themes, and suspenseful mystery' (Los Angeles Times), 'Saving Fish from Drowning' seduces the reader with a façade of Buddhist illusions, magical tricks, and light comedy, even as the absurd and picaresque spiral into a gripping morality tale about the consequences of intentions - both good and bad - and of the shared responsibility that individuals must accept for the actions of others.	2005	Fourth Estate						ZZZ000000
9780007100811	The World of Gerard Mercator,The Mapmaker Who Revolutionised Geography	Andrew Taylor		The true story of Gerard Mercator, the greatest map-maker of all time, who was condemned to death as a heretic.'Geographie and Chronologie I may call the Sunne and the Moone, the right eye and the left, of all history'In The World of Gerard Mercator, Andrew Taylor chronicles both the story of a great astronomer and mathematician, who was condemned to death as a heretic, and the history of that most fascinating conjunction of science and art: the drawing of maps. Gerard Mercator was born in Flanders in 1512. In addition to creating accurate globes of the earth and the stars, he was the first person to use latitude and longitude for navigation and he created the most-used map of all time: Mercator's Projection is still the standard view of the world, the one we all envisage when we think of a map of the globe. Simply finding the best solution to the impossible challenge of reproducing the spherical world on a flat sheet of paper was a considerable achievement in itself - something geographers and map-makers had been trying to do for centuries, but Mercator also created the map of the world that would form the basis of the modern age, an image of the continents for the common man.Until Mercator's Projection, maps offered a pictorial encyclopaedia to an illiterate world, and that world stretched far beyond the knowledge and travels of most mapmakers. It is this evolution of mapmaking from art to science that forms the backdrop to the story of Mercator, from the days of Herodotus and Strabo when fabulous creatures were supposed to inhabit the fringes of the world to the great mappae mundi of Hereford and Ebsdorf. The Greek geographer Pytheas claimed to have visited the far north of Britain to establish the limits of the habitable world; but further north, he claimed that the earth, air and sea coalesced into a jellyfish-like gelatinous suspension which made life impossible.The World of Gerard Mercator is a brilliantly readable and absolutely fascinating history for the general reader, describing how our worldview came into being.	2005-01-01	Harper Perennial						ZZZ000000

9780007247844	Hybrids,Saga Competition Winner	David Thorpe		A thrilling sci-fi novel set in a believeable - and terrifying - near future... Hybrids is the winning entry to the HarperCollins nationwide new author competition with SAGA Magazine.Johnny Online and Kestrella are hybrids - victims of "Creep", a pandemic sweeping the country which causes sufferers to merge with items of technology when over-exposed to their use. Kestrella persuades a wary Johnny to help her find her missing mother, but the Gene Police have other plans for him...Powerful, compelling, and narrated alternately by Johnny and Kes, it questions our human dependence on technology, and our reactions in the face of nationwide panic. This was the outstanding winner of the Children's Book Writing Competition run in conjunction with SAGA Magazine.Orange-prize winning author Helen Dunmore - one of the judges - says: "The writing is sharp, the dialogue good, and the action pacey and page-turning. But there's a real depth to this story, too. Like all good fiction it makes the reader see the world in a different light."	2007-05-17	HarperCollins Publishers Limited						ZZZ000000

9780007280599	TALES FROM THE PERILOUS REALM,ROVERANDOM AND OTHER CLASSIC FAERY STORIES	J R R Tolkien&Alan Lee		Available for the first time in one volume, this is the definitive collection of Tolkien's five acclaimed modern classic 'fairie' tales in the vein of 'The Hobbit', fully corrected and reset for this edition and all beautifully illustrated in pencil by the award-winning artist, Alan Lee.The five tales are written with the same skill, quality and charm that made The Hobbit a classic. Largely overlooked because of their short lengths, they are finally together in a volume which reaffirms Tolkien's place as a master storyteller for readers young and old.'¢ Roverandom is a toy dog who, enchanted by a sand sorcerer, gets to explore the world and encounter strange and fabulous creatures. '¢ Farmer Giles of Ham is fat and unheroic, but - having unwittingly managed to scare off a short-sighted giant - is called upon to do battle when a dragon comes to town; '¢ The Adventures of Tom Bombadil tells in verse of Tom's many adventures with hobbits, princesses, dwarves and trolls; '¢ Leaf by Niggle recounts the strange adventures of the painter Niggle who sets out to paint the perfect tree; '¢ Smith of Wootton Major journeys to the Land of Faery thanks to the magical ingredients of the Great Cake of the Feast of Good Children.This new collection is fully illustrated throughout by Oscar-winning artist, Alan Lee, who provides a wealth of pencil drawings to bring the stories to life as he did so memorably for The Hobbit and The Children of Húrin. Alan also provides an Afterword, in which he opens the door into illustrating Tolkien's world.World-renowned Tolkien author and expert, Tom Shippey, takes the reader through the hidden links in the tales to Tolkien's Middle-earth in his Introduction, and recounts their history and themes.Lastly, included as an appendix is Tolkien's most famous essay, "On Fairy-stories", in which he brilliantly discusses fairy-stories and their relationship to fantasy.Taken together, this rich collection of new and unknown work from the author of The Children of Húrin will provide the reader with a fascinating journey into lands as wild and strange as Middle-earth.	2009-04-24	HarperCollins Publishers Limited						ZZZ000000
9780007148387	War and peace,original version	Leo Tolstoy&Leo Tolstoy (graf)&Andrew Bromfield		A new version ''¬" the one Tolstoy originally intended, but has been hitherto unpublished ''¬" of Russia's most famous novel; with a different ending, fewer digressions and an altered view of Napoleon ''¬" it's time to look afresh at one of the world's favourite books. 'War and Peace' is a masterpiece ''¬" a panoramic portrait of Russian society and its descent into the Napoleonic Wars which for over a century has inspired reverential devotion among its readers. This new version is certain to provoke controversy and devotion in equal measures. A 'first draft' of the epic version known to all, it was completed in 1866 but never published. A closely guarded secret for a century and a half, the unveiling of the original version of 'War and Peace', with an ending different to that we all know, is of huge significance to students of Tolstoy. But it is also sure to prove fascinating to the general reader who will find it an invigorating and absorbing read. Free of the solemn philosophical wanderings, the drama and tragedy of this sweeping tale is reinforced. His characters remain central throughout, emphasising their own personal journeys, their loves and passions, their successes and failures and their own personal tragedies. 500 pages shorter, this is historical fiction at its most vivid and vital, and readers will marvel anew at Tolstoy's unique ability to conjure the lives and souls of Russia and the Russians in all their glory. For devotees who long for more, for those who struggled and didn't quite make it to the end, or for those who have always wanted to know what all the fuss is about, this is essential reading.	2007-03-29	Harper Perennial						ZZZ000000

It is there that Alex, on the run from something, concealed under a false identity, finds refuge but that arrival brings dramatic change to Motherlode. In the small settlement, no one asks questions about where you have come from or who you are. They all know each other's virtues and vices: the rules are few and their own justice swift, an Eden of a sort. But then Alex, who has discovered fellowship for the first time, finds a large gold nugget and with that one lucky strike, gold fever hits, everyone becomes a gold digger and outsiders of all kinds pour in. Houses, stores and streets replace the tents and mud paths. Wives, preachers, lawmen come to town and try to impose their order, their form of society on what they perceive as a lawless, godless community⬦and the past catches up with Alex. So will the community betray their Golden Boy? Will Alex's true identity be discovered? Will the prejudice now present in the town be able to destroy Emaline and the rich spirit of her inn?

Until her bossy grandmother shows up and announces that it is Jinni s 'duty' to drop everything and come and contest the upcoming Lok Sabha elections from their sleepy hometown, Bittora. Of course Jinni swears she won't. But she soon ends up swathed in cotton saris and frumpy blouses, battling prickly heat, corruption and accusations of nymphomania as candidate Sarojini Pande, a daughter of the illustrious Pande dynasty of Pavit Pradesh. And if life isn t fun enough already, her main opposition turns out to be Bittora ex-royal, Zain Altaf Khan   an irritatingly idealistic though undeniably lustworthy individual with whom Jinni shares a complicated history <br>Enlivened by Chauhan s characteristic brand of wicked humour and sexy romanticism, this is a rollicking new tale of young India.	2010	Haper Collins	432	English				FIC000000
