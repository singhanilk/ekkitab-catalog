9780340692288	Analyzing census microdata	Angela Dale&Ed Fieldhouse&Clare Holdsworth		The use of census microdata - which is the extremely detailed information collected through the 'ultracensusing' of a small number of households at the time of the last census - forms an important part of many research activities in subject areas as diverse as geography, demography, sociology, economics, politics and statistics. It is vital that the researchers know how the data was collected, which statistical techniques are useful and why, and how to model the data in order to draw inferences about the whole population. Analyzing Census Microdata meets and is relevant to a wide and international market. Analyzing Census Microdata - written by some of the leading authorities in the field - provides the first guide to the analysis of census microdata, with the basic statistical summary techniques presented in a clear and concise way.

9780340614273	The South African War, 1899-1902	Bill Nasson		The South African or Anglo-Boer War rounded off the British conquest of Southern Africa. While ultimate British victory was scarcely in doubt, the unsettling experience of having to field an army of 450,000 troops to break two of the world's tiniest agrarian states gave imperial society much to reflect upon, both during and after the conflict. To the Boer 'bittereinders' the outcome of the war was never anything other than a humiliation. Yet the defeat of Boer interests was less evident. Although much of the black population became involved in the conflict, white supremacy remained intact; and the successes of the Boers in the field, as well as the trials and tribulations of their families in defeat, restoked a nationalist Afrikaner identity, which would go on to become a key element in the policy of apartheid. Only now, a hundred years later, are some of the more baleful legacies of the war being addressed. Bill Nasson's lively new history is a crisp, up-to-date account not only of the military struggle but also of the whole web of miscalculations and shattered illusions that surrounded it and spread far beyond the battlefields.	1999	Arnold						ZZZ000000
9780340677469	Undoing place?,a geographical reader	Linda McDowell		Does geography affect our sense of "self"? How are social characteristics mapped out on the ground? And is there any "authentic" sense of place now, or are we increasingly "placeless"? Concentrating on the period between the end of the Second World War and the end of the century, this Reader argues that there is a reciprocal relationship between the constitution of places and people. Bringing together an interdisciplinary collection of articles for social and cultural geographers, this Reader critically examines the argument that the close associations of the 1950s between place (the home, the community and the nation state) and the social divisions (gender, class and nationality) are breaking down in the 1990s. Drawing out the oppositional movements in each decade, it seeks to show how the supposed stability of one and the mobility of the other are exaggerated.	1997-09-01	Arnold						ZZZ000000

9781741144567	Chappelli speaks out	Ashley Mallett		Ian Chappell, the man they call Chappelli, became Australia's Test cricket captain on 4 February 1971. In 1959, a sixteen-year-old Chappell was told to write down his cricket ambitions on a piece of paper and carry it with him always as a constant reminder of what he wanted to achieve in the game.So I took a piece of piece of paper and wrote, "My ambition is to captain Australia". Frankly, to this day I don't know why I wrote down these words because I don't think I had any great ambition to be captain of Australia. I think what happened was that I thought, "What is the highest thing you could achieve in Australian cricket?". The answer was logically to captain Australia. So that's what I wrote on my piece of paper. I still had it in my wallet the very day I learnt that I was to be picked to be Test captain in 1971. It had done its job, so after some time I threw it away.'In Chappelli Speaks Out, the man many regard to be one of Australia's greatest Test captains, talks frankly with Ashley Mallet about his years in cricket, other cricketers both past and present, the administration of the game and his involvement in sometimes controversial social causes such as the campaign against refugee detention centres. This is the story of a man who is as forthright as he is fair, and who led Australian cricket through its most successful and its most turbulent times.	2005-01	Allen & Unwin						ZZZ000000

9781741145762	Economics and the environment,a signalling and incentives approach	Ian Wills		Coordinating our use of the earth's natural resources is not easy. Resource users are many, their goals diverse, and their impacts on the environment often uncertain.How we use those resources depends on the signals and incentives we receive, from either the market or our governments. These systems encourage certain uses of natural resources, but they are not perfect. We harm the environment not out of malice, but because we do not know the consequences of our actions, or the incentives for harm are too great to ignore.Economics and the Environmentargues that, by lowering the cost and improving the quality of the necessary signals and incentives, we can better reconcile our diverse interests in the environment. It introduces an economic way of thinking about environmental issues, without assuming a background in economics:* how the economy and the environment interact* how resource use is coordinated in ideal market and planned economies* the barriers to ideal signalling and incentives in real markets and real government planning* the economist's tools for dealing with natural resource issues* the uncertainty and complexity of environmental issues: climate change, water rights, air pollution and overharvesting of common resources.This second edition of Economics and the Environmentis fully updated and includes new material on sustainability, valuation of environmental changes, the prospects for international cooperation under the Kyoto Protocol and the problems of defining and enforcing measures to protect biodiversity. It offers students in both economics and environmental studies programs a coherent framework for understanding our major environmental problems.Ian Wills succeeds in providing a fresh perspective . . . a very interesting and informative textbook.'Economic Record	2006	Allen & Unwin						ZZZ000000

9781741753578	Southern Theory	Raewyn Connell		In Southern TheoryRaewyn Connell presents the case for a new 'world social science' - one that is inclusive of many voices - by arguing for a more democratic global recognition of social theory from societies outside the dominant European and North American metropole.Intellectual production of the majority 'southern' world does in fact include theory, though its contribution is often marginalised and intellectually discredited by the metropole. Connell shows how social theory about the modern world from peripheral societies is equal in intellectual rigour and is often of greater political relevance to our changing world.Beginning with an examination of the hidden assumptions of modern general theory, Southern Theorylooks to the 'southern' social experience and the theories that have emerged from Australia, Indigenous peoples, Latin America, India, Africa, Islam and other post-colonial societies, as sources of important and vital contributions to world social science. These myriad theories offer valuable perspectives so crucial to the application of social theory in the contemporary world, having the power to transform the influence of the metropolitan hegemony on social thought by mutual regard and interaction.Southern Theoryis a major new work in social theory, drawing on anthropology, history, psychology, philosophy, economics and cultural studies, with wide-ranging implications for the social sciences in the 21st century.	2007	Allen & Unwin						ZZZ000000

Now it pervades every aspect of our lives.In Technoculture, Lelia Green focuses on the technologies of communication, from things we don't even think of as technology, like the alphabet or electricity, to the rapidly-developing world of cyberspace.

They do however need a sound understanding of the principles of press freedom and the ethical and legal limits of what can and should be reported.

9781741755220	The Trouble with Theory,The Educational Costs of Postmodernism	Gavin Kitching		Postmodern theory has engaged the hearts and heads of the brightest students because of its apparent political and social radicalism. Despite this Professor Gavin Kitching claims that, 'At the heart of postmodernism is very poor, deeply confused and misbegotten philosophy. As a result even the very best students who fall under its sway produce radically incoherent ideas about language, meaning, truth and reality.' This is not another conservative attack on postmodernism. Rather, it is a carefully considered analysis from a dedicated university teacher who is convinced that we have gone terribly astray. He shows that postmodern theory is at best irrelevant to, and at worst undermining of, persuasive political arguments, and reveals the basic philosophical confusion at its heart which makes this so. Essential reading for any student writing a thesis in the humanities and the social sciences, and for their teachers.	2008-09-01	Allen & Unwin						ZZZ000000

9780750637695	Project management for product and service improvement	Andrew Greasley		Industrial activity often involves the creation of a "project" as a means to bring about an improvement. Such projects vary in size from, say, the production and certification of a new airliner down to a quick mail-shot about a cheap holiday offer. However projects do not just happen. Successful ones are chosen carefully, analysed to maximise benefits, implemented logically and kept in control until their termination. Projects are not always new ventures. Most are initiated to bring about relatively minor improvements to existing products and services. Unfortunately the "divisions of labour" and specialist skills that are needed in large organisations mean that no individual can accomplish the project aims. With complex products and services it is rare that even a small team has all the required knowledge, flair and determination to drive a project through to its best possible conclusion. Much of the content of this book is suitable for incorporation into PC software and some of the techniques are available as a matter of routine amongst commercial packages. However it is the purpose of this text to introduce several project oriented topics at a basic level upon which more complex procedures may be built. The topics addressed are presented at undergraduate level and include many examples relevant to manufacturing and service industries.

9780632052660	Freshwater ecology,a scientific introduction	Gerry Closs&Barbara J. Downes&Andrew J. Boulton		Freshwater ecosystems are under increasing pressure as human populations grow and the need for clean water intensifies. The demand for ecologists and environmental managers who are trained in basic freshwater ecology has never been greater. Students and practitioners new to the field of freshwater ecology and management need a text that provides them with an accessible introduction to the key questions while still providing sufficient background on basic scientific methods.Gerry Closs, Barbara Downes and Andrew Boulton have written a text that meets the requirements of these students. Following an introduction to scientific methodology and its application to the study of ecology, several key concepts in freshwater ecology are reviewed using a wide range of scientific studies into fundamental and applied ecological questions. Key ecological questions that are explored in a freshwater context include the role of animal dispersal and predators on freshwater community structure and the impact of pollutants and introduced species on freshwater ecosystems.This book represents the only freshwater ecology textbook that is specifically aimed at an introductory level. It will also be a useful primer for students who have not previously taken a specialized freshwater course but who require an accessible overview of the subject. General reviews on the methods of science, influence of scale, and the main features of freshwater systems. Coverage of several fundamental and applied ecological questions.

9780851155791	Britten and the Far East,Asian influences in the music of Benjamin Britten	Mervyn Cooke		Investigations with accompanying CD into the influence of Eastern music on Britten's composition.Benjamin Britten's strong interest in the musical traditions of the Far East had a far-reaching influence on his compositional style; this book is the first to investigate the highly original cross-cultural synthesis he was able to achieve through the use of material borrowed from Balinese, Japanese and Indian music. Britten's visit to Indonesia and Japan in 1955-6 is reconstructed from archival sources, and shown to have had a profound impact on his subsequent work: the techniques of Balinese gamelan music were used in the ballet The Prince of the Pagodas (1957), and then became an essential feature of Britten's compositional style, at their most potent in Death in Venice (1973); and the No drama and Gagaku court music of Japan were the inspiration for the trilogy of church parables Britten composed in the 1960s. The precise nature of these influences is discussed; Britten's sporadic borrowingsfrom Indian music are also fully analysed. There is a survey of critical response to Britten's cross-cultural experiments.Accompanying CD of original Balinese, Japanese and Indian recordings used by Britten as source material.	1998	Boydell Press						ZZZ000000
9781580460392	Conscience and allegiance in seventeenth century England,the political significance of oaths and engagements	David Martin Jones		During the Stuart monarchy oath taking became a means to enforce popular allegiance to the king (who had become head of both the church and the state during the previous Tudor reign). In an age increasingly preoccupied by conscience, this initially helped to strengthen the monarch's power. Yet, paradoxically, religiously and constitutionally motivated groups strongly objected to such state oaths, and the attempt by the crown to enforce such unconditional allegiance served to create a countervailing tradition that opposed it. This book discusses both the attraction of the state oath to government as a devise to promote and secure support, and the reasons why conscience declined in political relevance in the course of the eighteenth century.	1999	University of Rochester Press						ZZZ000000
9781580461399	The power of African cultures	Toyin Falola		This book focuses on the modern cultures of Africa, from the consequences of the imposition of Western rule to the current struggles to define national identities in the context of neo-liberal economic policies and globalization. The book argues that it is against the backdrop of foreign influences that Africa has defined for itself notions of identity and development. African cultures have been evolving in response to change, and in other ways solidly rooted in a shared past. The book successfully deconstructs the last one hundred and fifty years of cultures that have been disrupted, replaced and resurrected. The Power of African Cultures challenges many preconceived notions, such as male dominance and female submission, the supposed unity of ethnic groups, and contemporary Western stereotypes of Africans.The book shows the dynamism of African cultures to adapt to foreign imposition. Even as colonial rule forced the adoption of foreign institutions and cultures, African cultures appropriated these elements. Traditions were reworked, symbols redefined, and the past situated in contemporary problems in order to accommodate the modern era.The book illustrates the intersection between culture and politics in history and in the present. An ongoing dialogue exists between the upholding of traditional African culture and the imposition of a modern culture, and the identity of a people and their relationships to each other and the outside world are at stake. All societies deal with the ambiguity and tensions of maintaining an old world in the face of new developments, but Africans have had to come to terms with an ambiguous identity, as new nation states, institutions, religions, languages and gender roles established themselves on old traditions and understandings of the world.Toyin Falola is the Frances Higginbothom Nalle Centennial Professor in History at the University of Texas at Austin, and author of Nationalism and African Intellectuals and Violence in Nigeria, both from the University o	2003	University of Rochester Press						ZZZ000000

9780750671859	Developing knowledge-based client relationships,the future of professional services	Ross Dawson		The publication of this book heralds a new field of management, thought and practice. The advocates of the 'knowledge economy' have to date focused almost exclusively on how managers can increase the internal productivity of their knowledge assets and intellectual capital. The important next step is understanding that a large and rapidly increasing proportion of the value of business transactions is in knowledge itself. Once this is recognized, managers must devote their attention to how to maximize the value of that knowledge to customers, and tie that directly to developing enduring and profitable relationships.Developing Knowledge-Based Client Relationships guides the reader to understanding the increasing importance of information and knowledge in business transactions and client relationships. It then goes on to present in an extremely practical fashion what knowledge organizations can do to enhance the value of the knowledge the deliver to clients and use that to develop profitable relationships. This is done by presenting underlying theoretical framework, a variety of tools for structuring relationships and presenting knowledge to clients, and numerous case studies and examples of firms which have implemented these concepts	2000	Elsevier						ZZZ000000

9780750648639	Managing downside risk in financial markets,theory, practice and implementation	Frank Alphonse Sortino&Stephen Satchell		Quantitative methods have revolutionized the area of trading, regulation, risk management, portfolio construction, asset pricing and treasury activities, and governmental activity such as central banking to name but some of the applications. Downside-risk, as a quantitative method, is an accurate measurement of investment risk, because it captures the risk of not accomplishing the investor's goal.'Downside Risk in Financial Markets' demonstrates how downside-risk can produce better results in performance measurement and asset allocation than variance modelling. Theory, as well as the practical issues involved in its implementation, is covered and the arguments put forward emphatically show the superiority of downside risk models to variance models in terms of risk measurement and decision making. Variance considers all uncertainty to be risky. Downside-risk only considers returns below that needed to accomplish the investor's goal, to be risky.Risk is one of the biggest issues facing the financial markets today. 'Downside Risk in Financial Markets' outlines the major issues for Investment Managers and focuses on "downside-risk" as a key activity in managing risk in investment/portfolio management. Managing risk is now THE paramount topic within the financial sector and recurring losses through the 1990s has shocked financial institutions into placing much greater emphasis on risk management and control.Free Software Enclosed To help you implement the knowledge you will gain from reading this book, a CD is enclosed that contains free software programs that were previously only available to institutional investors under special licensing agreement to The pension Research Institute. This is our contribution to the advancement of professionalism in portfolio management.The Forsey-Sortino model is an executable program that:1. Runs on any PC without the need of any additional software.2. Uses the bootstrap procedure developed by Dr. Bradley Effron at Stanford University to uncover what could have happened, instead of relying only on what did happen in the past. This is the best procedure we know of for describing the nature of uncertainty in financial markets. 3. Fits a three parameter lognormal distribution to the bootstrapped data to allow downside risk to be calculated from a continuous distribution. This improves the efficacy of the downside risk estimates.4. Calculates upside potential and downside risk from monthly returns on any portfolio manager. 5. Calculates upside potential and downside risk from any user defined distribution.Forsey-Sortino Source Code:1. The source code, written in Visual Basic 5.0, is provided for institutional investors who want to add these calculations to their existing financial services. 2. No royalties are required for this source code, providing institutions inform clients of the source of these calculations. A growing number of services are now calculating downside risk in a manner that we are not comfortable with. Therefore, we want investors to know when downside risk and upside potential are calculated in accordance with the methodology described in this book. Riddles Spreadsheet:1. Neil Riddles, former Senior Vice President and Director of Performance Analysis at Templeton Global Advisors, now COO at Hansberger Global Advisors Inc., offers a free spreadsheet in excel format.2. The spreadsheet calculates downside risk and upside potential relative to the returns on an indexBrings together a range of relevant material, not currently available in a single volume sourceProvides practical information on how financial organisations can use downside risk techniques and technological developments to effectively manage risk in their portfolio managementProvides a rigorous theoretical underpinning for the use of downside risk techniques.

9780750649988	New product development,a practical workbook for improving performance	Ian Barclay&Zoe Dann&Philip Holroyd		The successful development, production and commercial launch of a stream of new and/or modified products has become one of the key factors in creating competitive advantage. Rapidly reducing development lead times and product life cycles, coupled with the shift from mass production to mass customisation are all increasing the pressure on product development activities and processes. This is leading companies to adopt a 'right first time' philosophy together with the constant review and improvement of their new product environment.New product development (NPD) performance needs to be constantly measured and action taken to improve current performance. Improvements to NPD activities and processes can be radical or incremental. They can be based on the review of past performance or the comparison of successful and less successful products. Benchmarking against the best practice in other companies can be used to advantage. Intuition also has its place. If you are interested in all or any of these improvement methodologies, this workbook is for you.The workbook provides information and a structured framework that allows a company to tailor NPD performance measurement and improvement methodologies to their particular circumstances. Part I introduces relevant 'theory' relating to NPD trends, strategy and performance evaluation and improvement. Part II covers the practical application of NPD strategy and performance evaluation/improvement using action based flow-charts ('animated' versions of the flow-charts are included on the CD-ROM). Part III covers the use of a structured NPD assessment tool and methodology presented in paper and CD-ROM formats. Relevant case studies and useful contacts and addresses are also included.	2000-11-28	Butterworth-Heinemann						ZZZ000000

9781902505602	Business Process Management,A Rigorous Approach	Martyn A. Ould		Businesses need to constantly adapt to remain competitive and cannot be held back by static IT systems. Riva is a pioneering method for business process management used to design, model, analyse and record. The methods described in the book work on a business level, but they are IT-orientated and willl be invaluable to those who want to improve or design new business processes or organisational structures to identify IT solutions, especially those involving BPM systems, workflow or document management. With its roots in business theory, rather than software development, the Riva method has gained a reputation for addressing the business aspects of processes in a way that is accessible to the everyday user, whilst giving the analyst powerful tools for process understanding, diagnosis and design.	2005-01-25	British Computer Society						ZZZ000000
9781902505664	A pragmatic guide to business process modelling	Jon Holt		Process modelling is an essential part of understanding the complexities and communication issues inherent in any business. However, this process modelling is often naive and overly simplified, leading to inaccurate, inefficient or entirely inappropriate process definitions. Many process modelling approaches consist of a single flow-chart style view that provides a basic representation of logical order and the input and output of each process, but this is, in most cases wholly inadequate. Consider the analogy of a magician performing a card trick - the process is easy to follow but impossible to replicate from the audience's point of view. To replicate such a magic trick it is necessary to understand several different views of the trick, rather than simply looking at it from the audience's point of view. A full understanding will require some degree of domain knowledge concerning magic and sleight-of-hand, and insight into the hidden complexities behind the trick and a knowledge of the mis-communication devices employed by magicians. The challenge, therefore, is in creating an accurate and concise model of a process - a task that is plagued with complexity and difficulty in understanding the often-buried processes and communication trails that exist. Despite the dynamic behaviour of organizations, they can be thought of as operating or behaving as a number of interrelated processes. Purchasing Process Modelling software is often perceived as the starting point to defining business processes, but unless this is underpinned with a solid and complete understanding of how each process works, results will always be inefficient. "A Pragmatic Guide to Business Process Modelling" provides practical advice on how to model business processes effectively, drawn from the author's vast consulting experience. To truly understand how an organization functions, just considering information flow is never enough. The stakeholders involved in the process must be considered, along with the information produced (and the relationships between this information) all of which depends upon a clear understanding of the terminology being employed. Of course, no amount of process modelling will help if the basic reason why the processes is needed - the requirements - are not fully understood. Process modelling must also apply to procedures, standards, work instructions, guidelines as well as the business processes themselves. In turn each of these needs to be analysed, mapped, measured and documented to gain an understanding of the organization in its totality. "A Pragmatic Guide to Business Process Modelling" helps you specify, visualize, and document your business processes, so that you can analyse your future requirements and design solutions that meet them. Jon Holt's approach to business process modelling provides insight and clarity for business people, whilst providing information sufficiently detailed to develop the requirements of any kind of computer information system. "A Pragmatic Guide to Business Process Modelling": covers all aspects of process modelling from process analysis to process documentation; includes examples of processes: standards, work instructions, guidelines and general business procedures; features practical examples and detailed case studies from a variety of industries; and provides practical guidance for directors and managers on business process modelling to improve processes, productivity and profitability. "A Pragmatic Guide to Business Process Modelling" applies visual modelling techniques to process modelling, using the Unified Modelling Language (UML), an ISO standard which is used increasingly by businesses globally. Although many people are using UML for process modelling, most organizations only use a single diagram - namely the activity diagram which shows a flowchart-style view of processes: the input through to output. The techniques in "A Pragmatic Guide to Business Process Modelling" show how to realise far more benefits, by also using other diagrams to give different views of the business, from high level overviews, to the seeing the system form a single user's perspective. Process Modelling has become a core competency for anyone involved in managing or influencing change; whether improving communications, reducing an organization's complexity, managing risk or supporting good corporate governance. But, to model effectively, you need Jon Holt's "A Pragmatic Guide to Business Process Modelling."	2005-04	British Computer Society						ZZZ000000

Thomas		Insect movement is a subject area that has seen many advances in the past 20 years, due to the advent of metapopulation theory, the development of new techniques in molecular biology and genetics and the widespread availability of computers able to cope with more realistic spacial models. There have also been many advances in our knowledge of flight-related physiology and behavior, and dramatic developments in new techniques for studying movement, such as harmonic radar. This book is based on the main papers presented at the Royal Entomological Society's 20th Symposium on this topic, held in September 1999.	2001	CABI						ZZZ000000
9780826477125	Ethics of Sexual Difference	Luce Irigaray		Luce Irigaray offers the strongest feminist reading in the history of philosophy that I know' Judith Butler Luce Irigaray (1932-) is the foremost thinker on sexual difference of our times. She trained as an analyst with the Lacanian Freudian School of Paris and is a prolific and influential author, whose work ranges over philosophy, psychoanalysis, linguistics and social critique. Since the publication of This Sex Which is Not One she has developed her theory that there are significant differences between the language spoken by men and that spoken by women. In An Ethics of Sexual Difference Irigaray speaks out against many feminists by pursuing questions of sexual difference, arguing that all thought and language is gendered and that there can therefore be no neutral thought. Examining major philosophers, such as Plato, Spinoza and Levinas, with a series of meditations on the female experience, she advocates new philosophies through which women can develop a distinctly female space and a "love of self." It is an essential feminist text and a major contribution to our thinking about language. Translated by Carolyn Burke and Gillian C. Gill	2004	Continuum International Publishing Group						ZZZ000000

Winter&Martin Luther		Desiderius Eramsus (1466/9-1536) was the most renowned scholar of his age, a celebrated humanist and Classicist, and the first teacher of Greek at Cambridge. An influential figure in the Protestant Reformation, though without ever breaking from the Church himself, he satirised both human folly and the corruption of the Church. Martin Luther (1483-1546) was the founder of the German Reformation. His 95 Theses became a manifesto for reform of the Catholic Church and led to his being tried for heresy. He remained in Germany, Professor of Biblical Exegesis at the University of Wittenburg, until his death, publishing a large number of works, including three major treatises and a translation of the New Testament into German. Comprising Erasmus's The Free Will and Luther's The Bondage of the Will, Discourse on Free Will is a landmark text in the history of Protestantism. Encapsulating the perspective on free will of two of the most important figures in the history of Christianity, it r	2005-04	Continuum International Publishing Group						ZZZ000000

9780826476937	I and Thou	Martin Buber		Martin Buber's I and Thou has long been acclaimed as a classic. Many prominent writers have acknowledged its influence on their work; students of intellectual history consider it a landmark; and the generation born since World War II considers Buber as one of its prophets.The need for a new English translation has been felt for many years. The old version was marred by many inaccuracies and misunderstandings, and its recurrent use of the archaic "thou" was seriously misleading. Now Professor Walter Kaufmann, a distinguished writer and philosopher in his own right who was close to Buber, has retranslated the work at the request of Buber's family. He has added a wealth of informative footnotes to clarify obscurities and bring the reader closer to the original, and he has written a long "Prologue" that opens up new perspectives on the book and on Buber's thought. This volume should provide a new basis for all future discussions of Buber.	2004-12	Continuum International Publishing Group						ZZZ000000

9781844836659	Crusades	Thomas F. Madden		The Crusades were a centuries-long series of military campaigns in a violent struggle between the Christian and Islamic worlds. Such wars were fought not only against Islamic empires in Asia Minor, the Holy Land and throughout the Mediterranean region, but also within Europe against heretics, pagans and opponents of the Church. Crusades traces these major expeditions and focuses on key episodes such as the titanic struggles over Jerusalem and Constantinople. War, however, is not the whole story: the encounter between East and West opened the eyes of Europeans to the world outside, stimulating trade and the exchange of ideas. The legacy of the Crusades is most evident today in castles, churches and Moorish architecture, but more surprising is its contribution to developments in areas such as banking, science, engineering, medicine and philosophy. With an authoritative and accessible text by a team of specialist historians, this book not only provides a narrative of the major crusades but also looks at the complex background to events, including the divisions within the major religions - Latin and Orthodox Christians, Shia and Sunni Muslims.	2008-09-15	Duncan Baird Publishers						HIS037010

9781844833078	The secret language of the Renaissance,decoding the hidden symbolism of Italian art	Richard Stemp		Renaissance artists had a habit of encoding meanings into symbols - everything from bee-hives to centaurs. The Secret Language of the Renaissance arms the reader with inside knowledge of the work of the great masters that would have been obvious to people of the time, but these insights have become lost to us. Sometimes these meanings in paintings, sculptures, buildings and literature drew upon a traditional symbolic repertoire but often a more esoteric meaning was encoded - perhaps even a hidden political message or an expression of heretical faith. The Secret Language of the Renaissance gives us the tools by which we can all interpret the layers of significance below the surface of Renaissance art. This is a theme-by-theme guide to the symbolism with a wealth of examples, especially of paintings. Each major work is shown in all its glory and then, by an ingenious design device, de-constructed - or decoded - to interpret the symbols it contains. By shining a light on the use of colour to communicate different messages, the use of perspective and a familiarity with some key tools, the reader can unearth these centuries-lost hidden messages. For all those who relish secret symbolism and conspiracies as well as lovers of the art of Renaissance Italy, this book will instruct and delight in equal measure.	2006-11-02	Duncan Baird						ZZZ000000

9781844071920	Capitalism as if the world matters	Jonathon Porritt		* "Too many environmentalists see capitalism as the enemy. Porritt grapples with its reality--a system capable of delivering sustainability and enhancing wellbeing, but only if we think carefully about what form of capitalism we want. This book stimulates that thinking." Adair Turner * "Here's a compelling book that should sound the trumpet for a whole new generation of engaged and optimistic young people, establishing once and for all that we still have choices--we don't have to sleepwalk our way into the future." David Puttnam * Tackles the most pressing problem of our time--how capitalism, and business, can provide a future of wealth, equity, and ecological integrity * Destined to be one of the most important business, economics, and politics books of the year * Jonathon Porritt, Co-Founder of Forum for the Future, is a leading influence on business and industry, the UK government's premier adviser on sustainable development, and a well-known author, broadcaster, and visionary As our great economic machine grinds relentlessly forward into a future of declining fossil fuel supplies, climate change, and ecosystem failure, humanity, by necessity, is beginning to question the very structure of the economy that has provided so much wealth and inequity across the world. In this fresh, politically charged analysis, Jonathon Porritt weighs in on the most pressing question of the 21st century - can capitalism, as the only real economic game in town, be retooled to deliver a sustainable future? Porritt argues that indeed it can and it must as he lays out the framework for a new "sustainable capitalism" that cuts across the political divide and promises a prosperous future of wealth, equity, and ecosystem integrity.	2005	Earthscan						ZZZ000000
9781853838217	Climate change and power,economic instruments for European electricity	Christiaan Vrolijk&Sustainable Development Programme (Royal Institute of International Affairs)		The electricity sector is one of the largest carbon emitters in Europe. To control these emissions, economic instruments such as emissions trading, taxes and various voluntary agreements are increasingly being considered. However, electricity systems in Europe are diverse between different countries, appropriate policies may differ widely, and similar instruments may have different effects in different countries.This study aims first to define the various economic policy instruments being used or considered in the electricity sector, including the point of application and protection measures such as border adjustments. Secondly, it describes the main characteristics of the major European electricity sectors, including the different generation mixes and options, and divergent policy cultures. Thirdly, conclusions are drawn concerning the instruments likely to be developed, both on national and EU level, their potential impact, and the potential interactions of different instruments within and between countries, including issues relating to international electricity and emissions trading.	2002	Earthscan						ZZZ000000
9781853835650	Creating a new consensus on population,the International Conference on Population and Development	Jyoti Shankar Singh		In 1994, the world's governments agreed, for the first time, far-reaching and enlightened population policies at the International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) in Cairo. The Conference itself, and the many preparatory activities that took place from 1991 to 1994, were characterized by intense, and sometimes acrimonious, debate on the politics of population and development, reproductive health and rights, religion, contraception, and the empowerment of women. This volume examines the entire ICPD process: in particular, how the various stakeholders (governments, NGOs, academics, religious leaders, politicians and the media) addressed the relevant policy issues, and how a new global consensus was forged, resulting in the ICPD Program of Action. Written from the vantage of a crucial insider by Jyoti Shankar Singh, the ICPD Executive Coordinator, this is the definitive account of the Cairo process and its outcome.	1998	Earthscan						ZZZ000000

9781873936894	Photovoltaics in cold climates	Michael Ross&Jimmy Royer&IEA Photovoltaic Power Systems Programme		Providing electric power to remote, cold regions at high latitude or altitude can be an expensive and technically challenging task. Photovoltaics (PV) provide a reliable and cost-effective solution yet their potential is underdeveloped, in part because of a lack of knowledge about their effectiveness in cold climates. This book illustrates the potential and the techniques for using PV in cold climates. The book starts with a general section illustrating how PV can be applied in cold climates, with a succinct overview of the main considerations and chapters covering both the solar resource and the economics. It then covers the effects of cold climates on PV systems looking at the issues around the array and electronics, the battery and energy management. The third section covers design considerations and possible configurations (stand alone/battery systems, hybrid systems, seasonal storage and system simulation). The next part covers installation and operation and the book concludes with several case studies. The book will be invaluable both for all managers charged with providing power to cold climates whether for dwellings, other buildings or technical installations and for all technicians, engineers, installers and researchers working on such installations. It will also be of great interest to those working with PV in any form, or interested to see PV technology reach its full potential.	1999	James & James						ZZZ000000
9781844073290	The polycentric metropolis,learning from mega-city regions in Europe	Peter Geoffrey Hall&Kathy Pain		A new 21st-century urban phenomenon is emerging: the networked polycentric mega-city-region. Developed around one or more cities of global status, it is characterized by a cluster of cities and towns, physically separate but intensively networked in a complex spatial division of labor. This book, the outcome of a major international research program, describes and analyzes eight such regions: South East England, the Bassin Parisien, Central Belgium, the Dutch Randstad, RhineRuhr, Rhine-Main, Northern Switzerland, and Greater Dublin. For the first time, this work shows how businesses interrelate and communicate in geographical space - within each region, between them, and with the wider world. It goes on to demonstrate the profound consequences for spatial planning and regional development in Europe - and, by implication, other similar urban regions of the world. Arranged in five parts, the book introduces the concept of a megacity region, analyzes its characteristics, examines the issues surrounding regional identities, and discusses policy ramifications and outcomes for infrastructure, transport systems, and regulation. Packed with high quality maps and case study data, and written in a clear style by highly experienced authors, this will be an insightful and significant analysis suitable for professionals in urban planning and policy, business and investment communities, technical libraries, and students in urban studies, geography, economics, and planning. The book includes contributions from partners based in each case study area.	2006	Earthscan						ZZZ000000
9781853837708	Risk, uncertainty, and rational action	Carlo Jaeger		Risk as we now know it is a wholly new phenomenon, the by-product of our ever more complex and powerful technologies. In business, policy making, and in everyday life, it demands a new way of looking at technological and environmental uncertainty. In this definitive volume, four of the world's leading risk researchers present a fundamental critique of the prevailing approaches to understanding and managing risk--the "rational actor paradigm." They show how risk studies must incorporate the competing interests, values, and rationalities of those involved and find a balance of trust and acceptable risk. Their work points to a comprehensive and significant new theory of risk and uncertainty and of the decision making process they require. The implications for social, political, and environmental theory and practice are enormous.

9781845429409	Corporate governance in banking,a global perspective	Benton E. Gup		'While corporate governance in general has received considerable attention from economists in recent years, governance of banks specifically has received relatively little. Yet this is an important area both because banking is a large and important sector and because it is highly regulated so that the stakeholders and directors must share their governance authority with government regulators. This volume helps fill the gap. The 13 chapters, primarily by economists from a number of different countries, analyze governance in banking in both the US and other countries. Thus the reader can evaluate both the quality and effectiveness of bank governance across different economic environments. This makes the volume highly valuable to corporate investors and managers as well as researchers and government policymakers.' - George Kaufman, Loyola University, US Recent corporate scandals, together with the effects of globalization, have led to an increasing interest in corporate governance issues. Little attention has been paid, however, to international laws and recommendations dealing with corporate governance in banking from a global perspective. This impressive international set of expert contributors - academics, practitioners and regulators - remedies the lack of attention by examining the various issues and concerns of this important topic. The regulation of corporate banking and accounting is increasingly promoted through various international bodies. Against this background, the contributors explore such aspects of corporate governance as: bank regulation and activity expansion in the US, board structure, community banks, the Enron and WorldCom corporate governance failures, a survey of characteristics of the top 100 world banks, as well as case studies of Australian, German and Hungarian banks. Scholars, regulators, and those on the boards of financial institutions will find the analysis of this understudied area of great interest.	2007	Edward Elgar Publishing						ZZZ000000

9780313273315	Origins of Muslim consciousness in India,a world-system perspective	Syed Nesar Ahmad		The debate over the underlying causes of the clash between Hindus and Muslims which continues to polarize India is the central concern of this volume. Syed Nesar Ahmad challenges popular viewpoints regarding the Hindu-Muslim conflict by asserting that, although instrinsic differences between the two cultures do exist and this schism has been somewhat fueled by the cultural conditions in colonial India, the emergence and growth of the conflict is primarily the result of social and economic forces, both global and regional, that has caused the initial differences to intensify into cultural rift. Ahmad presents a thorough account of Indian history during the 19th and 20th centuries, analyzing how the relationship between Hindus and Muslims has been shaped by each significant political and social development. Evidence of both selectivism and assimilation between Hindus and Muslims, a concept not previously accepted, is apparent throughout the history, and the issue of the origins of the identity of the Muslim consciousness which now exerts such influence in the region is explained in terms of the interaction of religious, social, cultural, and global factors. By viewing India's struggle for its post-colonial identity from this comprehensive historical perspective, this work illuminates some of the fundamental causes of similar conflicts throughout the former colonial world.	1991	Greenwood Publishing Group						ZZZ000000

9780340846797	GOAL formative assessment in science test booklet	GOAL plc		GOAL Formative Assessment helps the class teacher to monitor both individual and class progress while also yielding diagnostic feedback that supports effective teaching, learning and target setting. As such, it provides effective assessment that impacts directly on ongoing teaching ndash; plus a standardised basis for monitoring across the core curriculum (Literacy, Maths, Science and ICT). The tests are especially suitable for use with mixed-ability groups: they allow all pupils to show their strengths, yet motivate lower-ability children with confidence-building success. Attractively presented, pupil-friendly and quick to score, each test is easy to administer to a whole class and only takes about 45 minutes. The Key Stage 3 Science test covers national curriculum levels 2ndash;7 and is carefully matched to the Programme of Study and scheme of work. The low entry-point makes the test especially useful for screening on entry to secondary school, identifying those pupils for whom 'catch-up' provision needs to be made, and giving a convenient check on Key Stage 2 attainments. The test makes for easy progress monitoring, and can also help to focus revision as end-of-Key-Stage tests approach. For each pupil, the test gives a national curriculum level (subdivided andash;c), plus a standardised score and percentile. It also provides diagnostic profiles which pinpoint problem areas and individual strengths and weaknesses (by attainment target), and the broader skills of knowledge and understanding, problem-solving and evaluation and analysis. The Key Stage 3 test booklet is reusable, with a separate answer sheet; separate scoring keys (acetate overlays) allow rapid marking and easy profiling.	2002-03-01	Hodder & Stoughton Educational						ZZZ000000

9781584794370	Heal Your Heart with Wine and Chocolate,...and 99 Other Ways Women Can Protect Their Hearts	Debora Yost&Nancy Loving		Foreword by Nancy Loving, President and Founder, National Coalition for Women with Heart Disease In affairs of the heart, they say, women are the last to know. The same can be said for diseases of the heart. In fact, this year 500,000 women will find this out the hard way: They'll have a heart attack. Less than 40 percent of American women realize that heart disease is their No. 1 health threat, killing twice as many women a year as all cancers combined. Even fewer realize that it is almost totally preventable. In fact, women can reduce their risk of getting heart disease by as much as 84 percent by making simple lifestyle changes-like eating a little chocolate and having a glass of wine each day. In "Heal Your Heart with Wine and Chocolate" veteran health journalist Debora Yost shows that these and 99 other easy-to-do heart-healthy practices for women do not have to be a series of life-altering "have-nots." Rather, they are "must-haves" that are mostly pleasurable and definitely lifeenhancing.,Each how-to tip-from food and activity choices to relaxation methods and relationship strategies-is based on medical research that shows a measurable benefit in women.	2005-12-01	Stewart, Tabori & Chang						ZZZ000000

9781850437109	Cradle of Islam,the Hijaz and the quest for an Arabian identity	Mai Yamani		In 1932, the Al Saud family officially incorporated the Kingdom of the Hijaz into the new Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The Hijazis became a people without a country of their own. Cradle of Islam focuses on contemporary Hijazi life and culture made subservient to the dominant national rules of Saudi Arabia, as dictated by a political and religious elite rooted in the central Najd region of the country. But centralisation was not enough to assimilate or tame Saudi Arabia's distinct regional cultures. The Al Saud family could rule but not fully integrate. This book is an insider's account of the hidden world of the Hijazis including their rituals which have helped to preserve Hijazi identity until now.	2004	I.B.Tauris						ZZZ000000

9781860648311	Florence,a city with a view	Mario Sabbieti&Ilka Singelmann Guaraldi&Auro Lecci		"Florence""A city with a view" No visitors to Florence will ever forget their first view from the surrounding hills of the city's roofs and domes. From a distance, this extraordinary panorama exerts its influence, but it is in the winding streets of the old city centre-- with its bustling life, its varied sights, sounds and smells-- that Florence excites the senses in a way like no other place on earth. Italy is home to a vast quantity of the world's cultural treasures, and Florence itself is rich in medieval and Renaissance artefacts, both artistic and architectural. This book guides the first-time visitor through this cultural treasure trove, and sheds light on the beauty and importance of the masterpieces on display. For those familiar with Florence, the volume shows an unfamiliar face of an old friend, presenting some of the city's famous monuments and palaces in a new and distinctive manner, with a blend of stunning photography and a focus on the hidden, everyday details that somehow capture the very spirit of the place. The result is a vivid, living portrait of this unique and ancient city. Mario Sabbieti was born in Florence, where he now lives. He has written and published two novels for young people, set in Florence during the Resistance and in the days of the 1966 flood, as well as the text for "Florence from the Air" (Weidenfeld & Nicolson). Ilka Singelmann Guaraldi was born in Germany and now lives in Florence. She studied painting and stage design at the Brera Academy of Fine Arts in Milan. She has worked in radio and television, and been responsible for films and documentaries in both Italy and abroad. Auro Lecci studied architecture and visual arts in Florence and the United States. He worked as an artist in the 1960s and 70s and exhibited extensively in galleries and museums. He was amongst the first to work in computer graphics and exhibited at the show devoted to this at the Venice Biennale in 1970.	2002-09-03	Tauris Parke Paperbacks						ZZZ000000
9781860648779	The Great Belzoni,The Circus Strongman Who Discovered Egypt's Ancient Treasures	Stanley Mayes		Eminent historian Stanley Mayes chronicles the truly extra-ordinary life of Giovanni Belzoni: engineer, barber, monk, actor, and strongman in a circus (where he earned his title 'The Great Belzoni'). He is perhaps the most important and yet least-remembered explorer and archaeologist of the last two hundred years. Under near-impossible conditions, Belzoni transported the colossal granite head of Rameses II from Thebes to England, where it remains one of the great treasures of the British Museum. He went on to excavate the great temple of Abu Simbel, discover six major royal tombs in the Valley of the Kings, and provide the British Museum with a spectacular collection of Egyptian antiquities. Belzoni was the first person to penetrate the heart of the second pyramid at Giza, the first European to visit the oasis of Siwah, and the first to discover the ruined city of Berenice on the Red Sea. In 1823, at the age of forty-five, Belzoni died of fever trying to reach the mysterious city of Timbuktu. This treasure of a book tells all of his amazing stories.	2003-07	Tauris Parke Paperbacks						ZZZ000000
9781860643118	Hong Kong,appointment with China	Steve Yui-Sang Tsang		Hong Kong faces the greatest challenge in its history as it returns to Chinese rule in 1997. How will it be affected by the pressures of the hand over period, and what lessons can be drawn from its relations with China and its other neighbors in recent years? Hong Kong has survived crises in the past, most notably after the Japanese takeover in 1941. In the course of the Pacific War it came under the Allied Theater for which the nationalist Chinese leader Chiang Kai shek was Supreme Commander, and in 1945 its future as a British colony was seriouly threatened. Although Hong Kong did ultimately return to British rule, an appointment was made with China for the year 1997. Hong Kong was to rejoin mother China. Despite the assurances of business leaders and politicians--from both East and West--that no radical changes are planned, doubts remain over the course that has been mapped out for Hong Kong in the next millennium. Hong Kong: An Appointment with China provides a much needed introduction for the general reader to the background and implications of this historic hand over, including the problems which have threatened the process--particularly the impact of the Tiananmen massacre and disputes over democratization.	1997	I.B.

9789186884123	Interaction and isolation in late Byzantine culture,papers read at a colloquium held at the Swedish Research Institute in Istanbul, 1-5 December, 1999	Jan Olof Rosenqvist		Confined to the restricted area within the city walls of Constantinople, Byzantium of the Palaiologan period (1261-1453) realized impressive cultural achievements. The so-called "renaissance" was short-lived and lacked a sustainable foundation, but it inspired new developments even in areas outside Byzantium proper. Western Europe became a new source of inspiration, while the influence of antiquity now proved particularly powerful. Aspects of art, literature, philosophy, archaeology and music are all discussed by the contributors to this comprehensive account of an important and influential period of Byzantine history.

9781845114305	Occupied territories,the untold story of Israel's settlements	Gershom Gorenberg		Gershom Gorenberg is a writer and journalist living in Jerusalem. He has written for The New York TimesMagazine, The Washington Post and the Israeli daily, Ha'aretz.In the fog of the 1967 war and its aftermath, Israel's generals and politicians took a series of fateful decisions that led to a bloody, bitter and seemingly endless occupation of Arab lands. Gershom Gorenberg takes us behind the scenes of history to glimpse those decisions being made. He reveals for the first time the motivation, influences and strategies of key players such as Yigal Allon, Moshe Dayan and Golda Meir. He shows how Labour politicians allowed themselves to be persuaded by a mixture of political convenience, military alarmism and religious fanaticism in to allowing settlements to develop in the occupied territories, despite being fully aware that this contravened international law. Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's eviction of Jewish settlers from Gaza in 2004 has shown that it is possible for the Israeli government to confront the settler movement. and further evacuations have been mooted. But the issue is a divisive one: all the passions,ambitions and political alliances which gave rise to Israel's pursuit of 'The Whole Land', from the Mediterranean to the Jordan Valley, remain potent forces. Gorenberg's book is essential reading for anyone seeking to understand not only the occupation, but the mindset of the occupiers????ISBNGershom Gorenberg is a writer and journalist living in Jerusalem.

9781845119737	Opium,uncovering the politics of the poppy	Pierre-Arnaud Chouvy		Bitter, brownish and sticky, opium - the sap of the opium poppy, Papaver somniferum - has been cultivated from the earliest of times. Known to the Greeks as opos or opion, as afiun in Persian and Arabic, and Fu-yung in Chinese, it is a substance that is at once both a palliative and a poison. Its exotic origins, its literary associations and the properties that were frequently, if erroneously, attributed to it have ensured the continuing air of mystery that has long surrounded it. In 'Opium', Pierre-Arnaud Chouvy reveals the fascinating history of this powerful and addictive drug and its long association with civilisation down the centuries. He explores the changing fortunes of the modern day trade in illicit opium, especially in the remote and inaccessible regions of Asia known as the Golden Triangle and Golden Crescent, the major opium-producing areas of the world today. He reveals how, when and why illicit opium production emerged, what sustains it, and why a century of global measures has failed to eradicate it. The result is a compelling account of our continuing fascination with a narcotic as old as humanity itself and a powerful insight into the complexities and difficulties of the politics and economics of the poppy in Asia and the world today.	2009-08-30	I.

9781850434207	Out of evil,new international politics and old doctrines of war	Stephen Chan		The `Axis of Evil', following hard on the heels of `The Evil Empire', has institutionalized a new rhetoric of morality in international affairs which, at least in appearance, mirrors the ideological aspirations of George W. Bush and his neo-Conservative policy advisors (Out of evil can come great good said the President shortly after 9/11). But what is this notion of `evil' which has become part of the language of international politics? What are its moral, legal and political foundations? Is the fight against evil merely a new form of imperialism? This book makes an essential contribution towards a better understanding of how international politics works in the contemporary world by demonstrating how moralizing, rhetoric and sloganeering have embedded themselves in the language of diplomacy.	2005	I.B.Tauris						ZZZ000000
9781860645662	A passion for Egypt,Arthur Weigall, Tutankhamun, and the "curse of the pharaohs"	Julie Hankey		This compelling biography of Arthur Weigall, the British Egyptologist and Chief Inspector of Antiquities, chronicles his involvement with the discovery of Tutankhamun's tomb under Howard Carter and Lord Carnarvon. Weigall came into conflict with Carter and Carnarvon over newspaper reporting of the famous find. His remarks to the press during that time led to the infamous story of the "Curse of the Pharaohs." This biography brings to life the atmosphere, intrigue, and intense competition in Egypt during the first quarter of the 20th century.	2001	I.B. Tauris						ZZZ000000
9781860648328	Pharaoh's people,scenes from life in imperial Egypt	Thomas Garnet Henry James		Popular interest in ancient Egypt has too often tended to focus on the deeds of rulers, great nobles, and priests. In Pharaoh's People , T.G.H. James by contrast examines the daily working lives of Egyptians lower down the social scale: bureaucrats, scribes, craftsmen, and workers of the land. James has drawn on the evidence of paintings and inscriptions from tombs and temples, from official archives, private correspondence, accounts, and dispatches. Most of the texts have been newly translated for this book and, in examining them, the author brings to life the fascinating intricacies of daily life under the Pharaohs.	2002-12-31	Tauris Parke						ZZZ000000
9781850434245	The price of fear,al-Qaeda and the truth behind the financial war on terror	Ibrahim Warde		Finance has taken centre stage since 9/11 and the waging of 'the War on Terror'. But despite extensive media coverage the war on this financial front remains little understood. Ibrahim Warde's book thus fills an enormous and important gap. It traces the origins of the well-tried money laundering template and discusses the laws, rules and regulations designed to combat its effectiveness. In the process he reveals the faulty assumption which has formed the basis of the financial war on terror: that al-Qaeda and other related terrorist groups were comparable to drug lords and other international gangsters. The tracking of clean money being 'soiled' for illicit purposes requires different intelligence and law enforcement approaches from monitoring dirty money being laundered. This highly topical and original book will appeal to a broad range of readers interested in public affairs and to a significant range of academics interested in finance and economics, business administration, international relations, political science, security studies and Middle Eastern studies.	2007	I.B.Tauris						ZZZ000000
9781850439035	Resurrecting empire,western footprints and America's perilous path in the Middle East	Rashid Khalidi		Rashid Khalidi's powerful new book examines the record of Western involvement in the Middle East and analyzes the likely outcomes of the USA's most recent incursions in the region. Begun as the United States and Britain moved their forces into Iraq, and fully up-to-date to cover the shocking revelations of abuse of Iraqi prisoners and the debate over intelligence failures and the war's legitimacy, Khalidi paints a chilling scenario of the present situation. America's path of conflict, occupation and colonial rule, which has exacerbated the instability in the Middle East is an object reminder that a policy based on flawed intelligence and a determined, inflexible world view carries the seeds of failure.	2004-08-27	I.B.Tauris						ZZZ000000
9789186884130	The Role of the State in West Asia	Annika Rabo&Bo Utas		West and Central Asia have for centuries contributed to shaping the identity of Europe by constituting a significant other. This work looks at social, cultural and political areas of heritage and cross-cultural interaction. The region itself may be defined as one that stretches from the Mediterranean to China, and from the Himalayas to Siberia, but this study focuses on Iran, Iraq, Syria and Turkey.	2005	Swedish Research Institute in Istanbul						ZZZ000000
9781850439455	Temples of Ancient Egypt	Byron E. Shafer&Dieter Arnold		This book presents an important survey of ancient Egyptian temples and the rituals associated with their use. It covers the entire pharaonic era, from the Old Kingdom to the Roman period, and offers a fresh perspective on ritual and its cultural significance, demonstrating the role of temples as loci for the creative interplay of sacred space and sacred time. Temples of Ancient Egypt challenges the traditional division of temples into the categories of either 'mortuary' or 'divine', showing that their functions and symbolic representations were, at once, too varied and too intertwined.	2005-05-27	I.B.Tauris						ZZZ000000
9781845110895	Understanding architecture	Marco Bussagli		"This comprehensive book is both a celebration and an exploration of the architecture from all periods throughout the world. It traces the history of humankind through the buildings that people have created - their places of work and worship, their dwellings and their centres of study. The first section of analyses: the concept of space, the study of proportion, town planning, types of building and styles. The second section traces the birth of architecture from the first grand examples, such as the Great Wall of China, the Pyramids and the Renaissance churches to the innovations of the modern era. It pays particular attention to the great architects themselves - from the great medieval master builders of the West and the Islamic worlds to the iconic moderns - Frank Lloyd Wright, Le Corbusier, Robert Venturi and Frank Gehry. It frames contemporary architecture with reference to the pioneering work of Norman Foster, Zaha Hadid and Richard Rogers. Understanding Architecture is an essential reference for all students and practitioners as well as a rewarding information source."--BOOK JACKET.	2005-01-01	I.B.Tauris						ZZZ000000
9781860649028	The working class in Britain, 1850-1939	John Benson		The first generation of postwar British labor historians tended to be preoccupied with working class activism. The history of the working class concentrated on trade unions, left-wing politics, parties, and activists. This book attempts to chart not only this struggle, but to describe and analyze the rich and varied tapestry of working class history as a whole. John Benson examines work, wages, incomes, and the cost of living; family, kinship, and community relations; the individual in the context of nation and class; and the labor movement in all its aspects.	2003	I.B.Tauris						ZZZ000000
9780881322552	Economic integration of the Korean Peninsula	Marcus Noland&Institute for International Economics (U.S.)		The North Korean economy cannot sustain its population. Absent fundamental economic reforms, it will never be able to do so. Hence, North Korea will require sizable external support for the foreseeable future. South Korea, China, Japan & the United States have been willing to provide this support because they fear a collapse in the North, or even worse, a lashing out that would unleash war on the peninsula & put millions of people in Asia in jeopardy - including thousands of US troops stationed in South Korea & Japan.The status quo is thus closer to extortion than charity. In this volume, a diverse group of contributors analyze prospective developments on the Korean peninsula. The authors address the three broad strategic possibilities of war, collapse & gradual adjustment. Four immediate policy issues are then considered: the current economic conditions & policies in the North, the food crisis, the nuclear energy/nuclear weapons issue & the possibility of large-scale refugee flows. Finally, the volume considers several longer-run issues concerning the inevitable integration of the peninsula: the potential relevance of the German experience, the costs & benefits of economic unification between North & South Korea & the possible role of the international financial institutions in funding the new arrangement. The volume concludes with recommendations for policymakers,especially in the United States & South Korea, from the preceding analyses.	1998-01	Peterson Institute						ZZZ000000
9780881322729	Fighting the wrong enemy,antiglobal activists and multinational enterprises	Edward Montgomery Graham		Antiglobalist forces have been gaining ever greater momentum in recent years in their efforts to reverse what they view as the negative effects of an integrating global economy, with the 1999 WTO meeting in Seattle serving as an example. Their influence was felt earlier when efforts to create a Multilateral Agreement on Investment (MAI) ended in failure in 1998 after France left the bargaining table at the Organization for Economic Cooperation & Development, effectively killing the initiative. In this study, through an evaluation of the MAI itself & the issues raised by its opponents, Edward M. Graham takes a fresh look at the growing backlash against globalization. He first explores whether the MAI negotiations failed due to political maneuvering by antiglobalist nongovernmental organizations (supported by US organized labor) or because of irreconcilable differences among the negotiating parties over the substance of the issue of foreign direct investment. He then objectively & thoroughly assesses antiglobalist assertions that the activities of multinational firms have had negative effects on workers both in the home (investor) & host (recipient) nations, with a special focus on developing nations. An important finding is that multinational firms tend to pay workers in developing nations wages that are significantly above generally prevailing wages. Graham then examines the issue of globalized economic activity & the environment, finding that economic growth in developing nations can lead to increased environmental stress but also finding that foreign direct investment can lead to reductions in this stress. On the issue of globalization & the environment, he finds that the worry of many environmentalists of a "race to the bottom" is not borne out by the evidence. The final chapters assess whether or not a negotiation to create a comprehensive agreement on investment should be included in a multilateral negotiating round at the World Trade Organization in the near future. The interests of developing nations in this agenda are given special attention. Graham indicates that, while many developing nations would accept such rules, it might nonetheless be premature to press for a comprehensive agreement at this time. Rather, a limited investment agenda might be both more feasible & more productive. August 2000. 250 pages. ISBN: paper 0-88132-272-5. $18.95.

9780881322040	Foreign direct investment in the United States	Edward Montgomery Graham&Paul R. Krugman		The share of US output held by foreign-controlled firms tripled during the 1980s, but the growth of foreign direct investment (FDI) in the United States fell sharply after 1990. Graham and Krugman provided the first analysis of the growth of this investment, and its economic and national security implications, in the first and second editions. The third, extensively revised edition analyzes the post-1990 downturn in FDI, updates all statistics, provides new analysis based on statistical series not previously available, and assesses recent legislative proposals to restrict FDI.	1995	Peterson Institute						ZZZ000000
9781853396038	Bridging research and policy in development,evidence and the change process	Julius Court&Ingie Hovland&John Young		* Explains best practice on conducting an "influencing agenda"* Powerful and wide-ranging case studies* Explores the link between research and policy This is a crucial book for international development researchers who want the lessons of their research converted into changes in government and aid agency policy. International policy making is extremely complex and little studied. This book reviews what we do already know and provides a conceptual framework for future research. Through four case studies, ranging from local to international and from theory to practice, it explores the vital importance of cultures and structures, people, places and timing.International development work attracts some of the most intelligent entrants to the world of public service, young people who want their commitment to the shaping of a better world to be reflected in the policies of the ministries and agencies they have joined. This book will help to explain to those young people, and to their leaders in the international development community, how to bring about the changes in policy that will promote a true pro-poor development, based on the evidence of what works.	2005-02	ITDG						ZZZ000000

9781845110888	Iraq confidential,the untold story of America's intelligence conspiracy	Scott Ritter		"Scott Ritter is the straight-talking former Marine officer whom the CIA wanted to silence. After the 1991 Gulf War Ritter helped lead the UN weapons inspections of Iraq, and found himself at the centre of a dangerous game between the Iraqi and US regimes. As Ritter now reveals in this book, Washington was only ever interested in disarmament as a tool for its own agenda: regime change. Operating in a fog of espionage and counter-espionage, Ritter and his team were determined to find out the truth about Iraq's WMD. The CIA was equally determined to stop them. For the truth, we now know, was that Iraq was playing a deadly game of double-bluff, and actually had no WMD. But to have revealed this would have derailed America's drive to topple Saddam Hussein." "Iraq Confidential charts the disillusionment of a true patriot, who came to realise that his own government sought to undermine weapons control in the Middle East. Ritter shows us a world of deceit and betrayal, in which nothing is as it seems. Ricocheting between trigger-happy Iraqi soldiers in the desert and duplicitous spymasters in Washington, this book provides glimpses into the real workings of international diplomacy - Ritter reveals the truth about Saddam's so-called secret SCUD force, the chief CIA intelligence source 'Curveball', the involvement of the Israelis and the full extent to which the CIA simply commandeered the UN disarmament mission. A host of characters from MI6 to the Romanian intelligence services flesh out this narrative, which will radically affect the ongoing debates about Iraq."--BOOK JACKET.	2005	I.B.Tauris						ZZZ000000

9780471835769	Branding in Asia,the creation, development, and management of Asian brands for the global market	Paul Temporal		"Paul Temporal shows how the fundamental principles of brand building are transferable to the Asian environment. A diverse collection of Asian caselets should convince us that the 21st century will see the emergence of more Asian regional and global megabrands." Professor John A Quelch Dean London Business School "Branding in Asia addresses an unusual situation in Asia - how is it that a region which has such high brand appreciation, produces few international brands of its own? The author's analysis of actual case studies, ranging from powerful global brands to local companies, illustrates his points clearly. This, coupled with a sensitive understanding of the cultural differences in the region makes it an excellent reference for everyone working with brands." Felix Herrnberger President BMW Asia Pte Ltd "Paul Temporal succinctly dissects the often mystical qualities that make up a successful brand. Too often Western insights, models and case studies are applied arbitrarily across the globe, it is so refreshing to see branding tackled from a purely Asian perspective. An invaluable reference book and eminently readable, the step-by-step style and volume of relevant cases and examples makes this a must have for any manager in Asia looking to embark on creating his own regional or global brand."

9781853832987	Acid earth,the politics of acid pollution	John McCormick		Acid rain was the environmental issue of the 1980s, attracting the kinds of headlines which, today, are more often devoted to global warming and threats to the ozone layer. But while industrialized countries have taken measures to reduce the emissions that lead to acid rain, the problems of acidification have not gone away. Trees are still dying; lakes are still being made uninhabitable; buildings are still corroding; and human health is still suffering. The most worrying trend is the repetition in the industrializing countries of Asia and Latin America of the problems that have long afflicted Europe and North America. More than 10 years after it was first published, the highly acclaimed Acid Earth still provides the only global view of acidification, and remains the standard text on the problem. In this third edition'completely updated and extensively revised'the science, politics and economics of acidification are described with a clarity and comprehensiveness available from no other source. Chapters on the causes, effects and growing scientific understanding of acid pollution, and the possible solutions, are followed by detailed studies of the political struggles involved in responding to acid damage in western and eastern Europe, the US, and in the newly industrialising countries. Written for specialists, students and anyone interested in the problems of the environment, Acid Earth warns that the problems have not gone away, and that a renewed sense of public and political will are needed if they are to be brought under control.	1997-10	Earthscan						ZZZ000000

9781853836565	Beyond Malthus,nineteen dimensions of the population challenge	Lester Russell Brown&Gary Gardner&Brian Halweil		On the bicentennial of Malthus' legendary essay on the tendency of population to grow more rapidly than the food supply, this book examines the impacts of population growth on 19 global resources and services, including food, fresh water, fisheries, jobs, education, income and health. Despite current hype of a 'birth dearth' in parts of Europe and Japan, the fact remains that human numbers are projected to increase by over 3 billion by 2050. Populations in rapidly growing nations are in danger of outstripping the carrying capacity of their natural support systems and governments in such situations will find it increasingly hard to respond to crises such as AIDS, food and water shortages and mass unemployment. Beyond Malthus examines methods such as the expansion of international family planning, investment in educating young people in the developing world and promotion of a shift towards smaller families which will represent the most humane response to the possible ravages of the population explosion.	2000	Earthscan						ZZZ000000

Though there have been some improvements little has worked to create real economic and ecological opportunities for the poor. This is because of a failure to place their needs at the centre of action or to link local-level development to urgently needed reforms in national and international development policies. This book has been written to change all of that.Working closely with teams across the globe, Worldwide Fund for Nature (WWF-International), formerly World Wildlife Fund, devised a revolutionary three-level approach to analyzing and intervening to eradicate poverty in all countries. This universal approach helps to develop ways of improving the local environment and community livelihoods as well as identifying and tackling state/provincial, national, and international policy obstacles. Unashamedly critical yet unceasingly practical, this book provides both the tools and successful case studies to show practitioners how to adopt the approach in a variety of international contexts, including integrating it with existing methods, to improve livelihoods and enhance conservation and help the world??'s poor escape poverty??'s grasp.	2006	Earthscan						ZZZ000000
9781853833533	Global action for biodiversity,an international framework for implementing the convention on biological diversity	Timothy M. Swanson&International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources&World Wide Fund for Nature		At the Rio Summit in 1992, the nations of the world adopted the Global Biological Diversity Convention, and 120 countries have since ratified it. At present, however, the convention acts as a framework only, with little in the way of binding language or substantive obligations. The time has come for the international community to develop the institutions and obligations which will give real effect to the aspirations of the convention, and to ensure that the lofty language of the text has some real effect at ground level. This book describes the nature of the issues now before the international community, the gaps in the Convention which remain to be filled, and the ways in which the international community can reach agreement on those gaps. Tim Swanson begins with an overview of the issues. He then develops the basic nature of the problems within a bio-economic framework, presenting the decline of diversity as the result of the development process and its management within the same context. The second part of the book describes the nature of the solutions required to address the problems, and the ways in which they can be adapted within the framework of the convention, with detailed explanations of the concepts involved. The biodiversity convention represents an unprecedented opportunity for the development of institutions and policies which will help foster an alternative path to development. It is an opportunity which should not be wasted	1997	Earthscan						ZZZ000000

9781853837296	Just sustainabilities,development in an unequal world	Julian Agyeman&Robert Doyle Bullard&Bob Evans		Environmental activists and academics alike are realizing that a sustainable society must be a just one. Environmental degradation is almost always linked to questions of human equality and quality of life. Throughout the world, those segments of the population that have the least political power and are the most marginatized are selectively victimized by environmental crises. Just Sustainabilities argues that social and environmental justice within and between nations should be an integral part of the policies and agreements that promote sustainable development. The book addresses many aspects of the links between environmental quality and human equality and between sustainability and environmental justice more generally. The topics discussed include anthropocentrism; biotechnology; bioprospecting; biocultural assimilation; deep and radical ecology; ecological debt; ecological democracy; ecological footprints; ecological modernization; feminism and gender; globalization; participatory research; place, identity, and legal rights; precaution; risk society; selective victimization; and valuation.

She argues that lower fertility rates are preferred by women themselves; are beneficial in their own right to both women and children; and should not be used as a bargaining chip in any other area of the development debate. This is a challenging contribution to the debate. It presents a persuasive case for policies which recognise hopeful trends in relieving the environmental and social pressures of an increasing global population, and portends a better future for those who, to date, have counted for little amongst those who do the counting	1995-06-29	Earthscan						ZZZ000000
9781844071760	Power to the people,how the coming energy revolution will transform an industry, change our lives, and maybe even save the planet	Vijay V. Vaitheeswaran		We live in a 'risk society' where the identification, distribution and management of risks, from new technology, environmental factors or other sources are crucial to our individual and social existence. Jeanne and Roger Kasperson are two of the world's leading and most influential analysts of the social dimensions of risk. "The Social Contours of Risk" brings together in two volumes their most important contributions to this fundamental and wide-ranging field. Volume 1 collects their fundamental work on how risks are communicated among different publics and stakeholders, including local communities, corporations and the larger society. It analyzes the problems of lack of transparency and trust and explores how even minor effects can be amplified and distorted through media and social responses, preventing effective management. The final section investigates the difficult ethical issues raised by the unequal distribution of risk depending on factors such as wealth, location and genetic inheritance -- with examples from worker and public protection, facility siting conflicts, transporting hazardous waste and widespread impacts such as climate change.	2005	Earthscan						ZZZ000000
9781853833250	Striking a balance,a guide to enhancing the effectiveness of non-governmental organisations in international development	Alan Fowler		At a time of rapid global change, non-governmental organizations involved in international development (NGDOs) are confronted with demands to simultaneously increase the scale of their impact, diversify their activities, respond to long-term humanitarian crises and improve their performance. Striking a Balance provides a practical guide to how NGDOs can better respond to these expectations. Written for NGDO leaders, managers, donors, and those with an academic interest, the book summarises the major tasks of sustainable people-centred development, describing five factors which influence effectiveness. These are: suitable organisational design; competent leadership and human resources; appropriate external relationships; mobilisation of high quality finance; and the measurement of performance coupled to 'learning for leverage'. Details are given of the capacities needed in each area and how they can be assessed and improved. Effectiveness calls for NGDOs which retain their non-profit values, establish the right type of professionalism, manage dilemmas and make difficult choices which continually reflect the priorities, rights and needs of those who give them legitimacy: people who are poor and marginalised. This book provides a reference of current and future practices which will help NGDOs to do so.	1997	Earthscan						ZZZ000000

The scenarios are "Market World" - in which market forces and new technology will lead to rising prosperity but greater inequality and insecurity, a future in which markets rule and global corporations dominate; "Fortress World" - a grimmer future in which islands of prosperity are surrounded by oceans of poverty and despair, a future of conflict and violence, social chaos and growing environmental degradation; and "Transformed World" - a future in which fundamental social and political changes offer hope of fulfilling human aspirations.	1998	Earthscan						ZZZ000000

9780749436292	The healthy organization,a revolutionary approach to people & management	Brian Dive		Despite the huge volume of research work covering organizational design by everyone from management gurus, sociologists and behavioral scientists to management and business journalists, most organizations remain profoundly unhealthy. There are a number of reasons for this: poor organizational design, faulty company strategy, unclear links to strategy, poor company culture and unhappy employees, to name a few. In this groundbreaking title, Brian Dive reveals that the unhealthy features of both large and small organizations, whether private or public, voluntary or cooperative, all stem from the same source, namely the lack of true accountability. Brian Dive illustrates that organizations are unhealthy because they lack transparent decision-making accountability. Based on the author's experience gained from working at Unilever for 31 years and, more recently, working for Tesco for 2 years as a consultant, and covering research in over 50 countries, Brian Dive answers the recurring questions that dog an organization's development: * How Many People Should There Be In The Organization? * How Many Layers Of Hierarchy Are Necessary? * How Can You Effectively Reward Employees? * What Are The Logical Steps Of Professional Development For Employees? * What Career Paths Should Individuals Follow? By following the steps outlined by Brian Dive in the book, healthy organizational management will lead to greater competitiveness, spark innovation and increase employee empowerment.

9781588266330	Foreign investment & domestic development,multinationals and the state	Jenny Rebecca Kehl		How is it that, in a time of unprecedented global opulence and market activity, billions of dollars flow through the developing world without altering its reality of poverty and scarcity? Jenny Kehl explores the crucial relationship between foreign direct investment and domestic development, focusing on the wide variation in the capacity of governments to negotiate FDI to the advantage of their citizens.To isolate the influence of political factors, Kehl examines one of the largest foreign investors, General Motors, in its relations with six host countries representing a range of political systems. Her cases, along with her larger statistical study, soundly refute conventional wisdom, demonstrating that the essential elements for successfully using FDI for development are political, not economic, and pointing to the political strategies and institutions that can best maximize the domestic benefits of FDI.	2008-12-31	Lynne Rienner Publishers						ZZZ000000

9780805842968	Human resources for the non-HR manager	Carol T. Kulik		Human Resources for the Non-HR Manager appeals to anyone interested in management issues.

Designed to make the material more accessible and personally relevant, the book includes the following special features: *Manager's Checkpoints--a series of questions that help the reader apply the material to his or her own organizational context; *Boxes that describe real-life examples of how companies respond to HR challenges; *For Further Reading--references to articles published in outlets that bridge the academic-practitioner divide; *Manager's Knots--presented in a question-and-answer format, these describe typical managerial problems, take the reader into some of the gray, ambiguous areas of HR, and suggest ways to apply the chapter material to real-life managerial dilemmas; and *An Instructor's Manual available to instructors who adopt the book for classroom use.	2004-04-30	Lawrence Erlbaum						ZZZ000000
9780805845266	Statistical power analysis,a simple and general model for traditional and modern hypothesis tests	Kevin R. Murphy&Brett Myors		This book presents a simple and general method for conducting statistical power analysis based on the widely used Fstatistic. The book illustrates how these analyses work and how they can be applied to problems of studying design, to evaluate others' research, and to choose the appropriate criterion for defining "statistically significant" outcomes. Statistical Power Analysisexamines the four major applications of power analysis, concentrating on how to determine: *the sample size needed to achieve desired levels of power; *the level of power that is needed in a study; *the size of effect that can be reliably detected by a study; and *sensible criteria for statistical significance. Highlights of the second edition include:a CDwith an easy-to-use statistical power analysis program; a new chapter on power analysis in multi-factor ANOVA,including repeated-measuresdesigns; and a new One-Stop PV Tableto serve as a quick reference guide. The book discusses the application of power analysis to both traditional null hypothesis tests and to minimum-effect testing. It demonstrates how the same basic model applies to both types of testing and explains how some relatively simple procedures allow researchers to ask a series of important questions about their research. Drawing from the behavioral and social sciences, the authors present the material in a nontechnical way so that readers with little expertise in statistical analysis can quickly obtain the values needed to carry out the power analysis. Ideal for students and researchers of statistical and research methodology in the social, behavioral, and health sciences who want to know how to apply methods of power analysis to their research.	2004	Psychology Press						ZZZ000000
9780853231356	Studies in Latin American literature and culture in honour of James Higgins	Stephen M.

9780262134569	Soft cinema,navigating the database	Lev Manovich&Andreas Kratky		What kind of cinema is appropriate for the age of Palm Pilot and Google? Automatic surveillance and self-guided missiles? Consumer profiling and CNN? To investigate this question, Lev Manovich, one of today's most influential thinkers in the fields of media arts and digital culture, paired with award-winning new media artist and designer Andreas Kratky. They have also invited contributions from leaders in other cultural fields: DJ Spooky, Scanner, George Lewis, and Johann Johannsson (music), servo (architecture), Schoenerwissen/OfCD (information visualization), and Ross Cooper Studios (media design).The results of their three-year explorations are the three "films" presented on this DVD. Although the films resemble the familiar genres of cinema, the process by which they were created demonstrates the possibilities of soft(ware) cinema. A "cinema," that is, in which human subjectivity and the variable choices made by custom software combine to create films that can run infinitely without ever exactly repeating the same image sequences, screen layouts and narratives.Mission to Earth, a science fiction allegory of the immigrant experience, adopts the variable choices and multi-frame layout of the Soft Cinema system to represent "variable identity." Absences is a lyrical black and white narrative that relies on algorithms normally deployed in military and civilian surveillance applications to determine the editing of video and audio. Texas, a "database narrative," assembles its visuals, sounds, narratives, and even the identities of its characters, from multiple databases. The DVD was designed so that every viewing of each film generates a different version.	2005	MIT Press						ZZZ000000

9780309089128	Large-scale biomedical science,exploring strategies for future research	Sharyl J. Nass&Bruce Stillman&National Cancer Policy Board (U.S.). Committee on Large-scale Science and Cancer Research		The nature of biomedical research has been evolving in recent years. Technological advances that make it easier to study the vast complexity of biological systems have led to the initiation of projects with a larger scale and scope. In many cases, these large-scale analyses may be the most efficient and effective way to extract functional information from complex biological systems. "Large-Scale Biomedical Science: Exploring Strategies for Future Research looks at the role of these new large-scale projects in the biomedical sciences. Though written by the National Academies' Cancer Policy Board, this book addresses implications of large-scale science extending far beyond cancer research. It also identifies obstacles to the implementation of these projects, and makes recommendations to improve the process. The ultimate goal of biomedical research is to advance knowledge and provide useful innovations to society. Determining the best and most efficient method for accomplishing that goal, however, is a continuing and evolving challenge. The recommendations presented in "Large-Scale Biomedical Science are intended to facilitate a more open, inclusive, and accountable approach to large-scale biomedical research, which in turn will maximize progress in understanding and controlling human disease.	2003-06	National Academies Press						ZZZ000000

9780844229522	Strategic brand communication campaigns	Don E. Schultz&Beth E. Barnes		In the marketplace of the 21st century, the critical form of customer communication will be broader than advertising and promotional messages. Customers have relationships with the brand, combining all the forms of communication that give meaning to products and services. Brand communication creates an interactive relationship between the product or service and consumers, which is a major change in the way advertisers and marketers have traditionally viewed customer communication. Authors Don Schultz and Beth Barnes have built on the foundation of their best-selling text, Strategic Advertising Campaigns, to create a book that embodies this new approach to advertising and marketing communication: Strategic Brand Communication Campaigns. This innovative text focuses on the messages and incentives customers receive, rather than what marketers send out, which differentiates brand communication management from advertising management.

Strategic Brand Communication Campaigns shows students how to produce successful campaigns in the dynamic marketplace of the future.

9780879837884	Women's encyclopedia of natural medicine,alternative therapies and integrative medicine	Tori Hudson&Christiane Northrup		At least one-third of Americans use alternative medicines to heal and maintain health-- 75 percent of those consumers are women. Today, women are demanding their doctors have a willingness to explore and combine complementary and conventional medical practices in their approach to female health. The result is a bridge between the two schools of thought commonly known as integrated medicine, which requires women to become proactive in their role as patient and provides a safe, effective approach to maintaining and healing their bodies. "Women's Encyclopedia of Natural Medicine" thoroughly covers the whole range of women's health concerns including menstrual difficulties, menopause, endometriosis, osteoperosis, and others and explains how integrated medicine can be used to treat these conditions. Dr. Hudson explores a plethora of complementary therapies-- including vitamin supplementation, herbs, diet and exercise-- and helps women decide when self-care is possible and when a conventional doctor should be consulted. Tori Hudson, N.D., has made this resource the definitive guide to integrated women's medicine for the health professional as well as the patient seeking more affordable and safer approaches to both common and complicated female health issues.	1999-04-11	McGraw-Hill Professional						ZZZ000000

9780335201174	Supervision in the helping professions,an individual, group and organizational approach	Peter Hawkins&Robin Shohet		Praise for the first edition of Supervision in the Helping Professions: "The authors of this book really do know their subject well and have organised the presentation in a clear, systematic, readable style, refreshingly devoid of trans-atlantic jargon. It deals with all aspects of supervision and most importantly provides a meaningful blueprint about how useful and effective supervision can be. Let me recommend this book to you without reservation." - Journal of the British Psychodrama Association "The one really powerful book in this area, a book that fundamentally changed the way in which people think about supervision and training." - Professor John McLeod, University of Abertay, Dundee, Scotland "A very readable book which is of immense help to anyone in a mentoring or supervisory relationship. It will appeal equally to educators, managers and students. All nurses will benefit from reading it. It is reasonably priced and well presented. Buy it." - Philip Burnard, Nursing Times "This timely book offers the reader a comprehensive and practical guide to the complex issues inherent in the supervision of health and social services personnel, from the student on field-work placement to the most experienced therapist." - British Journal of Occupational Therapy This is an essential book for supervisors across all the helping professions which explores the purposes, models and different forms of supervision. It also addresses the needs of staff and examines how they can become more able in getting the support and supervision that they need.

9780335206254	Understanding community penalties,probation, policy, and social change	Peter Raynor&Maurice Vanstone		"should be required reading for any practitioner who hasn't yet acquainted themselves with the essential points of probation research. The analysis of OASys and its history is particularly timely." VISTA What are community sentences for? How has the theory and practice of community supervision developed? What kind of impact has research evidence had on policy and practice? Can community sentencing help offenders and protect the public at the same time?Understanding Community Penalties provides a concise and critical understanding of community sentences in relation to policy, practice and research. Coverage of these three contexts is a distinguishing feature of the book, which takes a comprehensive approach informed by the authors' long involvement in this field. It begins by examining the role and function of community sentences, and how they challenge the framework of thinking about punishment in the criminal justice system. The book then traces the historical development of the theory and practice of community supervision, and shows what impact the first wave of research into its effectiveness has had on policy and practice. In the context of the penal crisis in recent years and the construction of crime as a political issue, a critical assessment is made by the authors of the achievements of, and problems facing, community sentencing, and they address the questions facing sentencers, politicians, policy makers and practitioners. In particular, they consider whether current organizational structures and divisions are appropriate for the purposes of punishing and helping in the community those who offend. In all, this authoritative text will be essential reading for students of criminology and criminal justice, and an invaluable reference for researchers and practitioners in the criminal justice system.	2002-07-01	Open University						ZZZ000000
9780335201235	Comparative social policy,theory and research	Patricia Kennett		* What are the social policy processes and outcomes across different societies?* How are these shaped by social and economic conditions? * What are the limitations and potential of cross-national research?Comparative Social Policy explores the new context of social policy and considers how cross-national theory and research can respond to the challenges facing welfare. These challenges include changing demographic trends and economic conditions which have been accompanied by the emergence of new needs and risks within and across societies. This book extends and deepens cross-national research by exploring the theoretical and conceptual frameworks through which social policy and welfare systems have been understood. It critically examines different policy processes and welfare outcomes, as well as the ethnocentricism and cultural imperialism which has permeated cross-national epistemology and methodology. The author concludes by reflecting on how cross-national research can illuminate the complex and diverse processes leading to discrimination and inequality across borders. This leads to a consideration of how it can contribute to the implementation of welfare provision appropriate to the social and economic conditions of contemporary societies. Comparative Social Policy is an essential text for undergraduate and masters level students of social policy, and an invaluable reference for researchers embarking on cross-national social research.	2001	Open University Press						ZZZ000000
9780335208517	Generations, culture and society	June Edmunds&Bryan S. Turner		"...the most important statement since Mannheim's classic work. It establishes a traumatic events theory of generations, and elaborates a model of generational conflict... All this is demonstrated through illuminating analyses... For Edmunds and Turner, generations rather than classes have shaped much of the 20th century and beyond." - Professor Randall Collins, University of Pennsylvania "...clearly establishes the relevance of generations as a key sociological concept for understanding cultural change today...an excellent book that offers students and academics a lively and up-to-date text on the role and significance of generations, with comprehensive coverage of social scientific debates." - Gerard Delanty, Professor of Sociology, University of Liverpool * What is the role of generations in social, cultural and political change? * How is generational consciousness formed? * What is the significance of inter and intra-generational conflict and continuity? Despite the importance of the concept of generations in common sense or lay understanding of cultural change, the study of generations has not played a large part in the development of sociological theory. However, recent social developments, combined with the erosion of a strong class theory, mean that generations need to be reconsidered in relation to cultural change and politics. Moving beyond Karl Mannheim's classical contribution to generations, this book offers a theoretically innovative way of examining the role of generational consciousness in social, cultural and political change through a range of empirical illustrations. On the grounds that existing research on generations has neglected international generational divisions, the book also looks at the interactions between generations and other social categories, including gender and ethnicity, exploring both intra-generational conflict and continuity and considering the circumstances under which generational consciousness may become more salient. The result is a key text for undergraduate courses in social theory, cultural studies and social history, and an essential reference for researchers across these areas, as well as gender, race and ethnicity.	2002	Open University Press						ZZZ000000
9780335206025	Making sense of social movements	Nick Crossley		"...effectively demonstrates the enduring importance of 'classical' social movement theory...and provides a cutting edge critical review of recent theoretical developments. This is one of the most important general theoretical texts on social movements for some years." - Paul Bagguley, University of Leeds  Why and how do social movements emerge?  In which ways are social movements analysed?  Can our understanding be enhanced by new perspectives?Making Sense of Social Movements offers a clear and comprehensive overview of the key sociological approaches to the study of social movements. The author argues that each of these approaches makes an important contribution to our understanding of social movements but that none is adequate on its own. In response he argues for a new approach which draws together key insights within the solid foundations of Pierre Bourdieu's social theory of practice.This new approach transcends the barriers which still often divide European and North American perspectives of social movements, and also those which divide recent approaches from the older 'collective behaviour' approach. The result is a theoretical framework which is uniquely equipped for the demands of modern social movement analysis. The clear and concise style of the text, as well as its neat summaries of key concepts and approaches, will make this book invaluable for undergraduate courses. It will also be an essential reference for researchers.	2002	Open University Press						ZZZ000000

Emphasizing the need for a welcoming and well-informed host environment and suitable specialist services, she reviews the responses of the various institutions, and she debates in detail the different approaches to strategic planning, implementation through agreed tactics, market identification, penetration and consolidation, and student care.	1999	Open University Press						ZZZ000000
9780335204090	Risk, social policy and welfare	Hazel Kemshall		* What is the relevance of the concept of risk to social policy? * Has risk replaced need as the key organizing principle of welfare provision? * Do current trends support the contention that policy development is risk-based? Traditionally, need has been the major mechanism for allocating resources in public services, and social policy texts have addressed various state responses to social problems and the alleviation of need. However, in a period of state retrenchment and welfare restriction, rationing and targeting have become more intense. This book explores the extent to which, as a result, risk and vulnerability have replaced need as the key principles of welfare rationing and provision. It begins with an introductory overview of current theories on risk and goes on to examine the relevance of risk to social policy and welfare developments. This is achieved by drawing on recent social policy and case examples from health, the personal social services and mental health. Written with the needs of undergraduates in mind, the author presents clear examples, provides summaries of key points and makes suggestions for further reading throughout. The result is a highly accessible introduction to the concept of risk for students, researchers and professionals in social policy, health and social welfare.	2002	Open University Press						ZZZ000000
9780335202409	Surveying the social world,principles and practice in survey research	Alan E. Aldridge&Alan Aldridge&Kenneth Levine		* What are the strengths and limitations of social surveys?* How can the principles of surveying be put into practice?* How are findings analysed and results presented? The survey has become a widely used technique for gathering information and opinions from individuals, organizations, and other groups. In Surveying the Social World, Aldridge and Levine begin by examining the contemporary state of surveys within society and social science methodology, explaining the potential of the survey method and the ways it can be used effectively when resources are limited. They then take the reader systematically through the process of conducting survey research covering in turn, the role of theory, the planning and design of projects, pilot work, access to informants, ethical issues, sampling methods, the preparation of questionnaires, interviewing, the use of computer packages, processing responses, statistical methods of data analysis, and the presentation of findings. Unlike some rival texts that stress complications and difficulties of conducting social surveys, this book adopts a consciously 'can-do' approach, emphasizing strategies and practical tips. Written in a direct style with a clear structure, each chapter begins with a list of key elements and concludes with summary points, points for reflection and suggestions for further reading. As well as examples of techniques and good practice from a variety of surveys, the authors use their own Travel Survey throughout the book to illustrate the decisions that need to be taken at each stage of the survey process. For the technical topics, there is a glossary containing over 130 technical terms that are highlighted in thetext. The result is an essential guide to conducting social surveys for students in the social sciences, and for others who need to carry out a community or organizational survey but who may have no previous training in social research methods or experience of survey work.	2001-10-19	Open University Press						ZZZ000000

9780691115108	Islam and Mammon,the economic predicaments of Islamism	Timur Kuran		The doctrine of "Islamic economics" entered debates over the social role of Islam in the mid-twentieth century. Since then it has pursued the goal of restructuring economies according to perceived Islamic teachings. Beyond its most visible practical achievement--the establishment of Islamic banks meant to avoid interest--it has promoted Islamic norms of economic behavior and founded redistribution systems modeled after early Islamic fiscal practices. In this bold and timely critique, Timur Kuran argues that the doctrine of Islamic economics is simplistic, incoherent, and largely irrelevant to present economic challenges. Observing that few Muslims take it seriously, he also finds that its practical applications have had no discernible effects on efficiency, growth, or poverty reduction. Why, then, has Islamic economics enjoyed any appeal at all? Kuran's answer is that the real purpose of Islamic economics has not been economic improvement but cultivation of a distinct Islamic identity to resist cultural globalization. The Islamic subeconomies that have sprung up across the Islamic world are commonly viewed as manifestations of Islamic economics. In reality, Kuran demonstrates, they emerged to meet the economic aspirations of socially marginalized groups. The Islamic enterprises that form these subeconomies provide advancement opportunities to the disadvantaged. By enhancing interpersonal trust, they also facilitate intragroup transactions. These findings raise the question of whether there exist links between Islam and economic performance. Exploring these links in relation to the long-unsettled question of why the Islamic world became underdeveloped, Kuran identifies several pertinent social mechanisms, some beneficial to economic development, others harmful.	2004	Princeton University Press						ZZZ000000

9781861977595	Moscow 1941,a city and its people at war	Rodric Braithwaite		A brilliantly researched and realized history, an essential addition to the literature of World War II. The 1941 Battle of Moscow-- unquestionably one of the most decisive battles of the Second World War-- marked the first strategic defeat of the German armed forces in their seemingly unstoppable march across Europe. The Soviets lost many more people in that one battle than the British and Americans lost in the whole of the war. Now, with authority and narrative power, Rodric Braithwaite tells the story in large part through the individual experiences of ordinary Russian men and women. Setting his narrative firmly against the background of Moscow and its people, Braithwaite begins in early 1941, when the Soviet Union was still untouched by the war raging to the west. We see how-- despite abundant secret intelligence-- the breaching of the border by the Wehrmacht in June took the country by surprise, and how, when the Germans pushed to Moscow in November, the Red Army and the capital' s inhabitants undertook to defend their city. Finally, in the winter of 1941- 1942, they turned the Germans back on the very outskirts. Braithwaite' s dramatic, richly illustrated narrative of the military action offers telling portraits of Stalin and his generals. By interweaving the personal remembrances of soldiers, politicians, writers, artists, workers, and schoolchildren, he gives us an unprecedented understanding of how the war affected the daily life of Moscow, and of the extraordinary bravery, endurance, and sacrifice-- both voluntary and involuntary-- that was required of its citizens.	2006-01	Profile Books Ltd.

9781861977021	Business consulting,a guide to how it works and how to make it work	Gilbert Toppin&Fiona Czerniawska		The economic slowdown during the early 2000s tapered the once-vibrant growth of the consultancy industry. Not helping matters, in many cases, was increasing skepticism about the true value that consultants genuinely add to the bottom line. As firms have cut back and begun to review the way they use consultants, consulting firms themselves are looking at how they need to change. People are now talking about business consulting rather than management consulting. Using real examples from a range of private sector firms, public sector organizations, and from the consultants themselves, this book explores the new business consulting world. The authors examine all elements of the consulting process to help firms make better use of consultants and to show consultants how they need to adapt. With the right relationship in place, consultants and companies can work together to arrive at mutually beneficial solutions. With 90 percent of Fortune 500 firms using consultants on a regular basis (with varying results), this book provides relevant, timely information on an important area of global business.	2005-07-01	Profile						ZZZ000000

Risk of failure can be greatly reduced through effective organisational design that encourages high performance and adaptability to changing circumstances.

9781846681936	Marketing,A Guide to the Fundamentals	Patrick Forsyth		Even though organisations have become increasingly marketing-focussed in their approach and it is clear that marketing is more than just the marketing department marketing is one of the most misunderstood areas of business. Philip Kotler, an American marketing guru, defines it as the business function that identifies current unfulfilled needs and wants, defines and measures their magnitude, determines which target markets the organisation can best serve and decides on appropriate products, services, and programmes to serve these markets. Thus marketing serves as the link between a societys needs and its pattern of industrial response. The late Peter Drucker, a leading management thinker, was content to say simply: Marketing is looking at the business through the customers' eyes.This new guide clarifies exactly what marketing is and how it works, and it explains the techniques involved. For anyone who wants to understand the marketing mix, the factors involved in pricing policy, the different methods of market research, indeed the whole business of marketing, this guide to the fundamentals will be invaluable.	2009-08-06	Profile Books						ZZZ000000
9781846680090	Moral relativism	Steven Lukes		A book on moral relativism by someone with a steely understanding of social reality? Only Steven Lukes could write it.Richard Sennett, author of The CraftsmanIn the current age of mass immigration, religious extremism and international terrorism issues of global morality are more pertinent than ever. But many people who are naturally-inclined to believe in universal human rights also have a fear of ethnocentric arrogance. This conflict is central to the highly-charged debate about moral relativism. One may be repulsed by female circumcision, but is such opposition merely a form of moral imperialism?In this book, Steven Lukes examines what people believe and why. Is there any common ground, or is it simply a matter of us and them? For instance, do East Asian values inherently challenge those held in the West? Lukes incisive polemic cuts to the heart of the matter by focussing on the best arguments from both sides. He strips back conjecture to leave us with the key issues before laying bare the shocking requirements that moral relativism makes of its true advocates. This is philosophy at its exciting best and most relevant.	2009-01-22	Profile Books						ZZZ000000

9781861972354	Rhythms of life,the biological clocks that control the daily lives of every living thing	Russell G. Foster&Leon Kreitzman		An eye-opening discussion of how biological clocks affect the lives of all living organismsWhy can't teenagers get out of bed in the morning? How do bees tell the time? Why do some plants open and close their flowers at the same time each day? Why do so many people suffer the misery of jet lag? In this fascinating book, Russell Foster and Leon Kreitzman explain the significance of the biological clock, showing how it has played an essential role in evolution and why it continues to play a vitally important role in all living organisms.The authors tell us that biological clocks are embedded in our genes and reset at sunrise and sunset each day to link astronomical time with an organism's internal time. They discuss how scientists are working out the clockwork mechanisms and what governs them, and they describe how organisms measure different intervals of time, how they are adapted to various cycles, and how light coordinates the time within to the external world. They review problems that can be caused by malfunctioning biological clocks--including jet lag, seasonal affective disorder, and depression. And they warn that although new drugs are being promoted to allow us to stay awake for longer periods, a 24/7 lifestyle can have a harmful impact on our health, both as individuals and as a society. Russell Foster is professor of molecular neuroscience at Imperial College, London, and is a leading expert on chronobiology.

9781861973603	Successful mergers	Marion Devine		Mergers and acquisitions trigger change on a huge scale, often causing chain reactions within a business sector as companies combine in the race to gain competitive advantage. Like atomic reactions, M&As release bursts of energy within companies, some of which are creative and some of which can be destructive. This book examines how companies can make a success out of what has been shown repeatedly to be a course of action that is difficult, disruptive and unpredictable. Its principal argument is that for an M&A to be successful attention must be given to getting the people involved "on side" as early as possible. Anyone who thinks they can bolt two businesses together and leave sorting out cultural conflicts and the like until the end of the process is making a big mistake.

Companies such as IBM, Procter & Gamble, Mexican-based Cemex and Japanese-based Omron provide the models that businesses small and large can use to stay on track, outstrip the competition, and attract and motivate the new generation of talent. And, Professor Kanter provides the evidence of the powerful synergy between the financial success shareholders want and social conscience - it is only these 'vanguard companies' that are big but human, efficient but innovative, global but local, that will succeed in the future.	2010-02-01	Profile Books						ZZZ000000

9781846682742	Big Idea	Robert Jones		Today's marketplace is a war of ideas. Unless you stand for something you won't stand out. Nowadays anyone can copy your product, or even your business model. What they can't copy is your worldview, your attitude, your special way of doing things. So the war in the marketplace will be a war of ideas. The Big Idea maps this new territory and shows how big ideas make great companies. Unlike business models or the catchphrases of management gurus, a big idea is emotional. And unlike corporate ideologies, vision or brand, it is shared between customers and employees alike. Companies who have distinguished themselves with a big idea include: Virgin (not British Airways) John Lewis (not Debenhams) Apple (not IBM) Ikea (not MFI) Orange (not Cellnet) Customers don't just buy from these companies, they buy into them - they choose them not through economic logic, but emotional logic. As products and services become more and more similar, emotional logic will become the single most important business driver. The benefits of appealing to it can already be seen: Orange has a much lower turnover of customers than Cellnet and Ikea operates in over 23 countries while MFI only does business in Britain. A big idea isn't just a cute thing to have: it's the spark that makes places thrive while others just exist.	2008-11-26	Profile Books Ltd						ZZZ000000

9780415151900	Reflexive ethnography,a guide to researching selves and others	Charlotte Aull Davies		Ethnographic research is fundamental to the discipline of anthropology.

9780765803986	Designing clothes,culture and organization of the fashion industry	Veronica Manlow		Fashion is all around us: we see it, we buy it, we read about it, but most people know little about fashion as a business. In this volume, Veronica Manlow considers the broader significance of fashion in society, the creative process of fashion design, and how fashion unfolds in an organizational context where design is conceived and executed. Fashion firms are not just in the business of selling clothing along with a variety of sidelines. These companies must also sell a larger concept around which people can identify and distinguish themselves from others. Manlow defines the four main tasks of a fashion firm as creation of an image, translation of that image into a product, presentation of the product, and selling the product. Each of these processes is interrelated and each requires the efforts of a variety of specialists, who are often in distant locations. Manlow shows how the design and presentation of fashion is influenced by changes in society, both cultural and economic. Information about past sales and reception of items, as well as projective research informs design, manufacturing, sales, distribution, and marketing decisions.	2007-06-06	Transaction Publishers						ZZZ000000

9788130909578	Book Numbers: Indian And Cutter	Mohinder Partap Satija		This manual of book numbers explains the working mechanism of book numbers in all their intricacies. It illustrates the versatility of book numbering systems designed by Asa D. Dickinson, Sayyed Bashiruddin, S. R. Ranganathan, the National Library of India and Charles Ammi Cutter. Systems by Dickinson and Bashiruddin are now somewhat obscured by time. Here they are again brought to light. Dickinson method is a simplification of Cutter table made to suit Indian libraries at that time. Professor Bashiruddin devised author marks for books in Indian languages, including Urdu. His Hindi table has been described in detail with numerous newly devised examples of representative Hindi authors. His original table has been enormously expanded. Both these systems are for small libraries.Ranganathan s book number system is described in its minutest details with many suitable examples. His system is applicable to all libraries transcending the barrier of language and collection size. The author table designed by the National Library, Kolkata, is for Indian language writers. This table makes a long list of Indian authors writing in Indian vernaculars and proposes their author numbers in Roman script.This book explains with ample examples the book number systems devised by S. R. Ranganathan, S. Bashiruddin, Asa Don Dickinson and the National Library of India, and offers a brief but practical introduction to Cutter-Sanborn Table. Book numbers have an important role to play in shelf classification in the era of relative location of books. There are only a few authentic books on book numbers, and the major texts in the subject are all written in the American context. Book Numbers: Indian and Cutter supplements these books and exposes the Indian systems to a wider community of practising librarians and library science teachers. Moreover, it illustrates and explains what Ranganathan and others have at times merely insinuated.	2008-01-01	Viva Books Private Limited						ZZZ000000

9788130910147	Delhi Sultanate	Iqtidar Husain Siddiqui		Breaking the conventional belief that urbanization was shaped solely by economic factors, Delhi Sultanate seeks to highlight social and cultural processes that accompanied economic changes, thereby transforming little-known trading towns into full-fledged centres of learning and culture. I.H. Siddiqui draws on a rich corpus of Persian sources to establish links between economic change and changes in language, literature, teaching, book trade and even pyrotechnics. Delving into unconventional markers of change like food makes the work interesting and informative. The case study of the city of Kalpi is valuable, for it outlines the political, social and cultural ramifications brought by its transformation into an urban city. Modern scholars have studied the political history of the Delhi Sultanate in detail since the colonial period. However, its cultural splendour has not received adequate attention, although the standards set during the Delhi Sultanate period in arts, architecture, literature and its currency retained their appeal and provided a reference point to the Mughals. The author probes into the complex socio-cultural phenomena and uses his analysis to unravel less- known aspects of the Sultanate political economy, the process of urbanization, economy and trade and their impact on society. Besides new professions that flourished as well as scientific developments, teaching and literary traditions that led to social change and enhanced social mobility are discussed in detail. His exposition of the social and economic role of the bazaars and urban centres in general, and in the metropolis of Delhi in particular, is a valuable contribution to our understanding of the history and composite culture that developed during the Delhi Sultanate period. Contents: Introduction " The Delhi Sultanate: Political Economy and Public Welfare " The Process of Urbanization " Economy and Trade " Food and Its Socio-Cultural Significance " Pyrotechnics and the Growth of Firearms " Social Mobility and Emergence of New Social Groups " Scientific developments in the Delhi Sultanate " The Teaching Tradition " The Literary Tradition " Syncretic Tradition : Translation of Arabic and Sanskrit Classics into Persian " The City of Kalpi	2010-01-01	Viva Books Private Limited						ZZZ000000

9788130905990	Invitation To Biotechnology	Rupinder Tiwari		Biotechnology has taken the world by a storm. With the plethora of possibilities afforded by it, there is no sphere of human activity left untouched. This book has at its core an explanation of the basic principles underlying this field. They have been dealt with in a manner so lucid and simple that even a non-biologist would feel completely at home with these concepts. Terms such as GMO, gene therapy, genetic engineering, stem cells, clones, transgenic, DNA fingerprinting, designer animals, patents, nanotechnology, super bugs and fermentation, have been explained in a simple manner. Using state-of-the-art technologies, scientists have created vitamin enriched rice, anti-cancer tomatoes, transgenic animals producing life saving therapeutics like blood-clot busters, insulin, haemoglobin and transgenic bacteria that have the ability to degrade environmentally hazardous compounds. Biotechnologists are also trying to generate human organs and tissues from the stem cells present in a human body. All such developments have been touched upon in this book. A strong reference has been made to technological advances which have made them to news headlines, like the cloning of the sheep Dolly , DNA fingerprinting used in the identification of a rapist and biological father of a child.

9788130910086	Old wisdom and new horizon	Manoj Kumar Pal&Centre for Studies in Civilizations (Delhi&India)&Project of History of Indian Science&Philosophy&and Culture. Sub Project: Consciousness&Science&Society&Value&and Yoga		This book by an internationally reputed Indian scientist traces the developments of Science, Religion and Philosophy in human civilization through the ages. The common underlying bond-more specifically, a linkage of philosophy with both science and religion-has been examined incisively. All the three sub-areas of human culture have been presented from a holistic point of view, and at the same time, stressing some of their irreconcilable basic differences in scope and outlook. Meant primarily for general readers, the book achieves a fine balance between basic comcepts, historical evolution and a critical unbiased analysis of rituals, dogmas, unresolved queries and it leads to an enlightened view of 'humanism', 'Nature', 'Unity of man', need for a new paradigm of social and political order transcending globalization and control of resources of weaker nations by supremacy in global power equation. The book reviews the wisdom of the ancient Hindus, Buddhism, Jainism and of the three semitic religions-Judaism, Christianity and Islam. It presents a concise account of the Indian Vedas, Vedangan, Saddarsana, the two epics and the Bhagavadgita, of the philosophy and science of the Greeks, science and technology of ancient Egypt, Babylonia and China. A valuable special feature is a summary of the status of present-day science, starting with the classical phase, and ending with the developments in the last century comprising the Theory of Relativity, quantum physics, genetics, various aspects of human consciousness, modern astronomy, astrophysics and cosmology. Last but not least, the author critically reviews some of the presentday fashionable discourses on 'science as the best way to reach God' and leads the readers to an appraisal of the on-going researches on the unification of the four fundamental interactions of physical sciences. He ends with the inexorable conclusion that this unification, when fully achieved, would still not strictly identify the unique force as 'God as concieved in different religions.	2008	Jointly Published by CSC and Viva Books for the Project of History of Indian Science, Philosophy, and Culture						ZZZ000000

9788130930978	Son Of The Soil	Nazrul Islam		This is a significant, well-written and revised edition of the bestselling Bangla novel Bhumiputra. The translation has come at an appropriate juncture in the life of the Indian Muslim. This is admirable due to the many aspects of historic anti-islam feelings prevalent within some areas of our public life.This exceptional book covers anguish, hurt and pain of an average Muslim in its many forms and more importantly reflects and gives us hope. A must read if you want to understand the feelings of a pure Muslim, his ideals and dreams. Kamal the protagonist of this book is hurt by the Anti-Muslim uttering of Bankim in the Anandamantha; he is also not in agreement with many of the dictums of Islam. This inner fighting of Kamal gets vivid expressions in this novel.A vast majority of well educated people amongst us are ignorant of what has happened to the Muslims in independent India. The populist element in our culture has stuck to a very cliched image of Islam. By comparison, the Muslims themselves are largely and intensely conscious of their painful history.	2005	Viva Books Private Limited						ZZZ000000

The Apple of Discord looks into ten of the most difficult marriages on record some fictional, some not culminating in Gandhi s union with the woman who taught him the practice of non-violent resistance by opposing him. Other investigated unions include that of Socrates and the notorious shrew Xanthippe, and perhaps the most documented of all marriages, Tolstoy s own, a war of attrition that came to an end only when the sage took to the road at the age of eighty-two and found refuge in death s waiting arms.In the marriages probed in The Apple of Discord the wise behave like fools, men and women become bond-slaves of the ridiculous, and all risk losing understanding of themselves.

But Nature invents, too-through evolutionary watersheds like vertebrate mammals and formerly grounded creatures making the leap to flight. How, then, does breakthrough thinking really work? What, if anything, does human invention have in common with biological evolution? Drawing on a rich knowledge of artificial intelligence and cognitive psychology, David Perkins offers a uniquely integrative theory of how breakthroughs occur, along with dozens of delightful mind puzzles and illustrations that will have you quizzing whomever happens to be nearest.

It also happens quickly -- so quickly and frequently that it changes how all of us live our lives: drugs fail because diseases evolve; insects overcome the most powerful pesticides; HIV and tuberculosis develop resistance to the newest drugs in a few months. This is evolution with teeth.While the ecological scars of human technology have been well publicized, the broad evolutionary consequences of antibiotic and antiviral use, insecticide applications, and herbicide bioengineering are largely unexplored. Does the human impact on evolution falter at the borders of our own species? Or do we, in fact, generate our own evolutionary pressure?Enthusiastically written for a wide audience, The Evolution Explosion examines these practical and critical aspects of modern evolution with simplicity, force, and humor.	2001	Norton						ZZZ000000

9780393960426	Sister Carrie,an authoritative text, backgrounds, and sources criticism	Theodore Dreiser&Donald Pizer		Theodore Dreiser had a hardscrabble youth and the years of newspaper work behind him when he began his first novel, "Sister Carrie," the story of a beautiful Midwestern girl who makes it big in New York City. Published by Doubleday in 1900, it gained a reputation as a shocker, for Dreiser had dared to give the public a heroine whose "cosmopolitan standard of virtue" brings her from Wisconsin, with four dollars in her purse, to a suite at the Waldorf and glittering fame as an actress. With "Sister Carrie," the original manuscript of which is in the New York Public Library collections, Dreiser told a tale not "sufficiently delicate" for many of its first readers and critics, but which is now universally recognized as one of the greatest and most influential American novels.	1991	Norton						ZZZ000000

9780749435059	The New Barbarian Manifesto,How to Survive the Information Age	Ian O. Angell		Ian Angell, dubbed "the Angell of Doom" by The (London) Times, lays out his manifesto for the New Barbarians who will lead the economic elite into a Brave New World over the next two decades. He rejects the long-held view of information technology as our benign liberator from mundane work. Instead, he regards it as the seed for a new society, in which the winners in the knowledge economy will construct their own "smart regions" founded on libertarian principles and enlightened self-interest. The losers, however, face a bleak future. The three evils of religion, ethnicity and socialism will prey on the economic insecurity of the masses, as transnational businesses roam the globe in search of ever cheaper labour. If this scenario seems unlikely, look now at the life prisoners in US jails who operate telesales services for major US companies. Angell predicts that IT, far from creating the path to Utopia, will spell poverty for the many and self-governing opulence for the few. Only those individuals with the knowledge, talent and power to guide this social revolution will prosper, liberated from taxation, while semi-skilled and unskilled labour become commodities, and the billion disenfranchised production workers worldwide compete on price against more efficient robots.	2001	Kogan Page Publishers						ZZZ000000

Gamble&Merlin Stone&Neil Woodcock		* Includes a new free CD-ROM * Published in association with IBM and Ogilvy Effective customer relationship marketing (CRM) is one of the most important challenges faced by the management team of a modern enterprise. In a highly competitive and demanding environment, more and more companies are seeking to establish the strategies, culture, processes and technologies that will make it just that little bit harder for customers to make a switching or even a multi-sourcing decision. Nobody can completely predict human behavior but the ideas behind CRM are certainly designed to ensure the best chance of success. CRM remains the biggest revolution yet in marketing, the power of new technology having swept it to the forefront of management thinking. Although based on apparently simple ideas involving keeping in touch and responding to customer contacts, many companies still shy away from the awesome task of building a relationship with thousands, or even millions, of people. As customers become increasingly sophisticated in their expectations, the diversity and range of products and services on offer gets even wider. So how can you ensure that your product or service is their preferred choice, and, importantly, that it continues to be? Do customers become confused by too extensive a choice? Will people welcome a close relationship with their suppliers or will they find it over-intrusive and an invasion of privacy? Database technology of different kinds can facilitate a range of relationship marketing techniques. The important issues for modern enterprises, large and small, are to understand the why, what, how, when and where of using them. "Up Close and Personal?" provides important andpractical new insights into effective customer relationship marketing by looking in depth at: * Strategies, policies and plans; * Measuring the impact; * Segmentation; * The implementation program; * Customer loyalty and continuity; * Transparent marketing, customer value and process management; * Customer knowledge management; * Technical systems and data management; * Managing good and bad customers * Establishing ROI and satisfying the Board This second edition has been fully updated throughout and contains new material on data management, key performance indicators and benefit analysis.

It is clear that businesses that develop closer relationships with their customers can compete better. However, these relationships cannot be built overnight. The capabilities necessary to sustain and develop them require careful consideration. Enterprises that build their CRM systems now will be the organizations of the future.	2003	Kogan Page Publishers						ZZZ000000

9781845690335	Composites forming technologies	Andrew Craig Long&Textile Institute (Manchester&England)		When forming composite materials with textiles there is always a degree of error when draping a fabric over the mould and adding the resin. The fabric can deform or shift in the mould before adding the resin or whilst it is being poured in. Such problems can cause weaknesses in the composite leading to failure or even rendering the composite useless, meaning the whole process has to be started again. In order to counteract this it is necessary to be able to model the draping of different textiles to fully understand the issues that may arise and how to prevent them from occurring in the future. Composites forming technologies brings together the research of leading experts in the area to give a comprehensive understanding of modelling and simulation within composite forming and design. Analysis techniques, computer software and technology for forming different types of composites are also covered. CONTENTS Forming mechanisms and materials characterisation; Constitutive modelling; The use of draping simulation in composites design; Finite element analysis of composite forming; Virtual testing to establish material formability; Optimisation of composite forming; Compression moulding simulation; Forming technology - thermoplastics; Forming technology - thermosets; Composite/metal hybrids; Forming of self-reinforced polymer materials; Geometrical deformations/spring-forward due to tool/part; Benchmarking of composites forming analysis techniques.	2007	Woodhead						ZZZ000000
9781845692445	Delamination behaviour of composites	Srinivasan Sridharan&Institute of Materials&Minerals&and Mining		Delamination is a phenomenon that is of critical importance to the composite industry. It involves a breakdown in the bond between the reinforcement and the matrix material of the composite. With growing use of composites in aerospace and other sectors, understanding delamination is essential for preventing catastrophic failures. This important book reviews the phenomenon of delamination in composites. Part 1 focuses on delamination as a mode of failure. Part 2 covers testing of delamination resistance, while part 3 analyses detection and characterisation. Further parts cover analysis of delamination behaviour from tests, modelling delamination, analysis of structural performance under delamination and preventing and mitigation of delamination.	2008-10-21	Woodhead						ZZZ000000

9780393051797	The human web,a bird's-eye view of world history	John Robert McNeill&William Hardy McNeill		Why did the first civilizations emerge when and where they did? How did Islam become a unifying force in the world of its birth? What enabled the West to project its goods and power around the world from the fifteenth century on? Why was agriculture invented seven times and the steam engine just once?World-historical questions such as these, the subjects of major works by Jared Diamond, David Landes, and others, are now of great moment as global frictions increase. In a spirited and original contribution to this quickening discussion, two renowned historians, father and son, explore the webs that have drawn humans together in patterns of interaction and exchange, cooperation and competition, since earliest times. Whether small or large, loose or dense, these webs have provided the medium for the movement of ideas, goods, power, and money within and across cultures, societies, and nations. From the thin, localized webs that characterized agricultural communities twelve thousand years ago, through the denser, more interactive metropolitan webs that surrounded ancient Sumer, Athens, and Timbuktu, to the electrified global web that today envelops virtually the entire world in a maelstrom of cooperation and competition, J. R. McNeill and William H. McNeill show human webs to be a key component of world history and a revealing framework of analysis. Avoiding any determinism, environmental or cultural, the McNeills give us a synthesizing picture of the big patterns of world history in a rich, open-ended, concise account.	2003-02-25	W. W.

9780393060942	Kingdom coming,the rise of Christian nationalism	Michelle Goldberg		Michelle Goldberg, a senior political reporter for Salon.com, has been covering the intersection of politics and ideology for years. Before the 2004 election, and during the ensuing months when many Americans were trying to understand how an administration marked by cronyism, disregard for the national budget, and poorly disguised self-interest had been reinstated, Goldberg traveled through the heartland of a country in the grips of a fevered religious radicalism: the America of our time. From the classroom to the mega-church to the federal court, she saw how the growing influence of dominionism-the doctrine that Christians have the right to rule nonbelievers-is threatening the foundations of democracy. In Kingdom Coming, Goldberg demonstrates how an increasingly bellicose fundamentalism is gaining traction throughout our national life, taking us on a tour of the parallel right-wing evangelical culture that is buoyed by Republican political patronage. Deep within the red zones of a divided America, we meet military retirees pledging to seize the nation in Christ's name, perfidious congressmen courting the confidence of neo-confederates and proponents of theocracy, and leaders of federally funded programs offering Jesus as the solution to the country's social problems. With her trenchant interviews and the telling testimonies of the people behind this movement, Goldberg gains access into the hearts and minds of citizens who are striving to remake the secular Republic bequeathed by our founders into a Christian nation run according to their interpretation of scripture. In her examination of the ever-widening divide between believers and nonbelievers, Goldberg illustrates the subversive effect of this conservative stranglehold nationwide. In an age when faith rather than reason is heralded and the values of the Enlightenment are threatened by a mystical nationalism claiming divine sanction, Kingdom Coming brings us face to face with the irrational forces that are remaking much of America.	2006	W.W.

9780393059960	Knowledge and the wealth of nations,a story of economic discovery	David Warsh		A stimulating and inviting tour of modern economics centered on the story of one of its most important breakthroughs. In 1980, the twenty-four-year-old graduate student Paul Romer tackled one of the oldest puzzles in economics. Eight years later he solved it. This book tells the story of what has come to be called the new growth theory: the paradox identified by Adam Smith more than two hundred years earlier, its disappearance and occasional resurfacing in the nineteenth century, the development of new technical tools in the twentieth century, and finally the student who could see further than his teachers. Fascinating in its own right, new growth theory helps to explain dominant first-mover firms like IBM or Microsoft, underscores the value of intellectual property, and provides essential advice to those concerned with the expansion of the economy. Like James Gleick's "Chaos" or Brian Greene's "The Elegant Universe," this revealing book takes us to the frontlines of scientific research; not since Robert Heilbroner's classic work "The Worldly Philosophers" have we had as attractive a glimpse of the essential science of economics.	2006	W.

9780393047479	Michael Jordan and the new global capitalism	Walter LaFeber		With Michael Jordan and the New Global Capitalism, Walter LaFeber has written a biography, a social history, and a far-ranging economic critique. From basketball prodigy to international phenomenon to seductive commercial ideal, Michael Jordan is the supreme example of how American corporations have used technology in a brave, massively wired new world to sell their products in every corner of the globe. LaFeber's examination of Nike and its particular dominion over the global marketplace is often scathing, while his fascinating mini-biography of Michael Jordan and the commercial history of basketball reveal much about American society. "LaFeber brings an impressive intellect to bear on his subject", Barbara Rudolph wrote in the Chicago Tribune: how the devices of triumphant capitalism, coupled with high-tech telecommunications, are conquering the nations of the world, one mind -- one pair of feet -- at a time.	1999-07-12	W.W.

9780393061840	The money men,capitalism, democracy, and the hundred years' war over the American dollar	H. W. Brands		A best-selling historian's gripping account of the powerful men who controlled America's financial destiny. From the first days of the United States, a battle raged over money. On one side were the democrats, who wanted cheap money and feared the concentration of financial interests in the hands of a few. On the other were the capitalists who sought the soundness of a national bank--and the profits that came with it. In telling this exciting story, H. W. Brands focuses on five "Money Men": Alexander Hamilton, who championed a national bank; Nicholas Biddle, whose run-in with Andrew Jackson led to the bank's demise; Jay Cooke, who financed the Union in the Civil War; Jay Gould, who tried to corner the gold market; and J. P. Morgan, whose position was so commanding that he bailed out the U.S. Treasury. "The Money Men" is a riveting narrative, a revealing history of the men who fought over the lifeblood of American commerce and power.	2006-09-26	W. W. Norton & Company						ZZZ000000

Through comparisons to other equally exotic animals, Conniff uncovers surprising commonalties.-- How did Bill Gates achieve his single greatest act of social dominance by being nice?-- How does the flattery of the rich resemble the grooming behavior of baboons?-- What made the British aristocracy the single most successful animal dominance hierarchy in the history of the planet?-- How does Old Money's disdain for the nouveaux riches resemble the pig-grunting of mountain gorillas?This marvelously entertaining field guide captures in vivid detail the behaviors and habitats of the world's most captivating yet elusive animal.	2002-10-29	W.W.

9780393047738	Oak,the frame of civilization	William Bryant Logan		THE STORY OF OAK is at the root of everything we know. The oak tree is everywhere in the temperate zones of the world; knowing how to use it has made an astonishing difference to human history. Acorncating has sustained humans and animals; oak has been central to religious rites, heating, homemaking, and travel by land and sea; the ink from oak galls advanced the written word; oak casks have made possible food and drink storage and transport; oak ships have fought the dramatic naval battles that determined political and economic history. William Bryant Logan combines science, philosophy, spirituality, and history with a quirky curiosity about why the natural world works the way it does. In lively literary prose, he narrates the biography of the tree that since time immemorial has been a symbol of loyalty and strength, generosity and renewal. The oak has been both a patient teacher and an inexhaustible subject. Recent studies reveal remarkable facts about its communitarian nature--proving that the oak can yet instruct us.	2005-06-07	W. W.

9780393057881	Rediscovering Homer,inside the origins of the epic	Andrew Dalby		Who created theOdysseyand theIliad? A portrait of the poet and the world. Scholar Andrew Dalby delves into the world that first heard theOdysseyand theIliad, and asks new questions about the poet named Homer. Dalby follows the growth of the legend of Troy from its kernel of historical truth, and retraces the succession of singers who re-created the unforgettable story for generations of audiences. He asks why the two great epics at last crossed the frontier from song to writing, and how this astonishing transformation from the singer's mouth to the goatskin page was achieved. A gifted detective of the classical world, Dalby finds new approaches to the personality of Homer, showing how the earliest evidence has been misread. He makes a powerful case that both poems are the work of a single poet and comes to an ultimate conclusion that will surprise even serious classical scholars: Homer was most likely a woman.	2006	W.W.

9780393052039	Taming American power,the global response to U.S. primacy	Stephen M. Walt		The United States currently wields unprecedented global power. Americans often assume that their global role is benevolent and their dominant position unchallenged, but other states are increasingly worried about U.S. dominance and are beginning to turn their concerns into action. In this elegant and provocative new book, Kennedy School professor and renowned scholar Stephen M. Walt analyzes the different strategies that states employ to counter U.S. power or to harness it for their own ends. These responses threaten America's ability to achieve its foreign policy goals and may eventually undermine its dominant position. To prevent this, Walt argues, the United States must adopt a foreign policy that other states welcome, rather than one that reinforces their fear of American power.	2005	Norton						ZZZ000000

To the Light reaches out to those who practice Buddhism and those who are intrigued by it, actual and armchair travelers, and aficionados of fine photography.	2003	W.W. Norton						ZZZ000000
9780393060027	War and the American presidency	Arthur Meier Schlesinger		The Bush Doctrine in foreign policy and what it means for American democracy. The gravest decision in a democracy is the one to go to war. In a book that brings a magisterial command of history to the most urgent of contemporary questions, two-time Pulitzer Prize-winning historian Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr., explores the war in Iraq, the presidency, and the future of democracy. Describing unilateralism as "the oldest doctrine in American history," Schlesinger nevertheless warns of the dangers posed by the fatal turn in U.S. policy from deterrence and containment to preventive war. He writes powerfully about George W. Bush's expansion of presidential power and the revived Imperial Presidency (a phrase Schlesinger invented). He reminds us of our country's distinguished legacy of patriotism through dissent in wartime, calling on us to honor that tradition even in the face of our need for security. And he reminds us of the inscrutability of history. War and the American Presidency shines an essential light on the meaning of our history and a guide for using our understanding responsibly in meeting today's challenges.	2004-09-13	W. W.

9780393094121	Moll Flanders, an authoritative text,backgrounds and sources; criticism	Daniel Defoe&Edward Kelly		As Moll Flanders struggles for survival amid the harsh social realities of seventeenth-century England, there is but one snare she is determined to avoid - the deadly snare of poverty. On the twisting path that leads from her birth in Newgate prison to her final prosperous respectability, love is regarded as worth no more than its weght in gold; and such matters as bigamy, incest, theft, and prostitution occasion but a brief blush before they are reckoned in terms of profit and losss. Yet so pure is her candor, so healthy her animal appetites, so indomitable her resilience through every vicissitude of fortune, that this extraordinary wench emerges as far more than a prototype of the mercantile mind. In "Moll Flanders" Defoe added a fresh dimension to the art of writing. "We seem to see Defoe's characters through the crytal-clear medium of his style with perfect verisimilitude, as real as if we saw them in a mirror that was so flawless that it was invisible, " writes Kennth Rexroth. Virginia Woolf ranked "Moll Flanders" as "among the few English novels which we can call indisputably great."	1973	Norton						ZZZ000000

Tibetan masters encourage us not to lose heart - catastrophes have happened before and we have overcome them and moved forward. This book brings together Tibetan Buddhist teachings and contemporary politics - presents traditional Buddhist teachings in a practical, readable way to help the reader cultivate the inner resources necessary to meet challenge and conflict - both in himself and in the world. "It is about changing your life from within and then reaching out to change the world around you... No good thought, gesture, or act is ever wasted and will slowly but assuredly bring about the changes that we all, as humans, want to experience and share with those we love." (from Robert Sachs' Introduction.) To achieve this vision we need to take personal responsibility for the future while understanding that there is no need to despair. Become a "conscious, engaged activist" - someone who has a firm foundation in spiritual principles that inform his actions as he seeks social or political change. This is an inspirational and potentially life-changing book.	2006-02-02	Watkins						ZZZ000000

9781842931387	Goal Mapping	Brian Mayne		Why are some people so much more successful than others, and what does it take for people to achieve their true desires? It was this burning question that inspired Brian Mayne to come up with the Goal Mapping system. The system has achieved formidable success as part of corporate training, with students and school children and indeed for individuals in personal development workshops. The Goal Mapping system is a combination of ancient wisdom, accelerated learning and goal setting principles. Where most goal setting techniques focus on left brain words and endless repetition to condition the goals into the subconscious, Goal Mapping uses imagery - the language of the subconscious. The Goal Maps combine words with pictures and symbols, and are thus able to impact on both the left and the right sides of the brain, to create extraordinary power. Whatever your dream, Goal Mapping can help you achieve it.	2006-01-19	Duncan Baird Publishers						SEL031000

9781842931905	What Islam did for us	Tim Wallace-Murphy		In these troubled and extremist times, when the religion and culture of Islam is under seemingly perpetual attack, it is salutary to consider how much we have in common, and how much we, in the Christian West, owe to the spiritual insights of that great culture. Religious toleration, respect for learning, the concepts of chivalry and brotherhood - these principles were brought by the Islamic Moors when, in medieval Spain, they acted as "Beacons of Light" in the Dark Ages of European religious arrogance, intolerance and persecution. The Moors gave Europe an architectural and artistic heritage that is still a source of wonder to the modern world. It was in translation from Arabic, not the original Greek, that knowledge of the Greek philosophy became prominent in Christian thought. Western mathematics are based on Arabic numerals and calculations, and the first effective medical school in Europe was founded by Jewish doctors who had been trained in Moorish Spain and North Africa. Tim Wallace-Murphy shows how over the last century it was European Western Powers who laid the foundations for the chaos that reigns in the Middle East. We need to find a just and equitable solution to these problems and we should begin by acknowledging our common spiritual heritage and the profound debt that Western civilization owes to Islamic culture.	2006-09-30	Watkins						ZZZ000000
9781842931325	Who built the moon?	Christopher Knight&Alan Butler		The authors of "Civilization One" return, bringing new evidence about the Moon that will shake up our world. Christopher Knight and Alan Butler realized that the ancient system of geometry they presented in their earlier, breakthrough study works as perfectly for the Moon as it does the Earth. They found a consistent sequence of integer numbers that they can apply to every major aspect of the Moon; no such pattern emerges for any other planet or moon in the solar system. In addition, Knight and Butler discovered that the Moon possesses few or no heavy metals and has no core--something that should not be possible. Their persuasive conclusion: if higher life only developed on Earth because the Moon is exactly "what" it is and "where" it is, it becomes unreasonable to cling to the idea that the Moon is a natural object--an idea with profound implications.	2005-01	Watkins						ZZZ000000

9781844831524	Ancient China,life, myth and art	Edward L. Shaughnessy		Long before the civilizations of ancient Greece and Rome, China was already a vast empire, protected from the nomads of the Asian steppes by its famous Great Wall, and with rich and distinctive traditions in the arts, technology, and philosophy. Drawing on the latest discoveries by historians and archaeologists, this richly illustrated volume focuses on the outstanding achievements of ancient China. Spectacular artistic highlights include the glorious bronze cauldrons of the Shang dynasty, Buddhist cave paintings depicting daily life, and the Terracotta Army—the extraordinary legion of clay soldiers fashioned to protect the First Emperor in the afterlife. Tracing the succession of dynasties from c.2000 BC to the end of the great Tang empire in the 10th century AD, Ancient China offers fascinating insights into key themes of Chinese life, society, and culture, including mythology, literature, music, calligraphy, Taoism, Buddhism, medicine, cooking, and the silk trade. Edward L. Shaughnessy is Professor of Early China at the University of Chicago. His books include The Cambridge History of Ancient China.	2005-10-30	Duncan Baird						ZZZ000000

9781844076239	The Algal Bowl,Overfertilization of the World's Freshwaters and Estuaries	David W. Schindler&John R. Vallentyne		The greatest threat to water quality worldwide is nutrient pollution. Eutrophication by nutrients in sewage, fertilizers and detergents is feeding massive algal blooms in rivers, lakes and estuaries, choking out aquatic life and outpacing heavy metals, oil spills and other toxins in the devastation wrought upon the worldżs fresh waters. Renowned water scientists, David W. Schindler and John R. Vallentyne, share their combined 80 years of experience to explain its history and science, and offer real-world solutions for mitigating this catastrophe in the making. A long-awaited replacement for Vallentyneżs classic 1974 first edition, Schindlerżs fully revised edition has been expanded to cover estuaries as well as lakes. It is international in scope, drawing on examples including the North American Great Lakes, the Baltic Sea region in northern Europe and lakes in Asia and Africa. The book represents the most accessible and comprehensive overview of the key issues and will be invaluable for a broad range of students and professionals.	2008-09-01	Earthscan						ZZZ000000

9781849711500	The Atlas of Human Migration,Global Patterns of People on the Move	Russell King&Richard Black&Michael Collyer&Anthony J. Fielding&Ronald Skeldon		Migration has provided millions with an escape route from poverty or oppression, ensuring the survival, even prosperity, of individuals and their families. New currents of human migration, triggered by ethnic cleansing or climate change or economic need, are appearing all the time and immigration has become one of today's most contested issues. This compelling new atlas maps contemporary migration against its crucial economic, social, cultural and demographic contexts. Drawing on data from one of the largest concentrations of migration research, the atlas traces the story of migration from its historical roots through the economic and conflict imperatives of the last 50 years to the causes and effects of flight today.Issue covered include: " Refugees and asylum seekers" Diasporas" Remittances" The 'brain drain'" Trafficking " Student, retirement and return migration	2010	Earthscan						ZZZ000000

It covers a wide range of topics - from unfair detention and torture to racism, rape and child soldiers - and is divided into seven key parts:" State, identity and citizenship " Judicial violations and legal restrictions " Freedom of expression and censorship " Conflict and migration " Discrimination " Women's rights " Rights of the child	2010	Earthscan						ZZZ000000
9781853835445	Coming up from the streets,the story of The big issue	Tessa Swithinbank		The international success story of "The Big Issue" is both inspirational and paradoxical. It is not, as might be expected, a charity, it is a flourishing commercial enterprise, but one that genuinely and radically benefits the lives of those involved. The magazine is sold by homeless and vulnerable people and in return, they achieve financial independence and status and self-reliance. Swithinbank gives an eminently readable and interesting account of the development and rôle of "The Big Issue". This extraordinary story has a practical angle and will offer insight and help to NGOs and governments involved with the homeless or for those businesses wishing to set up an enterprise for the common good.	2001	Earthscan						ZZZ000000

9780340807804	Design and Analyse Your Experiment with Minitab	Tony Greenfield&Andrew V. Metcalfe		Progress in engineering and the physical sciences, agriculture and the biological sciences, and to some extent social science, depends on experiments. The design of such experiments is crucial. If they are poorly designed they will be inefficient and may lead to misleading conclusions. Nevertheless, many investigators and researchers in industry and universities are expected to design and analyze their own experiments. Even if investigators do have access to statistical advice, they will be expected to have some basic knowledge of the issues. This book aims to help. Covering all the most commonly used designs of experiments, the methods and the potential pitfalls are described in clear English. The techniques are introduced with case studies of practical significance. The cases are based on real experiments but are described in the context of three fictitious organizations: an engineering company, SeaDragon; a pharmaceuticals and chemicals manufacturer AgroPharm; and the Department of Social Studies at the University of Erewhon. All technical terms are defined and the mathematical development is restricted to that which is needed to use MINITAB.	2007-03-23	John Wiley & Sons						ZZZ000000

9780340914762	Theory of Knowledge	Nicholas Alchin		The Theory of Knowledge course is central to the philosophy of the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme. It encourages students to question the basis of knowledge and to develop the ability to evaluate critically information from a wide range of sources. Unlike most academic courses, where students are used to being given facts that they are expected to learn, in this course they are expected to question knowledge itself acirc;euro;" What do I know? How do I know it? Is it likely to be true or not? Questions that have interested people over the centuries include: What is good art?Can I trust my senses?Will science tell us everything?How did the Universe start?Is there life after death? Theory of Knowledge 2nd edition provides an introductory framework that looks at how to approach these and other questions. It covers ways to look for answers and highlights the problems that arise when we do so. To encourage this critical thinking and to stimulate discussion, this Student's Book also includes a wide range of material from other sources. This new edition includes a variety of new activities in each chapter plus a revised chapter on morality and two new chapters on truth and assessment. The accompanying Teacher's Book provides a model for the course and suggested teaching activities for each chapter.	2006-01-27	Hodder Murray						ZZZ000000

9781845119683	The Child in Film,Tears, Fears and Fairy Tales	Karen Lury		Ghastly and ghostly children, 'dirty little white girls', the child as witness and as victim, have always played an important part in the history of cinema, as have child performers themselves. In exploring the disruptive power of the child in films made for an adult audience across popular films, including 'Taxi Driver' and Japanese horror, and 'art-house' productions like 'Mirror' and 'Pan's Labyrinth', Karen Lury investigates why the figure of the child has such a significant impact on the visual aspects and storytelling potential of cinema. Lury's main argument is that the child as a liminal yet powerful agent has allowed filmmakers to play adventurously with cinema's formal conventions - with far-reaching consequences. In particular, she reveals how a child's relationship to time allows it to disturb and question conventional master-narratives. She explores too the investment in the child actor and expression of child sexuality, as well as how confining and conservative existing assumptions can be in terms of commonly held beliefs as to who children 'really are'.	2009-07-30	I B TAURIS						ZZZ000000
9781848850262	The Cult TV Book	Stacey Abbott		With the phenomenal success of such programmes as 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer', 'Lost', and 'Doctor Who', Cult TV is a very exciting area of contemporary television. 'The Cult TV Book' is designed to be the companion reference to this TV phenomenon, whose shows offer biting commentaries on society today. Cult TV is also changing; where in the past, being cult meant being marginal with a small, loyal fan base, today cult TV is key to the television industry, fandom is now global and energetically online, cult status is fostered by the networks, and cult shows are notable not for their low budgets and schlock, but for spectacular special effects and sumptuous visual style.	2010-03-10	I.

9781845119201	A swamp full of dollars,pipelines and paramilitaries at Nigeria's oil frontier	Michael Peel		Nigeria is a country where petroleum prices and polio are both booming, where small villages challenge giant oil companies, and scooter drivers run their own mini-state. The oil-rich Delta region at the heart of it all is, as Peel shows us, a troublespot as hot as the local pepper soup. Through a host of characters, from the prostitutes of Port Harcourt to the Area Boys of Lagos, from the militants in their swamp forest hide-outs to the oil company executives in London, Peel tells the story of this extraordinary country, which grows ever more wild and lawless by the day as its crude oil pumps through our cities. "Most Westerners are terrified of Nigeria. Journalist Michael Peel, in contrast, clearly revels in the countryżsrich chaos, savouring its driving energy and many contradictions. Plunging fearlessly into its oil-polluted swamps, hob-nobbing with guerrilla commandos, hearing the tales of trafficked prostitutes and Lagosż formidable area boys, he produces a detailed, compassionate portrait of a bubbling West African nation which is certain to demand ever more of our attention as the worldżs hunger for oil grows." - Michela Wrong 'Russia is an enigmatic petrochemical power with a population of 140 million; Nigeria is an enigmatic petrochemical power with a population of 140 million. Last year the British Library added almost 500 new Russia-related titles to its collection, and fewer than three dozen about Nigeria. For that reason alone Michael Peel's new book deserves a cheer" - James Meek, Guardian journalist and author of 'We Are Now Beginning Our Descent'.	2009-07-30	I.B. Tauris						ZZZ000000

As this nuclear power nation, the front line of the Westżs struggle against Al Qaeda, enters the worst political crisis in its history, Zahid Hussainżs acclaimed and updated book unravels the key questions: who really controls the country? Will Pakistan be Talibanized? Has Al Qaeda infilitrated the state? Hussain shows that whoever was behind Bhuttożs assassination, its main effect has been to accelerate the countryżs fragmentation, creating a level of uncertainty and chaos from which only extremists and terrorists can benefit. Whatever lies in wait for Pakistan - Talibanization, civil war or worse - it will have grave implications for the entire world. Well researched, well written, impeccably sourced and balanced, accurate, reliable, and above all, amazingly clear and comprehensible. Hussain has interviewed most of the principal players in the Government, the military and the jihadi groupsżUnlike many commentators on militant Islam, Hussain writes with nuance and understanding"	2008-01	I.

This book helps readers fend off negative people and attract positive people." ––Gavin de Becker, #1 New York Times bestselling author of The Gift of Fear and Fear Less "I feel a little strange recommending this book because it reveals so many of my secrets. Dr. Lillian Glass clearly and effectively communicates the complex subtleties of the human psyche. Understanding nonverbal language is the essential skill in any profession that involves communication. This book is the best primer on the topic of nonverbal communication I have ever read. Success as a trial attorney requires intuition and the ability to use it. However, most trial lawyers I know are unable to articulate how they do what they do with juries. Applying the knowledge contained in this book almost guarantees increased success." ––Geoffrey N. Fieger, noted trial attorney "As a regular contributor to and commentator on Court TV, Dr. Lillian Glass has repeatedly demonstrated her exceptional professional skills of reading people in our on-air coverage of several trials.

How wonderful it is to be able to read another person’s face, speech, and body movements to assist you in assessing that person’s integrity. Applause to Dr. Glass for giving the public such an important work." ––Arnold Kopelson, motion picture producer "You need to read people, especially now––whether you’re getting into a relationship, making a financial investment, or for your own safety. Since I’m a private investigator who has dealt with many celebrities over the years, if I hadn’t learned how to read people I’d be dead by now. In I Know What You’re Thinking, Dr. Lillian Glass shows you the secrets of reading people to improve every aspect of your life.

And how do those policies now fit with its overall foreign policy goals? This timely new book explores the complexities of Chinażs evolving relationship with the developing world.The authors first examine the political and economic implications of Chinażs efforts to be seen as a responsible great power. A series of comprehensive regional chapters then showcase a quid pro quo relationshipżvariously involving crucial raw materials, energy, and consumers on the one hand and infrastructure development, aid, and security on the other. The concluding chapter illuminates Chinażs search for national identity in the context of widespread suspicions of its strategic motives. The result is a thorough, yet accessible, view of an increasingly important topic in global affairs.	2010	Lynne Rienner Publishers						ZZZ000000

Does it make sense in today¿s security environment to use military force to achieve strategic objectives? How does the contemporary battlefield function? Addressing these questions, Simon Murden explores the contradictions inherent in attempting to combat global terrorist networks by intervening in complex, local social settings.Murden proposes two approaches to better understand the nature of contemporary warfare: one focusing on the nature of insurgency and the other on the dynamics of intervention. Applying these approaches to the cases of Iraq and Afghanistan, he offers important conclusions about the shortcomings of US strategy in the global war on terror.	2009-05-30	Lynne Rienner Publishers						ZZZ000000

9780658000737	The observational research handbook,understanding how consumers live with your product	Bill Abrams&American Marketing Association		The Observational Research Handbook explores the burgeoning qualitative marketing research technique of ethnography or "descriptive anthropology," the observation and analysis of how consumers respond to a product within their own environments based upon their cultural values and relationships. The most comprehensive professional reference available on the subject, The Observational Research Handbook acquaints marketing and advertising professionals, market researchers, and manufacturers of consumer products with what observational research is, what it can add to a consumer marketing effort, and how an ethnographic marketing study is conducted. The book includes insights on setting study objectives, selecting the appropriate research method, defining the parameters of a study, creating interview scripts, applying specific practices and tips to the actual observations, and then compiling and analyzing the results. A complete case study—featuring a real proposal for an observational research study as well as an actual script and analysis of the results—is included in the appendix. Praise for The Observational Research Handbook: "Building great brands means constantly fishing for new ideas with the power to move consumers. This book should be in every marketer's tackle box. Bill Abrams provides a guide to observational research that's fascinating and instructive. -- Elizabeth Ellers Director, Brand Planning & Research Grey Advertising "Bill Abrams takes a topic that is surrounded by academic mystery and makes it understandable and usable for people in business. The learning that Colgate has obtained from observing people shopping and using our products in their homes has been invaluable in designing new products that meet their needs. Observational research is a cornerstone of our consumer insights program." -- Jim Figura Vice President Consumer Research and Insights Colgate-Palmolive Company "Bill Abrams creative director turned observational research guru, opens your eyes to how you can determine how consumers actually relate to and use your product. When you finish the book, you will be a believer!" -- Charles D. Peebler Jr. Chairman Emeritus True North Communications	2000	McGraw-Hill Professional						ZZZ000000

9780335205134	Compassion, morality, and the media	Keith Tester		* Why do the reports and representations of suffering and misery move us? * What are we likely to do about it and why? * Why do people take part in telethon appeals? Most of us have watched television or read newspapers and been moved to compassion by the suffering and misery that we see. We know that many people suffer thanks to war, famine or environmental catastrophe. But what do the reports and representations of the suffering and misery of others actually mean to media users? Compassion, Morality and the Media seeks to answer this question and offers an engaging narrative through which it becomes possible to think about the role of journalists as moral agents. The author explores the tensions between the intentions of journalists, the horizons of the audience and the priorities of media institutions. This is a book which deals with important issues that have been relatively neglected in the academic study of the media. It is accessible and relevant and opens up a new terrain for research and teaching on the media as a moral force. Students taking undergraduate courses on the media and others with a wider interest in media morality will find it to be compelling reading.	2001-03-01	Open University						ZZZ000000

9788130911953	India China relations,the border issue and beyond	Mohan Guruswamy&Zorawar Daulet Singh		At the outset, this book must be viewed as a policy relevant document rather than an abstract historical research paper. The authors have revisited the seemingly intractable India-China border dispute from a contemporary conflict resolution perspective and thus are relatively detached from the historical baggage that has so often influenced other commentaries on this controversial subject. The great natural defensive line of northern India, the mighty Himalayas, separating Tibet from north-east India, is a barrier which, by tradition, was impenetrable. This defensive line is embodied by the 1914 Line, India s non-negotiable interest. Thus, from an Indian perspective, it can never be conceived that its frontiers with China are ever formalized on the Brahmaputra plains. Further, the 1914 alignment, aside from its strategic sanctity, also upholds the ethnic and linguistic affinities to peoples south of it, who are distinct from the homogenous Tibetan or Han people. Similarly, from China s perspective it too is in possession of its non-negotiable interest the Aksai Chin plateau. And therein lies the essence of an east-west swap. By retracing the historical record, the authors argue that such a swap is eminently feasible and historically justifiable. Moreover, realpolitik demands it. From the Indian perspective, however, it should be equally clear that a bipartisan national consensus is imperative for any breakthrough resolution to emerge. It remains to be seen, however, if political managers on both sides are able to muster the necessary will to resolve a dispute that has lasted for more than half-a-century.

9780393062250	Bubble man,Alan Greenspan & the missing 7 trillion dollars	Peter Hartcher		The destructive legacy of the most powerful man in the world: Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve. In this eye-opening account, Peter Hartcher reexamines the achievements of Alan Greenspan, the man who presided over the 1990s stock-market bubble—perhaps the biggest speculative frenzy in history—and walked away when it came crashing down, with his reputation apparently unscathed. The U.S. economy is still struggling with the fallout from Greenspan's tenure, which includes a bubble in housing prices, a rocky recovery, and a vast federal deficit. His mistakes live on, as does the question of what to do about bubbles. Hartcher's careful investigation of the most financially expensive event in American history results in a gripping tale of failed leadership, excess, and the bizarre politics behind the world's most powerful economy.	2006-04-25	W.

With hundreds of original texts and an ocean of books, the task can be daunting—but this manual offers a contemporary, accessible approach to the traditional wisdom. Basing its approach on the Tree of Life, The Kabbalah Experience leads readers through a series of structured exercises designed to spur self-revelation, and integrates elements of the Tarot with traditional Judaic teachings for a more complete understanding of the Kabbalah. It’s a valuable companion for any journey into the mysteries of this popular spiritual path.	2005-09-12	Watkins						ZZZ000000

9781842930939	This is it,dialogues on the nature of oneness	Jan Kersschot&Tony Parsons&Eckhart Tolle		Everything you need to know, you know already. That’s the message Jan Kerschott brings seekers who have been desperately trying to “find themselves,” but still have not achieved a sense of well-being. In fact, the desperate struggle to reach enlightenment can actually be counterproductive, increasing feelings of alienation. Through conversations with some of today's foremost spiritual guides, including Eckhart Tolle (author of The Power of Now), Douglas Harding (author of the acclaimed On Having No Head), Nathan Gill, Chuck Hillig, Wayne Liquorman, and others, this inspirational study offers reassurance that everything is exactly how it is supposed to be…and teaches us to accept that truth.	2006-07-28	Watkins						ZZZ000000

Also included are extracts from the later Mahayana sutras, traditional Buddhist tales and fascinating koans (riddles) from Zen masters. Introductory passages of commentary illuminate key meanings. The book's ten chapters mirror stages of the Buddha's healing role, from diagnosis (starting with the chain of causation) to cure (ending with enlightenment). Rooted in knowledge acquired thousands of years ago in the foothills of the Himalayas, the insights of the Buddha remain just as relevant today, because the issues we encounter in our search for true happiness are universal and timeless.	2009-08-03	Duncan Baird Publishers						ZZZ000000

9781861976062	Economics,making sense of the modern economy	Simon Cox		Written in the accessible, intelligent, jargon-free style for which "The Economist" is famous, this book is aimed at anyone - from students to presidents - who wants to make sense of the modern economy and grasp how economic theory works in practice.  The laws of economics do not change from week to week. If you have ever wondered why America's trade deficit attracts so much fuss, why central bankers enjoy so much deference, whether stockbrokers earn their commissions, or why we cannot share unemployment by sharing work out more evenly, the articles in this book provide answers based on economic principles of lasting relevance.  Part one of the book looks at globalisation. Part two track the fortunes of the world economy - America's recovery and its imbalances; China's rise; and the brighter signs for the Japanese and German economies after years of underachievement. Part three examines the "capital" in capitalism - what finance does for the economy; how money and credit are created, regulated and circulated; and capial flows across national borders. Part four explores how economics is applied and misapplied - what the market can achieve and how it can fail.	2006-09-01	Bloomberg Press						ZZZ000000

This volume summarizes the main lectures presented at the Osaka University Macromolecular Symposium OUMS '98 on Molecular Interactions and Time-Space Organization in Macromolecular Systems, where the following topics were discussed:crystallization kinetics, liquid crystals, phase separation, gelation, adhesion, complex formation, and self-organization, with emphasis on molecular interactions. Both these topics are hot issues at present and frequently are taken up as a main theme at a particular symposium. The present symposium invited leading theorists and experimentalists in these fields as guest speakers and is expected to attract the interest of a significant range of readers.	1999	Springer-Verlag						ZZZ000000

9781844834457	Chakra Meditation	Swami Saradananda	Hardcover	In Indian healing philosophy, chakras are the seven energy centres running from the base of the spine to the crown of the head. Each is a hub for the vital energy that flows through the body. If the energy at these centres becomes blocked, emotional and physical health can suffer.

9788130914954	Surviving a Stroke	Mike Ripley	Paperback	Review"A must read for anyone who wants to survive a stroke with their sense of humour intact. Its a measure of Ripleys courage and writing ability that he treats his sling and arrows of outrageous fortune with such an enviable lightness of touch".  Minette Walters "Stroke is by its nature an isolating disease. In the first instance it isolates you as a person from your brain, then from parts of your body, your memory, your ability to communicate, your capacity to understand what is happening. The effect of this is to isolate you from your family and loved ones, your work, your social life, your life outside your home or a hospital ward. It is the cruellest and loneliest of afflictions." In January 2003, at the age of 50, Mike Ripley had a stroke. This is his story of the stroke itself and the next year in the recovery process, together with loads of practical tips and advice for anyone else recovering from a stroke  Coping with memory loss, slow thought processes, clumsiness, vertigo and other long term effects of a stroke  Dealing with depression and the emotional aftermath  Learning to live with hypertension and how to reduce your blood pressure  Finding the right medication As a comic crime thriller writer, Mike Ripley looks for the humour in any situation, and finds it even in this one. About Author: Mike Ripley is the author of 16 novels, including the award-winning Angel series of comic thrillers. He is well known as a critic and reviewer of crime fiction and was also a scriptwriter for the BBCs Lovejoy series. He was four years into a new career as an archaeologist when he had his stroke.	2010	CRIMSON PUBLISHING	148	Enghish				ZZZ000000
