9788125031574	The burden of refuge,the Sindhi Hindus of Gujarat	Rita Kothari		The Burden Of Refuge Tells The Story Of The Sindhi Hindus Of Gujarat Beginning With Colonial Sindh And Tracing The Socio-Political Dynamics Of The Pre-Partition Days. Through Personal Narratives, Kothari Brings To Life The Story Of Various Sindhis As They Migrate To India And Begin Their Process Of Resettlement. She Delineates The Contexts That Made An Atypical Community Like The Sindhis Re-Modify Themselves To Suit More Textbook Notions Of Gujarati Bourgeois Society. In Their Desire To Assimilate With India (Especially Gujarat), The Sindhis Gained Much, But Also Suffered Many Losses. Though Sindhis Have Risen From The Ashes Of Partition As A Model Immigrant Community, The Sufi Syncreticism That Informed Their Former Life Has Been Tragically Damaged And They Have Also Suffered The Loss Of Their Language. In Gujarat, These Losses Are Accompanied With A Desire To Become Proper Hindus By Adopting A More Monolithic Hindu Identity And By Denying Their Sindhiness . Using Intergenerational Voices And Combining History With Personal Narratives, Kothari S Book Examines The Phenomena Of Psychological Violence During And After Partition, And Explores A Different Facet Of Partition Studies. Going Beyond Partition Studies, This Book Also Makes An Important Contribution To The Area Of Identity Politics In Contemporary India. This Multidisciplinary Study Is Relevant To Everyone Interested In India S Past And Present.	2007	Orient Longman						ZZZ000000

9788125039204	Hundred Tamil Folk And Tribal Tales	Sujatha Vijayaraghavan		In Hundred Tamil Folk and Tribal Tales we have a rich variety of tale-types of a major South Indian oral tradition. Sujatha Vijayaraghavan s lucid English translation here beacons a serious engagement in Indic studies. It locates this body of work at the interface between folklore, anthropology, sociology and public culture of a by-gone era. This handy collection provides an easy access to the cultural registers and linguistic mores of a tribal/folk population at a crucial juncture of colonial modernity. Furthermore, she translates not merely the tales as she finds them in the Tamil original (naatupura kathai kalanjiyam), but distinguishes and recognises the tribal tale, otherwise unnoticed in a proverbial ocean of Indian folklore. As a vibrant vein of wit and wisdom in Dravidian lives and traditions, the tribal-tale receives the first-ever straight look in these pages.	2010	Orient BlackSwan						ZZZ000000

9780025160064	Looking Through Glass	Mukul Kesavan		Looking through Glass is a powerful and immensely entertaining novel set in the troubled 1940s - the era of India's partition and independence. Its narrator is our contemporary, an ambitious young photographer properly unconcerned with history. But history makes him her own - in a literal way - when he finds himself suddenly transported into the deep end of 1942. His involuntary odyssey through a crumbling Raj takes him from Muslim neighborhoods and coffee shops to Hindu wrestling academies to colonial enclaves of viceregal splendor. He meets change-mongering nationalists, but also Ammi, founder of the Society for the Defense of the Present; Gyanendra, a pioneering pornographer; and even his own grandmother, whom he cremated long before. Stuck, like the rest of us, in a time and place not of his choosing, he does the usual things: He improvises a life and assembles a world - one bound by affection, not ideology. And as he struggles to sidestep the juggernaut that will irrevocably divide Hindus and Muslims, we discover, often with a terrible poignancy, how much of what came to be in India need not have been.	1996-04	Orient Blackswan						ZZZ000000

9780521259866	Muslim Endowments and Society in British India	Gregory C. Kozlowski		Dr Kozlowski's important study pioneers a fresh approach to the study of a critical Muslim institution: the endowments or awqaf which almost everywhere in the Islamic world provide support for mosques, schools and shrines. The wealthier Muslims who establish endowments inevitably have an eye on social, political and economic conditions and have traditionally used awqaf as part of an effort to preserve their wealth and influence, especially in periods of change and uncertainty. The book focuses on the use of endowments by Muslims suffering the dislocations caused by the imposition of British rule in India and examines in detail the social and political implications of the controversy over endowments that took place in the imperial courts and councils. The author's observations and insights can be applied to many periods and places in the Muslim world and his novel approach will attract all those interested in the study of Islam.	2008-10-30	Cambridge University Press						ZZZ000000

9780521263146	The Untouchable as himself,ideology, identity, and pragmatism among the Lucknow Chamars	Ravindra S. Khare		The world of the Indian Untouchable is often invisible behind that of the dominant Hindu caste, but it is of no less significance for the understanding of contemporary Indian society. The Untouchables, like the caste Hindu, have been substantially affected by the political, economic and social changes that are occurring in independent India. While India has legally abolished untouchability, the society scarcely has and the Untouchables continue to face social resistance and deprivation. However, the changing social circumstances have given rise to a new awareness and increased expectations among the Untouchables and, although their social achievements may have been limited, they are engaged in a process of questioning and reformulating old definitions of self and society. This book is a study of the new frame of mind of the Untouchable. The work presents a complete discussion of the value structure and meaning of Untouchable ideology. It is a subtle combination of sensitive ethnographic data, taken from a field study of the Chamars of Lucknow, with an analysis of Untouchable accounts of their perceptions and experiences expressed in their own terms and a penetrating interpretation of wider cultural concepts.	1984	CUP Archive						ZZZ000000

9780582073852	The East India Company,a history	Philip Lawson		This is the first short history of the East India Company - the trading company that became an imperial power - to be designed for student and academic use. It covers the Company's entire history from its foundation through to its demise after the Indian Mutiny in 1857, paying particular attention to the Company's important but often neglected early years. An important contribution to both Anglo-Indian and imperial historiography, it also reflects the very lively state of scholarship in both fields today. The East India Company received its charter from parliament in 1600 for the monopoly of trade in the eastern hemisphere. Unable to compete with the Dutch in the East Indies themselves, the Company soon came to concentrate its energies on trade with India. Its growing regional influence - mercantile, political and military - led to clashes with the French, who had expansionist ambitions of their own. The campaigns of 1745-61, culminating in Clive's spectacular victories, made the Company the dominant power in India. It remained in essential control of the subcontinent until the upheaval of the Mutiny, in the aftermath of which the Crown assumed direct government of India in 1858. The crucial role that the East India Company played in the development of British overseas expansion is fully surveyed here by Philip Lawson; but he breaks new ground in also analysing the impact that the Company's developing role had on Britain itself. He throws new light on the global imperatives affecting policy decisions in London, as well as the diplomatic complexities under which the Company operated in India. He also shows that the dynamic by which the Company acquired its imperial role was not always inthe interests of the state, the Company, India or the East Indies: the progress, profitability and even the viability of the Company were frequently compromised by destructive internal forces, like political corruption and militarism, long before its formal demise.

9788125030614	Education and social change in South Asia	Krishna Kumar&Joachim Oesterheld&Nishat Amin&Zentrum Moderner Orient (Berlin&Germany)		Today education is a key factor for further development of most of the countries in South Asia, which after decades of independence are still lacking in literacy. The book focuses on the relationship between the state and society of South Asian countries, especially in the field of primary education. After dealing with developments under colonial rule, the major part of the contributions is devoted to the educational policy in South Asian countries post-independence. The papers reveal the relevance and crucial role of culture, religion, and ethnicity for imparting basic education on a nation-wide scale. Taking into consideration the complexity of societies of South Asian countries, the book looks at the social and political implications arising out of the educational policy of the state for the process of nation building. The book is a specific contribution from a South Asian context to the ongoing debate about the relevance of language, culture, and religion in the educational policy of a majority population and its impact on minority communities.	2007	Orient Longman						ZZZ000000

9788178242637	Schooling India	Vronique Benei		This book explores an important yet often overlooked aspect of nationalism its embodied and emotional dimensions. It does so by focusing on a neglected area, that of elementary education in the modern state. Through an ethnographic study of primary schools in western India, Véronique Benei examines the idioms through which teachers, students, and parents make meaning of their political world. She articulates how urban middle- and lower-class citizens negotiate the processes of self-making through the minutiae of daily life at school and extracurricular activities, ranging from school trips to competitions and parent gatherings. To document how processes of identity formation are embodied, Benei draws upon historical and cultural repertoires of emotionality and language-use. Her book shifts the normal focus of attention away from apocalyptic communal violence she looks instead at everyday or banal nationalism . Attentive to the formulation of senses of belonging , she explores the sensory production and daily manufacture of nationhood and citizenship, as well as how nationalism is nurtured in a nation s youth. Historians, sociologists, students of politics and nationalism as well as educationists will be enriched by this careful and detailed study of the often ignored nuances involved in the making of communities such as Hindus and Muslims within the framework of the Indian nation.	2008	Permanent Black						ZZZ000000
