9780385237840	The Art of War	Sun Tzu&Sunzi&James Clavell		If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle....These are the words of ancient Chinese philosopher Sun Tzu, whose now-classic treatise, The Art of War, was written more than 2,500 years ago. Originally a text for victory on the battlefield, the book has vastly transcended its original purpose.Here is a seminal work on the philosophy of successful leadership that is as applicable to contemporary business as it is to war. Today many leading American business schools use the text as required reading for aspiring managers, and even Oliver Stone's award-winning film Wall Street cites The Art of War as a guide to those who strive for success.Now acclaimed novelist James Clavell, for whom Sun Tzu's writing has been an inspiration, gives us a newly edited Art of War. Author of the best-selling Asian saga consisting of Shogun, Tai-Pan, Gai-jin, King Rat, Noble House, and Whirlwind, Clavell first heard about Sun Tzu in Hong Kong in 1977, and since then The Art Of War has been his constant companion--he refers to it frequently in Noble House. He has taken a 1910 translation of the book and clarified it for the contemporary reader. This new edition of The Art Of War is an extraordinary book made even more relevant by an extraordinary editor.From the Trade Paperback edition.	1983-03-10	eBookEden.com						ZZZ000000

And how about the times she and her girlfriends baked chocolate-chip cookies or, later, prepared elaborate dinners to impress potential husbands? One day when looking through an old desk she'd bought as a newlywed thirty years earlier, food writer and restaurant critic Sharon Boorstin discovered a notebook of recipes she'd collected from her mother, relatives, and girlfriends at the time. It inspired her to reconnect with the recipe givers -- some of whom she hadn't seen in years -- and to explore the power of cooking and food in establishing bonds among women.  Let Us Eat Cake celebrates these connections. As a young girl, Boorstin helped her mother make tuna casseroles; on a college trip to Europe, she and her girlfriends compared men and restaurants with equal zest; after she became a food writer, Boorstin bonded with women in the food world including Barbara Lazaroff (Mrs. Wolfgang) Puck, the Too Hot Tamales, and Julia Child. Today, after decades of enjoying food and cooking together, Boorstin and the women in her life have come to understand what truly makes for female friendships. With dozens of delicious recipes and vintage photos, this moving book will inspire readers to remember and cherish their own experiences with food, family, and friends.	2003-06-05	HarperCollins						ZZZ000000
9780060081195	Mr. Lincoln's Wars,A Novel in Thirteen Stories	Adam Braver		In this highly ambitious collection, Adam Braver explores Abraham Lincoln's inner life and personal turmoils -- while also reflecting on the indelible impact Lincoln had on the nation during the last year of his presidency. Braver brings the president to life, not just as the strong and resilient leader of history books but also as a grief-stricken father, heartbroken over the loss of his young son. Across a rich canvas of truth and imagination, Mr. Lincoln's Wars reveals a president within the White House walls. We see Lincoln as he explores the meaning of loss through a chance encounter with the father of a slain soldier. And a good-hearted young Union soldier is quickly turned into a killer in the name of President Lincoln. Finally, there is the assassination and the autopsy, as seen through the eyes of John Wilkes Booth, Mary Lincoln, the assistant surgeon general, and one of Lincoln's closest friends. Brilliant in its depiction of the country during the waning days of the war, this book is an insightful and moving exploration of the myth of celebrity and the passions it arouses. More than anything, Mr. Lincoln's Wars introduces a talented new writer whose storytelling ability knows no bounds.	2004-01-19	HarperCollins						ZZZ000000

All of these methods can work, but they're all time-consuming and haphazard.   What if you need someone to draw some salad on a plate with a glass on wine next to it? You could go through the above processes, and -- after a while -- you'd probably find someone to draw or paint it in the style you wanted. Or you could pick up The Big Book of Illustration Ideas. Flip to the section marked "Food and Still Life" and find pages and pages of illustrators who can draw all manner of food in all manner of styles: pencil, crayon, watercolor, collage, and so on, and so on. A smorgasbord of illustration ideas! In fact, within these pages, you'll find the best illustrators, from all over the world, found together in one place along with all their contact details.   For ease of reference, illustrators' work is cataloged by theme: People; Portraits; Food and Still Life; Buildings; Landscapes; Abstract Concepts; Diagrams; and Miscellaneous. Each section shows hundreds of examples to allow a quick and accurate list of illustrators suited to your needs.	2006-03-02	Collins Design						ZZZ000000
9780060858292	The Gospel of Jesus,A Historical Search for the Original Good News	James McConkey Robinson		We all know the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, but what was the gospel of Jesus? That is, what was the original "good news" the first disciples heard from Jesus? What did Jesus really say that started the dramatic movement in Galilee that grew to become the largest religion in the world?  Jesus's original gospel has been lost from sight, hidden behind the version preferred by the church. We have put him on a pedestal, rather than walked in his footsteps. In The Gospel of Jesus, James M. Robinson, the preeminent expert on the earliest sources of information about Jesus, provides the primary texts in all their unvarnished honesty to get to the true historical message of Jesus -- what Robinson calls "a brittle, upsetting, comforting, challenging gospel." The Gospel of Jesusdraws on a combination of the most ancient and authentic texts to reveal what Jesus really said and to illuminate what he may still have to say to us today.  Robinson addresses such provocative questions as:   What can we know about Jesus's childhood  and youth? What was his family like? What sort of education did he receive? How observant a Jew was he? What do we know about his sex life? What do we know about his relation to Mary Magdalene? What was John the Baptist's impact on him? What message did Jesus really preach? What do we know about his crucifixion? Why did his followers believe so fervently in his resurrection?  Drawing on the earliest Gospel, Mark, plus the source for Matthew and Luke, known as "Q," as well as from Jewish sources such as the Dead Sea Scrolls and the ancient extra-biblical Gnostic texts discovered at Nag Hammadi, Robinson not only reconstructs the good news Jesus preached and practiced two thousand years ago, but shows how relevant his message still is -- and how we can apply it to our lives today. The Gospel of Jesus offers one of the most authentic and stirring accounts ever written of the message preached by the figure whose followers today number more than two billion.	2006-08-24	HarperCollins Publishers						ZZZ000000

9780060934446	The Night Abraham Called to the Stars,Poems	Robert Bly&Robert W. Bly		Robert Bly's new collection of poetry is made of forty-eight poems written in the intricate form called the ghazal, which is the central poetic form in Islam. The influence of Hafez and Rumi is clear, and yet the poems descend into the wealth of Western history, referring at times to Monet, Giordano Bruno,Emerson, St. Francis, Newton, and Chekhov, as well as to events in Bly's own life. The leaping between joy and "ruin" produces a poetry which makes him, as Kenneth Rexroth noted, "one of the leaders in a poetic revival which has returned American literature to the world community."	2002-03-21	HarperCollins						ZZZ000000

Days before Owsley was scheduled to study the skeleton, the government seized it to bury Kennewick Man's bones on the land of the Native American tribes who claimed him. Along with other leading scientists, Owsley sued the U.S. government over custody. Concerned that knowledge about our past and our history would be lost forever if the bones were reburied, Owsley fought a legal and political battle for six years, putting everything at risk, jeopardizing his career and his reputation.	2004-04-01	HarperCollins						ZZZ000000

9780753411193	Like father, like son?,12 stories about boys and their dads	Tony Bradman		Top Writers On A Top Theme. Relationships between fathers and sons can be strong and rewarding on both sides, but males in general can get a bad press - absent fathers, violent young men, boys doing badly at school in comparison to their female peers. The key factor is a perceived lack of male role models - of good fathers and fathering - for boys as they grow up. These brilliant stories explore relationships between fathers and sons with comedy, wisdom and, above all, riveting entertainment. Read about boys and dads in ordinary families, about boys whose dads are absent for one reason or another - through divorce or separation, but also because of work or migration. There are stories about a boy who desperately wants a dad, tales about demanding dads, competitive dads, distant, unemotional dads, dads who try too hard, dads who have favourites among their children, and of course stepdads. This unique collection is a perfect choice for boys aged 9-14, giving them top writers on a top theme.	2006-05-15	Kingfisher						ZZZ000000

9780765340009	The Road to Santa Fe	Norman Zollinger		Enrique "Rick" Garcia, district attorney in the small New Mexico county of Chupadera, is a man of principle, a strange breed in the rough-and-tumble politics of his state. When he is tapped to run for governor, he will learn just how rocky the road to Santa Fe really is.He has a mortal enemy in Stanford Brown, a wealthy rancher Garcia convicted of manslaughter. From his prison cell Brown promises revenge on his former college football teammate. All through his campaign Garcia has been guided and encouraged by Ashley McCarver, an attorney and state Democratic Party operative. Ashley's relationship to her candidate evolves from campaign manager for a man she admires into an abiding love for him. Garcia, still haunted by the suicide of his wife, at first sees in Ashley only her professionalism and encyclopedic knowledge of state politics, but the election draws the pair inexorably together: after Garcia's political triumph the two marry. Meanwhile, Stanford Brown, freed from prison through a gubernatorial pardon granted by Garcia's predecessor, begins to unfold an elaborate and cunning plot to have his rival impeached. Will this attempt to jeopardize Garcia's political life become a serious threat? And will this shadow from the past cement or destroy his burgeoning relationship with Ashley?Meticulously researched by a master historical novelist, The Road to Santa Fe demonstrates Norman Zollinger's skill in creating three-dimensional contemporary characters. He also brings to life the complicated behind-the-scenes machinations of the strange world of New Mexico politics.	2009-03-31	Forge						ZZZ000000

9781400040803	The squandering of America,how the failure of our politics undermines our prosperity	Robert Kuttner		The incomes of most Americans today are static or declining. Tens of millions of workers are newly vulnerable to layoffs and outsourcing. Health care and retirement burdens are increasingly being shifted from employers to individuals. Two-income families find they are working longer hours for lower wages, with decreased social support. As wealth has become more concentrated, the economy has become more recklessly speculative, jeopardizing not only the prospects of ordinary Americans, but the solvency of the entire system. What links these trends, writes Robert Kuttner in this provocative, engaging, and necessary book, is the consolidation of political and economic power by a narrow elite, who blocks the ability of government to restore broad prosperity to the majority of citizens. Kuttnerone of our most lucid economic criticsexplores the roots of these problems and outlines a persuasive, bold alternative. InBusinessWeek,The Boston Globe, andThe American Prospect, he has established himself as a prophetic voice connecting economics and politics. Here he demonstrates how our economy has fallen hostage to a casino of financial speculation, creating instability as well as inequality. He debunks alarmist claims about supposed economic hazards, such as Social Security and Medicare, and exposes the genuine dangers: hedge funds and private equity run amok, sub-prime lenders, Wall Street middlemen, and America's dependence on foreign central banks. He describes how globalization of commerce has been used by business less to promote free trade than to escape the balanced regulation that delivered widespread abundance in the decades after World War II. While our financial security has weakened under President George W. Bush, Kuttner also faults many Democrats for failing to offer compelling alternatives. Now, with financial markets in crisis and public opinion supporting a more active role for government, he offers a new model of managed capitalism that can deliver security and opportunity, and rekindle democracy as a check on concentrated wealth. Here is a passionate, articulate naming of the problem and a call for reform.The Squandering of Americasets out a path for reclaiming our democratic politicsand our prosperity.	2007-11-06	Alfred A.

9781416527695	State of Denial,Bush at War	Bob Woodward		In his unmissable new book Bob Woodward takes the reader on an inside journey from the start of the Iraq War in 2003 right up to the present day, providing a detailed, authoritative account of President Bush's leadership and the struggles among the men and women in the White House, the Pentagon, the CIA and the State Department. With Bush well into his second term, Woodward breaks new ground, as he has in his thirteen previous international bestsellers, including BUSH AT WAR and PLAN OF ATTACK. Woodward puts the Bush legacy in historical context as he shows this presidency in action in a way that is normally seen only years after a chief executive leaves office. He describes how Bush and his team have attempted to change the way that wars are fought, and put together a re-election campaign while re-inventing their strategy for the invasion and occupation of Iraq over and over again. Here is the behind-the-scenes story of this administration -- meetings, conversations, and memos; conflicts, manoeuvring, and anguish -- as key administration figures provide a full view of the first presidency of the twenty-first century.	2007	Pocket						ZZZ000000
9781416544173	The carrot principle,how the best managers use recognition to engage their people, retain talent, and accelerate performance	Adrian Gostick&Chester Elton		A successful business culture is not created by the CEO or HR department but by one manager at a time. A nationwide statistical study by the Jackson Organization, unveiled here for the first time, reveals that managers rated as "very effective" at recognition by their employees were also recognized as communicators, team-builders, and goal setters. Bottom line: the most successful business leaders use carrots, not sticks. The Carrot Principle illustrates how ordinary organizations can make themselves extraordinary. Based on case studies from some of the world's most successful companies, such as DHL, Avis, and Pepsi, Adrian Gostick and Chester Elton demonstrate how praise and recognition lead to improved employee commitment and bottom line results. Filled with practical how-tos and real-life examples of the carrot principle in action, this modern day classic shows managers how they can make themselves not just better liked, but more effective.	2007-01-31	Simon & Schuster, Limited						ZZZ000000

9781847370631	Light on Distant Hills,A Memoir	Cathal O'Searcaigh		LIGHT ON DISTANT HILLS is poet Cathal O'Searcaigh's memoir of his childhood in rural Donegal. A remarkably lyrical telling by one of Ireland's favourite poets, this memoir is Cathal's first work of prose in English. Cathal grew up in the 1950s and 60s on the harsh peaty acres of a Donegal hill farm, where his illiterate mother believed in the fairies and knew more about their movements than of their own neighbours. The locals were an assortment of odd characters too, from artists, drunken randy farmers to the all-conquering parish priest. Growing up with Gaelic as his first language, Cathal began to understand the excitement of linking images with words and creating poetry. Throughout all this time, with his father working away in Scotland and his mother keeping the farm together, Cathal had free rein for adventure. He sensitively describes how he discovers he is gay and his first sexual experience with an older boy. Needing to earn money and broaden his horizons, Cathal moves to London to work in a bar. His delicate rendering of this harsh and sometimes violent world is beautifully wrought. The book ends with Cathal's journey turning back towards home and his acceptance of living amongst his own people once again.	2009-09-17	Simon & Schuster, Limited						ZZZ000000

Her parents are unable to care for her, so she is banished to a strict orphanage, along with children born outside marriage. At school, Leila and her best friend Amal are called 'daughters of sin'. Her pretty sister, Zulima, is married off to a much older man, while the nannies say an abandoned girl is lucky to get an offer of marriage at all. At the age of ten, both Leila and Amal endure female circumcision. Suffering appalling prejudice, and thought to bring the 'evil eye', Leila remains outgoing and brave and manages to get an education. She goes on to marry, have four children, and divorce, yet even grown up she continues to know the stigma of being abandoned. Undaunted, Leila founds her own charity to help those shunned as outcasts. Yet her charity work makes her vulnerable in the ultra-conservative Islamic society of Sudan, but she continues to work tirelessly to dispel prejudice. This beautifully written, graceful memoir perfectly evokes the heat and colour of the North African desert and tells of the true friendships that are born out of adversity.	2009-08-03	Simon & Schuster						ZZZ000000

9781847391315	The Measure of a Man,A Memoir	Sidney Poitier		In this beautifully written, candid memoir, legendary actor Sidney Poitier reveals the spiritual depth, passion and intellectual fervour that has driven his remarkable life. Poitier credits his childhood of poverty on idyllic Cat Island in the Bahamas for equipping him with the unflinching sense of self-worth, family values and simple ethics that he has never since surrendered and that have dramatically shaped his world. Just a few years after his introduction to indoor plumbing and the automobile, Poitier broke countless barriers to launch a pioneering career portraying important, dignified characters in some of the most morally significant films of the late 20th century. His engaging memoir spans a time in American history from segregation, through the early Civil Rights conflicts, to present-day cultural struggles. Poitier shares his provocative thoughts on racism in Hollywood, consumerism and the media, illness and mortality, honouring a higher consciousness and paying the price for artistic integrity. This book is a powerful testament to the rewards of being true to one's self, acting passionately on one's convictions and boldly walking on the edge.	2007-04-02	Simon & Schuster, Limited						ZZZ000000

Then Kaye, drunk on faerie wine and goaded by malicious ill-wishers, makes a passionate declaration -- in public -- which makes their situation immeasurably worse. Because of it Roiben must set her a task which she must complete to show that she is worthy to be his consort. The quest he gives her, however, is an impossible one: to find him a faery who can lie. Devastated as she is by his rejection, belonging neither in Faerie nor the human world -- Ironside -- Kaye is not the only one in trouble. Corny too has acted rashly and has to face some harsh and unpleasant consequences when he is cursed so that every thing he touches decays and dies. Together they set out to seek an answer and a cure, and both find more than they bargain for. Corny finds a soulmate in the mysterious and taciturn Luis -- whom he dare not touch -- but Kaye uncovers a plot to destroy Roiben once and for all by an act of exquisite cruelty and revenge. A plot hatched not in the twisted heart of the Unseelie Court but by the Seelie Queen herself: the bright star, Silarial, to whom Roiben in turn had once declared his love. Love and hate and good and evil are only sides of the same coin. But which is which and how fine is the line that lies between them?	2009-08-03	POCKET BOOKS						FIC009000

9781847398628	Darkness Descending - the Murder of Meredith Kercher	Paul Russell&Graham Johnson&Luciano Garofano		It was a brutal murder, and the trial of the decade. On 1 November 2007, 21-year-old British student Meredith Kercher was slaughtered in cold blood in the apartment in Perugia, Italy, that she shared with three other girls. Two bright young people, Amanda Knox and her Italian ex-boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito, stood accused of the killing in a trial that lasted through 2009. They were found guilty and sentenced to twenty-six and twenty-five years respectively on 4 December. A second man, Ivory Coast-born Rudy Guede, 22, had already been found guilty of the sexual assault and murder of Meredith in a separate trial in 2008 and sentenced to thirty years, but the prosecution always stated that he didn't act alone. Kercher was a model student whilst American Knox acquired a reputation that fuelled specualtion about her character. Her bizarre behaviour just after Meredith's body was found, her false accusation of an innocent man, her weak alibi and her DNA on the murder weapon - a kitchen knife found to be scubbed with bleach - went against her. TV producer Paul Russell and critically acclaimed crime writer Graham Johnson have teamed up with leading Italian forensics expert General Luciano Garofano to reveal the full truth behind this sensational murder and its trial. They unravel all the details and study all the personalities in this case that has stunned the world. Complex, and some say controversial, DNA evidence is explained in simple language and, bit by bit, a story emerges of brutality and jealousy in a university town where all was not what it seemed. Their findings make for gripping, sensational reading.	2010-05-03	POCKET BOOKS						ZZZ000000

The two of them have different goals, but the physical paths they follow are very similar.Before leaving Lahore, Kim is entrusted by one of his father's friends to deliver a very special message. Through this he meets a member of the British Secret Service and discovers secrets he couldn't have imagined. As the story progresses and his journey continues, Kim begins to learn more and more about what is known as the Great Game.As we follow Kim, we see him transformed from a simple vagabond into a sharpened operative in the dangerous world of politics, betrayal and death. All the excitement of Kim's adventures takes place in the backdrop of a beautiful country full of amazing sights, incredible sounds and an extremely rich culture.In what is considered by many to be Kipling's finest work, he draws on his own experiences of living in India to tell an unforgettable and action-packed story within a vivid and accurate setting.	2009-01-01	Campfire						ZZZ000000

9780060823764	Serving Two Masters?,Reflections on God and Profit	C. William Pollard		William Pollard draws upon his spiritual and practical insights––and those of other business and thought leaders––to show readers that principles of faith and smart business practices are not mutually exclusive, but can unite to strengthen corporate culture and lead to extraordinary financial success.  Imagine you are a manager at a large company. You stay current with the latest thinking in business management and leadership. You are up on the trends in sales and operations. But for the wealth of resources available, you haven't found much support in answering some of the most important questions about your business life: How can I manage the tension of living an authentic faith while delivering ever–increasing business results? Is there meaning in my work beyond making a living? How can I understand the world of money and profit in the context of my faith or a purpose and meaning for life? Who's been there before me?  Unlike the religious or faith–oriented books on the subject, Serving Two Masters provides practical insights from people who don't just read Fortune or The Wall Street Journal, but who are quoted in them. Drawn from over forty years of executive experience, Pollard's reflections will speak to everyone who has wrestled with the integration of faith and work as well as provice practical management and leadership insights taken straight from the real–world issues ServiceMaster faced when the firm was recognized by Fortune magazine as the nation's top service company.	2006-04-20	Collins						ZZZ000000

And just about every woman, at some point in her life, has encountered one–or many.Women everywhere will see themselves in these witty, wise, and entertaining personal essays by some of the literary world’s most accomplished and bestselling authors, including Jane Smiley, Audrey Niffennegger, Jacquelyn Mitchard, Ntozake Shange, Roxana Robinson, Marge Piercy, and Ann Hood.

If you’ve ever trusted a man you couldn’t trust, Mr. Wrong will make you laugh, cry, and shake your head in recognition at yourself and your friends.	2007-01-23	Ballantine Books						ZZZ000000

9780060535353	Threads,My Life Behind the Seams in the High-Stakes World of Fashion	Joseph Abboud&Ellen Stern		Designers are great white sharks, and we roam the waters ourselves. We often pretend to like and admire each other, but sometimes we don't even bother to fake it. The fashion industry is as hardworking, incestuous, and political as any other, and it's virtually impossible, given the size of designers' egos, to sincerely wish someone else well, because behind every false tribute is 'It should have been me.' So writes Joseph Abboud, who fell in love with style at five. There in the dark of the movie house, he wasn't just some Lebanese kid with a babysitter. He was the hero, in tweeds and pocket squares. That's where he learned that clothes represented a better life—a life he wanted, and would grab, for himself. From his blue-collar childhood in Boston's South End to his spread-collar success as one of America's top designers, he has forged a remarkable path through the unglamorous business of making people look glamorous. He transformed American menswear by replacing the traditional stiff-shouldered silhouette with a grown-up European sensuality. He was the first designer to win the coveted CFDA award as Best Menswear Designer two years in a row and the first designer to throw out the opening pitch at Fenway Park. He's been jilted by Naomi Campbell (who didn't show up on the runway for his first women's fashion show) and questioned by the FBI (who did show up in his office right after September 11 because he fit the profile). He's soared and sunk more than a few times—and lived to tell the tales. Threads is his off-the-record take on fashion, from the inside out. With breezy irreverence, he looks at guys and taste, divas and deviousness, fabric and texture, and all those ties. He takes us to the luxe bastion of Louis Boston, where he came of age and learned the trade, and to the seductive domain of Polo Ralph Lauren, where he became associate director of menswear design. He reveals the mystique of department-store politics, what's what at the sample sale, and who copies whom. He explains the process of making great clothes, from conception and sketch to manufacturing and marketing. Whether he's traveling by daredevil horse, plunging plane, Paris Métro, or cross-country limo, Abboud is an illuminating guide to a complex world.	2005-08-18	HarperCollins						ZZZ000000
9780060558895	Crowded with Genius,The Scottish Enlightenment: Edinburgh's Moment of the Mind	James Buchan		In the early eighteenth century, Edinburgh was a filthy backwater town synonymous with poverty and disease. Yet by century's end, it had become the marvel of modern Europe, home to the finest minds of the day and their breathtaking innovations in architecture, politics, science, the arts, and economics—all of which continue to echo loudly today. Adam Smith penned The Wealth of Nations. James Boswell produced The Life of Samuel Johnson. Alongside them, pioneers such as David Hume, Robert Burns, James Hutton, and Sir Walter Scott transformed the way we understand our perceptions and feelings, sickness and health, relations between the sexes, the natural world, and the purpose of existence. In Crowded with Genius, James Buchan beautifully reconstructs the intimate geographic scale and boundless intellectual milieu of Enlightenment Edinburgh. With the scholarship of a historian and the elegance of a novelist, he tells the story of the triumph of this unlikely town and the men whose vision brought it into being.	2004-11-17	HarperCollins						ZZZ000000
9780060739300	Fight Back and Win,My Thirty-Year Fight Against Injustice--And How You Can Win Your Own Battles	Gloria Allred&Deborah Caulfield Rybak		Voted by her peers as one of the best lawyers in America, and described by Time magazine as "one of the nation's most effective advocates of family rights and feminist causes," Allred has devoted her career to fighting for civil rights and has won hundreds of millions of dollars for victims of abuse. She has taken on countless institutions to promote equality, including the Boy Scouts, the Friars Club, and the United States Senate. And as the attorney for numerous high-profile clients—including Nicole Brown Simpson's family, actress Hunter Tylo, and Amber Frey, Scott Peterson's girlfriend—Allred has helped victims assert and protect their rights.   Throughout her memoir, Allred offers colorful—sometimes shocking—examples of self-empowerment from her personal and professional life. Presenting nearly fifty of her most memorable cases, Allred takes us deep inside the justice system to show how it's possible to win even in the face of staggering odds. Her inspiring true stories serve to remind us that winning justice depends on the righ-teousness of the cause and an individual's willingness to stand up, speak out, and fight back. Fight Back and Win is a powerful testament to Gloria Allred's trailblazing career and the battles she has fought alongside countless brave individuals to win justice for us all.	2007-02-06	HarperCollins						ZZZ000000

But dealing with the lady boss of the rustlers may be more than he can handle without help. So Danny's going to fight female fire with female fire, joining forces with one Martha Jane Canary. But kicking in with this tough gun-toting señorita could be more trouble than Danny Fog bargained for ... once he learns first-hand why folks hereabouts call her "Calamity."	2005-06-16	HarperTorch						ZZZ000000

9780061711336	What Obama means,--for our culture, our politics, our future	Jabari Asim		"This is our moment. This is our time," Barack Obama declared in his victory speech on November 4, 2008. Such a moment is an opportunity to explore who we are, where we've been, and what the emergence of a leader like Obama can tell us about our culture, our politics, and our future. In What Obama Means, Jabari Asim, author of the acclaimed The N Word, provides the context needed to understand what the Obama presidency means to Americans of all backgrounds.   Asim moves easily from the contemporary to the historical, showing how performers and athletes, such as Michael Jackson and Michael Jordan, laid the groundwork for Obama as much as did leaders such as Frederick Douglass, W. E. B. DuBois, and Martin Luther King Jr. He examines the impact of Sidney Poitier (whose Guess Who's Coming to Dinner could have been the story of the president's parents) and how the actor's navigation of Hollywood was a forerunner for Obama's own path in wooing America's white voters. Asim places Obama within the history of the black rhetorical tradition, alongside such figures as James Baldwin, Fannie Lou Hamer, and Barbara Jordan. He also describes how the "Obama phenomenon" grew from the ground up, focusing on the people who caught on even before their leaders did. He demonstrates how Obama turned the old civil-rights model of African American leadership on its head, and shows that Obama's election is evidence of the progress that has been made in healing wounds and broadening America's concept of leadership and inspiration.	2009-01-20	William Morrow						ZZZ000000

9780307381682	Sex, Love, and Fashion,A Memoir of a Male Model	Bruce Hulse		You may think you’ve heard everything about the modeling industry from Tyra Banks, but Sex, Love, and Fashion is the real behind-the-scenes scoop, from a true insider who is considered one of the top ten male models of all time.In the glamorous galaxy of modeling, Bruce Hulse was a supernova. Taken under the wing of famed photographer Bruce Weber as a fledgling model, Hulse went on to collaborate with the industry’s biggest names as one of the world’s top male models. In the 1980s and 1990s, the exciting world of top models was filled with sex, drugs, and countless other indulgences. Bruce Hulse is one of the most recognizable figures of that time; from his iconic Calvin Klein and Levi's ads to his appearance on the cover of GQ, his face defined an era. In Sex, Love, and Fashion, Bruce shares the true stories of his globe-trotting career working with some of the industry’s biggest names–Calvin Klein, Janice Dickinson, Herb Ritts, Elle Macpherson, Andie MacDowell, Paulina Porizkova, and Cindy Crawford among them–and also details the exhilarating successes and painful failures he experienced on his way to the top.Bruce Hulse pulls back the curtain on the life of an international supermodel and reveals everything the cameras don’t expose. Sex, Love, and Fashion is a dishy, sexy, and honest look at what really happens to beautiful people playing in the often decadent fields of fashion glory.	2008-08-05	Crown Publishing Group						ZZZ000000
9780307395771	The First Billion Is the Hardest,Reflections on a Life of Comebacks and America's Energy Future	Thomas Boone Pickens		With a Plan for Reducing U.S. Oil DependencyIt’s never too late to top your personal best.Now eighty years old, T. Boone Pickens is a legendary figure in the business world. Known as the “Oracle of Oil” because of his uncanny ability to predict the direction of fuel prices, he built Mesa Petroleum, one of the largest independent oil companies in the United States, from a $2,500 investment. In the 1980s, Pickens became a household name when he executed a series of unsolicited buyout bids for undervalued oil companies, in the process reinventing the notion of shareholders’ rights. Even his failures were successful in that they forced risk-averse managers to reconsider the way they did business.When Pickens left Mesa at age sixty-eight after a spectacular downward spiral in the company’s profits, many counted him out. Indeed, what followed for him was a painful divorce, clinical depression, a temporary inability to predict the movement of energy prices, and the loss of 90 percent of his investing capital. But Pickens was far from out.From that personal and professional nadir, Pickens staged one of the most impressive comebacks in the industry, turning his investment fund’s remaining $3 million into $8 billion in profit in just a few years. That made him, at age seventy-seven, the world’s second-highest-paid hedge fund manager. But he wasn’t done yet. Today, Pickens is making some of the world’s most colossal energy bets. If he has his way, most of America’s cars will eventually run on natural gas, and vast swaths of the nation’s prairie land will become places where wind can be harnessed for power generation. Currently no less bold than he was decades ago when he single-handedly transformed America’s oil industry, Pickens is staking billions on the conviction that he knows what’s coming. In this book, he spells out that future in detail, not only presenting a comprehensive plan for American energy independence but also providing a fascinating glimpse into key resources such as water—yet another area where he is putting billions on the line.From a businessman who is extraordinarily humble yet is considered one of the world’s most visionary, The First Billion Is the Hardest is both a riveting account of a life spent pulling off improbable triumphs and a report back from the front of the global energy and natural-resource wars—of vital interest to anyone who has a stake in America’s future.	2008-09-02	Crown Publishers						ZZZ000000

9780340951583	In God We Doubt,Confessions of an Angry Agnostic	John Humphrys		Today’s agnostics are scorned by believers for their failure to find faith, as well as by atheists for being hopelessly wishy-washy and weak-minded. But John Humphrys is proud to count himself among the agnostic ranks. In this candid memoir he charts the history of his spiritual life, from his Christian childhood through the years in which he prayed every day of his life until his growing doubts finally began to overwhelm his faith. In 2006, he challenged the leaders of three of the world’s biggest religions to prove to him that God does exist, all to no avail. Enthusiastic and honest, this intriguing study shows that while doubt is not the easiest option, if is often the only possible one for the millions who can find no easy answers to the most profound questions.	2008-11-01	Hodder & Stoughton						ZZZ000000

9780375509124	Adventure capitalist,the ultimate investor's road trip	Jim Rogers		Drive . . . and grow rich!The bestselling author of Investment Biker is back from the ultimate road trip: a three-year drive around the world that would ultimately set the Guinness record for the longest continuous car journey. In Adventure Capitalist, legendary investor Jim Rogers, dubbed “the Indiana Jones of finance” by Time magazine, proves that the best way to profit from the global situation is to see the world mile by mile. “While I have never patronized a prostitute,” he writes, “I know that one can learn more about a country from speaking to the madam of a brothel or a black marketeer than from meeting a foreign minister.”Behind the wheel of a sunburst-yellow, custom-built convertible Mercedes, Rogers and his fiancée, Paige Parker, began their “Millennium Adventure” on January 1, 1999, from Iceland. They traveled through 116 countries, including many where most have rarely ventured, such as Saudi Arabia, Myanmar, Angola, Sudan, Congo, Colombia, and East Timor. They drove through war zones, deserts, jungles, epidemics, and blizzards. They had many narrow escapes.They camped with nomads and camels in the western Sahara. They ate silkworms, iguanas, snakes, termites, guinea pigs, porcupines, crocodiles, and grasshoppers.Best of all, they saw the real world from the ground up—the only vantage point from which it can be truly understood—economically, politically, and socially.Here are just a few of the author’s conclusions: • The new commodity bull market has started.• The twenty-first century will belong to China.• There is a dramatic shortage of women developing in Asia.• Pakistan is on the verge of disintegrating.• India, like many other large nations, will break into several countries.• The Euro is doomed to fail.• There are fortunes to be made in Angola.• Nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) are a scam.• Bolivia is a comer after decades of instability, thanks to gigantic amounts of natural gas.Adventure Capitalist is the most opinionated, sprawling, adventurous journey you’re likely to take within the pages of a book—the perfect read for armchair adventurers, global investors, car enthusiasts, and anyone interested in seeing the world and understanding it as it really is.	2003-05-13	Random House						ZZZ000000

THE WICKED WIT OF CHARLES DICKENS is a sampling of Dickens’ signature style, which combines biting wit and serious social commentary to great effect.Charles Dickens is widely considered one of the greatest English novelists and was an influential spokesman for the conscience of nineteenth-century England. Deeply affected by the mixed fortunes of his early years, Dickens endeavored to expose and protest against the evils of Victorian society, using his novels and later his renown to publicize issues concerning the poor and downtrodden. His writings are just as relevant today as they were when they were written.THE WICKED WIT OF CHARLES DICKENS begins with an introduction to Dickens’ life and works. The quotes within span such topics as Childhood and Adolescence; Dickens in Love; Prison, Politics, and the Law; Bumblings; Americans Can’t Bear to be Told Their Faults; and Papa, Potatoes, Poultry, Prunes, and Prisms: Nonsenses. At the end of the book is a list of Dickens’ works.Containing lengthy extracts from scenes of great amusement, as well as pithy, witty remarks uttered by his unique characters, this book is a must for all Dickens admirers, and also for readers looking for an introduction to his life and works.	2007-07-03	Random House Value Publishing						ZZZ000000

9780743206839	The 8th habit,from effectiveness to greatness	Stephen R. Covey		That the world has changed and is continuing to change at a rapid pace is not news. People are much more aware of everything around them. The consumer revolution has accelerated dramatically. But something vital is missing in all of this change. Leadership has not kept up with the changes going on in the world. From boardrooms to classrooms, leadership is being challenged on a daily basis yet now a new leadership model has been given. Dr Covey introduces the four roles of the new leader - modelling, pathfinding, aligning and empowering - and how those qualities can change you and your organisation. He discusses how trust can be lost throughout organisations and how it is imperative that any organisation bring trust back to the company if it is to survive. Covey also shows how to go from what he calls a 'want to' person to a 'can do' person and how doing so can completely transform people and organisations. Through his ideas, one will discover how to: Use the four vital roles to establish trust and make growth a given; build and sustain an atmosphere of respect and openness; keep and inspire your most talented workers; apply creative co-operation to reach new levels of performance; develop leadership at every level of your organisation; take advantage of strengths and compensate for weakness; reduce cynicism and improve morale.	2006	Simon & Schuster						ZZZ000000

9780765357724	Waking Brigid	Francis Clark		Waking Brigid is a darkly evocative novel set in haunting Savannah, Georgia. Though the city was physically spared during the Civil War, its citizens did not come through unscathed.  Into this dark and battered culture comes young Brigid Rourke, a beautiful Irish nun. Driven by the ravages of the famine, Brigid's family chose to give the girl up to the service of the Church to ensure her survival. But in order to do that she had to reject her people's pagan ways. The Church is all she has known and she seeks to do her duty…all the while fighting the lure of her people’s legacy.   Brigid's resolve is tested when a prominent Savannah citizen is cruelly murdered behind a locked and bolted door in an insane asylum. The last words of the man chilled the blood of all who heard him, and the fact that he was murdered while he was alone in the cell defies all logical reason. What follows is nothing less than an amazing clash between the forces of good and evil—dedicated white magicians versus the entrenched devil worshippers--for the soul of a city.	2009-03-03	Tom Doherty Associates						ZZZ000000
9780765358073	Space Vulture	Gary K. Wolf&John J. Myers		They grew up together in a tiny Illinois town and together discovered the special thrills, the magic and wonder, that only science fiction and fantasy can offer. Half a century later, Gary K. Wolf (creator of Roger Rabbit) and John J. Myers (Roman Catholic archbishop of Newark, New Jersey) are still the best of friends. They still love fantastic fiction and its ability to stretch the mind, enrich the spirit, and warm the heart.Determined to recapture the exhilarating science fiction of their youth, not just as it was, but as it should have been, they will transport us to the far reaches of the galaxy, where the mere mention of the interstellar pirate known as Space Vulture strikes fear into every heart and where a pioneering settler’s only hope on a hardscrabble colony world is that the dauntless lawman, Marshal Victor Corsaire, will rocket to the rescue.Come along for the ride and discover all the adventure, suspense, action, and fun that Gary and John first found in science fiction fifty years ago and share with you now in this rollicking tale of the spaceways.	2008-12-30	Tom Doherty Associates						ZZZ000000
9780767909990	What the Numbers Say,A Field Guide to Mastering Our Numerical World	Derrick Niederman&David Boyum		Our society is churning out more numbers than ever before, whether in the form of spreadsheets, brokerage statements, survey results, or just the numbers on the sports pages. Unfortunately, people’s ability to understand and analyze numbers isn’t keeping pace with today’s whizzing data streams. And the benefits of living in the Information Age are available only to those who can process the information in front of them.What the Numbers Say offers remedies to this national problem. Through a series of witty and engaging discussions, the authors introduce original quantitative concepts, skills, and habits that reduce even the most daunting numerical challenges to simple, bite-sized pieces. Why do the nutritional values on a Cheerios box appear different in Canada than in the U.S.? How is it that top-performing mutual funds often lose money for the majority of their shareholders? Why was the scoring system for Olympic figure skating doomed even without biased judges?By anchoring their discussions in real-world scenarios, Derrick Niederman and David Boyum show that skilled quantitative thinking involves old-fashioned logic, not advanced mathematical tools. Useful in an endless number of situations, What the Numbers Say is the practical guide to navigating today’s data-rich world.From the Hardcover edition.	2004-06-08	Broadway Books						ZZZ000000
9780809034079	Chasing Hubble's Shadows,The Search for Galaxies at the Edge of Time	Jeff Kanipe		"Chasing Hubble's Shadows "is an account of the continuing efforts of astronomers to probe the outermost limits of the observable universe. The book derives its title from something the great American astronomer Edwin Hubble once wrote: "Eventually, we reach the dim boundary--the utmost limits of our telescopes. There, we measure shadows, and we search among ghostly errors of measurement for landmarks that are scarcely more substantial." The quest for Hubble's "shadows"--those unimaginably distant, wispy traces of stars and galaxies that formed within the first few hundred million years after the Big Bang--takes us back, in effect, to the beginning of time as we are able to perceive it, when the first discrete stellar objects appeared out of what has lately come to be known as the "cosmic dark age." The information that is being gleaned from these dim sources--chiefly with the aid of Hubble's namesake, the Hubble Space Telescope--promises to yield clues to many cosmic puzzles, including the nature of the mysterious "dark energy" that is now believed to pervade all of space. Jeff Kanipe is an independent science journalist, specializing in astronomy, cosmology, and planetary science. He is the author of "A Skywatcher's Year." "Chasing Hubble's Shadow" is an account of the continuing efforts of astronomers to probe the outermost universe. The book derives its title from something the American astronomer Edwin Hubble once wrote: "Eventually, we reach the dim boundary--the utmost limits of our telescopes. There, we measure shadows, and we search among ghostly errors of measurement for landmarks that are scarcely more substantial." The quest for Hubble's "shadows"--those wispy, unimaginably distant traces of stars and galaxies that formed within the first few hundred million years after the big bang--takes us back, in effect, to the beginning of time as we are able to perceive it, when the first discrete stellar objects appeared out of what has lately come to be known as "the cosmic dark ages." The information that is being gleaned from these dim sources--chiefly with the aid of Hubble's namesake, the Hubble Space Telescope--promises to yield clues to many cosmic puzzles, including the nature of the mysterious "dark energy" that is now believed to pervade all of space. "Mr. Kanipe has provided a first-rate account of these mysteries and of how dauntless scientists go about trying to solve them."--Jeffery Marsh, "The ""Washington"" Times" "In "Chasing Hubble's Shadows," the scientific journalist Jeff Kanipe takes us to the frontiers of today's astronomy, where astronomers use an armory of sophisticated tools and techniques to peer at dimly visible galaxies astonishingly far away and far back in time. Their ability to do so has been magnified greatly since the launch (or, rather, the repair a few years later) of the Hubble Space Telescope . . . The two great scientific mysteries of the age are that most of the universe seems to consist of 'dark matter' and 'dark energy, ' the terms used to describe our ignorance of the nature of most of the energy that holds the universe together and the matter of which it is constructed, neither of which corresponds to the forms of energy and matter which we observe around us. Mr. Kanipe has provided a first-rate account of these mysteries and of how dauntless scientists go about trying to solve them."--Jeffery Marsh, "The ""Washington"" Times" "A fast-paced tour . . . [Kanipe's] enthusiasm is bound to excite and inspire."--"New Scientist" "Part history, part detective story, and even part travelogue . . . This book will be both instructive and enjoyable for anyone with an interest in the night skies."--"Science News" "A vivid description of how astronomers work and how ideas develop . . . Anyone curious about the mechanisms of our world will be thrilled by the book."--Patrick Petitjean, "Nature" "A broad overview of the current state of cosmology research, and a glimpse of some of the people and personalities involved in the field, all concisely summarized . . . The book is a great way to get up to speed on the current knowledge of, and challenges facing, astronomers in this field."--Jeff Foust, "The Space Review""A masterful synthesis of the work of many observational cosmologists, describing the searches for distant galaxies, explaining the possible limitations in the supernovae work, and integrating the optical studies with those of microwaves . . . [An] excellent book."--D. E. Hogg, Emeritus, National Radio Astronomy Observatory, "Choice" "Painting with a broad brush on a great canvas, Jeff Kanipe illustrates what we know and what we don't yet know about our cosmic origins. As you read "Chasing Hubble"'"s Shadows," you visit the great observatories where the chase is under way, meet the people who are doing the work, and learn how matter in our universe has been shaped by the forces of gravity and dark energy."--Robert P. Kirshner, author of "The Extravagant Universe: Exploding Stars, Dark Energy, and the Accelerating Cosmos" "If you want to know why the Hubble Telescope has gotten astronomers so excited and to learn how this mighty instrument helped astronomers to uncover the dark mysteries of matter and energy in the universe, take a trip back to the beginning of time with Jeff Kanipe's lively and informative book."--Donald Goldsmith, coauthor of "Origins: Fourteen Billion Years of Cosmic Evolution" "Kanipe interviews a number of observers and theorists, reports their opinions and experiences and gives a good look at both the culture and the key issues of modern astronomy . . . [G]reat stuff for astronomy buffs."--"Kirkus Reviews" "Current research on the earliest galaxies engages the interest of astronomy journalist Kanipe. Reporting that the science has been revolutionized by the image of the Hubble deep field, the first baby portrait ever made of the universe by the Hubble Space Telescope, Kanipe explains how astrophysicists are interpreting the ruddy 'blobjects' appearing in the picture. Their distance is a crucial question, and the basis for the answer (an astounding 12 to 13 billion light years) emerges in the author's explanation of cosmological measuring sticks such as supernovae. Of most interest to scientists, however, is the evolutionary connection between the protogalaxies and the beginning of the universe. Piecing together the first billion years of the cosmos is Kanipe's main focus. He starts with demarcations of the epoch, including a dark era in which thick gas blocked light; a 'reionization' era coinciding with the formation of the first stars; and then their conglomeration into galaxies. Due to Kanipe's clarity on technical points, general readers will be as excited by the discovery as cosmologists."--Gilbert Taylor," Booklist" "The Hubble Space Telescope has been a wonderful tool because its location above the Earth's atmosphere has made possible astronomical views inaccessible	2007-01-24	Farrar, Straus and Giroux						ZZZ000000
9780887307966	Reengineering management,the mandate for new leadership	James Champy		The co-author of the monumental bestseller Reengineering the Corporation continues the reengineering revolution with another national bestseller that has already sold more than 165,000 copies in hardcover   Reengineering Management is a brilliant, practical and much needed book on the most powerful management idea of the decade. Reengineering—changing the traditional and outdated organization, processes and culture of a company—is corporate America's greatest challenge today.   In Reengineering Management, Champy examines the far-reaching changes managers must make for themselves and their companies to succeed in an era of unprecedented competition. Through his extensive consulting and research work, he shows how reengineering succeeds only when managers reinvent their own jobs and managerial styles. Otherwise, the ultra-efficient and effective reengineered processes for acquiring and serving customers, filling orders, bringing new concepts to market and other key business activities eventually fall apart.   Champy illustrates this new management agenda through first-hand experiences of managers of reengineered operations at Federal Express, Wisconsin Electric, CIGNA Health Care, Hewlett-Packard, AT&T Universal Card Services and other companies. Champy shows how they are mastering the managerial challenges of reengineering, and as a result are making their organizations exciting and competitive. As more and more organizations reengineer, the experiences of these managers will become an insiders' guide to managerial life in the company of the future.   Reengineering Management picks up where Reengineering the Corporation left off—by exploring the managerial implications of the reengineered workplace. As reengineering becomes critical to all organizations, Reengineering Management will be the road map for managerial success in the future. It is, indeed, the manifesto for the next managerial revolution.	1996-01-04	HarperBusiness						ZZZ000000
9781400065516	The edge of disaster,rebuilding a resilient nation	Stephen E. Flynn&Council on Foreign Relations		Americans are in denial, maintains security expert Flynn, about how vulnerable our nation is to disaster, be it terrorist attack or act of God. But what's truly shocking, he argues, is how little we have learned from September 11 and Hurricane Katrina. America is living on borrowed time--and squandering it. Flynn describes how we have become increasingly vulnerable to disaster by grossly neglecting the complex, crumbling infrastructure that provides our water, food, health care, electricity, and transportation. Through a series of realistic scenarios, he dramatizes the prime areas of documented risk, where terrrorist attacks could kill thousands and bring regions to their economic knees--but the wrath of Mother Nature may be our gravest threat. But Flynn also explores what we can do about it, as individuals and as a society, outlining a detailed, pragmatic preparedness program we can embrace right now.--From publisher description.	2007-02-20	Random House						ZZZ000000
9781400066162	A bull in China,investing profitably in the world's greatest market	Jim Rogers		If the twentieth century was the American century, then the twenty-first century belongs to China. Now the one and only Jim Rogers shows how any investor can get in on the ground floor of “the greatest economic boom since England’s Industrial Revolution.”In this indispensable new book, one of the world’s most successful investors, Jim Rogers, brings his unerring investment acumen to bear on this huge and unruly land now being opened to the world and exploding in potential.Rogers didn’t just wake up a Sinophile yesterday. He’s been tracking the Chinese economy since he first went to China in 1984 in preparation for his round-the-world motorcycle trip and then again, later, when he saw Shanghai’s newly reopened stock exchange (which looked like an OTB office). In the decades that followed–especially in recent years, with the easing of Communist party financial dictates–the facts speak for themselves:• The Chinese economy’s growth rate has averaged 9 percent since the start of the 1980s.• China’s savings rate is over 35 percent (in America, it’s 2 percent).• 40 percent of China’s output goes to exports (so there’s no crippling foreign debt).• $60 billion a year in direct foreign investment, combined with a trade surplus, has brought Beijing’s foreign currency reserves to over $1 trillion.• China’s fixed assets–ports, bridges, and roads–double every two and a half years. In short, if projections hold, China will surpass the United States as the world’s largest economy in as little as twenty years. But the time to act is now. In A Bull in China, you’ll learn what industries offer the newest and best opportunities, from power, energy, and agriculture to tourism, water, and infrastructure. In his trademark down-to-earth style, Rogers demystifies the state policies that are driving earnings and innovation, takes the intimidation factor out of the A-shares, B-shares, and ADRs of Chinese offerings, and encourages any reader to trust his or her own expertise (if you’re a car mechanic, check out their auto industry). A Bull in China also features fascinating profiles of “Red Chip” companies, such as Yantu Changyu, China’s largest winemaker, which sells a “Healthy Liquor” line mixed with herbal medicines. Plus, if you want to export something to China yourself–or even buy land there–Rogers tells you the steps you need to take.No other book–and no other author–can better help you benefit from the new Chinese revolution. Jim Rogers shows you how to make the “amazing energy, potential, and entrepreneurial spirit of a billion people” work for you.	2007-12-04	Random House						ZZZ000000

You’ll learn how to apply the specifics of good compatibility to a prospective date or mate, as well as how to break things off when you find yourself in the wrong relationship.But since great relationships aren’t built on compatibility alone, marriage experts Michael and Amy Smalley also delve into the “forever factor,” giving you the skills you need to turn your romance into a lifelong love affair. You’ll learn how to deal with conflict, how to develop a healthy sex life, and how to recover when you inevitably hurt one another.Fantastic marriages begin long before the exchange of the rings; they start when two people in search of love commit themselves to learning to how to love well…and forever. Because finding and keeping the love of your life is about much More Than a Match.	2007-01-16	WaterBrook Press						ZZZ000000

Strong, fast, agile, and focused -- when T.O. takes the field, he's in complete control.

Whether you want to slim down or bulk up, develop explosive speed or increase your endurance, define your abs or fine-tune your form, T.O.'s Finding Fitness will unlock your potential with a diet and exercise plan tailored to your fitness goals.Inside T.O.'s Finding Fitness, Owens shares complete workout routines for beginner, intermediate, and advanced levels, all of which can be done using his T.O. Super Strong Man Bands, free weights, or his own strength-training stretches. Photographs, easy-to-follow instructions, and helpful tips from Buddy Primm (T.O.'s personal trainer) guarantee results. Along with plans for general fitness and weight loss, there are separate guides designed to enhance your performance in football, baseball, golf, martial arts, tennis, and basketball. And whether you're looking for the winning catch, the lightning-fast serve, or the money shot at the buzzer, or you just want to keep up with the kids and power through an afternoon at the office, you need the right fuel to stay at the top of your game. T.O. helps you make the right eating decisions with meal plans detailing his choices both in and out of season.Finally, as any athlete learns, just knowing what to do isn't always enough. T.O. realizes how hard it can be to stick to a routine, so over the years he has figured out how to motivate himself and make every day count. His approach has given him the crucial mental edge on his competitors and kept him fired up through setbacks and injuries. Get inspired today: take control, make the mind-body-spirit connection, and find your own best body.	2008-09-23	Simon & Schuster						ZZZ000000

9781582295725	Pinocchio Parenting,21 Outrageous Lies We Tell Our Kids	Chuck Borsellino		Are you a Pinocchio Parent? You may be asking yourself these very questions: What lies, clichés, and half-truths do I tell my children? How do these lies hurt my children and my relationship with them? Clinical psychologist and author Chuck Borsellino claims that our culture condones all sorts of lies -- from "tiny fibs" to calloused misrepresentations. Though well-intentioned in our unintentional lies, we set our children up for failure and disappointment and undercut our credibility.In the pages of this book, Dr. Chuck Borsellino helps you sort out fact from fiction, intention from outcome. Most important, you'll learn a better way -- a way to help your children live life within the bounds of reality while fully exploring the dreams of their heart.	2006-08-08	Simon and Schuster						ZZZ000000

9781847390776	Planet India,the turbulent rise of the world's largest democracy	Mira Kamdar		India is everywhere - Indian studios produce animated features and special effects for Hollywood movies; Indian software manages our health records; and Indian customer service centres answer our calls. A country of English speakers and a free-market democracy, with the youngest population on Earth, India is not only the fastest growing market for the next new thing, but a source for the technological innovation that will drive the global economy. Yet, India is also in a race against time to bring the benefits of the twenty-first century to the 800 million Indians who live on less than £1 per day, and it must do so in a way that is environmentally sustainable and politically viable on a scale never before achieved. If India succeeds, it will not only save itself, it may save us all. If it fails, we will all suffer. As goes India, so goes the world. Like CHINA, INC, published in 2006 by S&S, PLANET INDIA will capture and catalyze the growing interest in this rising power. With in-depth research, interviews and provocative analysis, Mira Kamdar offers a penetrating view of India and its cultural and economic impact on the world. From Bollywood to the Indian diaspora to India's effect on global politics she reports on the people, companies and places shaping the new India. Kamdar examines the challenges India faces while celebrating India's tremendous vitality and the opportunities this Asian democracy has to shape its own and all of our destinies.	2008-05-06	Pocket Books						ZZZ000000
9781847393951	Divas	Rebecca Chance		Stunning good looks, a gorgeous fiance, a bottomless trust fund, London's leading It Girl, Lola Fitzsimmons, leads a charmed life, a pampered princess whose rich father funds her every whim. Evie on the other hand has had to work her own way up life's greasy pole - literally! But, having hooked herself an indulgent sugar daddy, Evie has been able to give up her pole-dancing career, abandoning New York's seedy strip bars for a luxury Manhattan penthouse. Both Lola and Evie are about to meet their nemesis. Overnight, Lola's credit cards are refused, her fiance disappears and she finds herself locked out of her own Chelsea mews house. That same day, Evie is abruptly thrown out onto the streets. One woman lies behind their misfortune. With Lola's father lying helpless in a coma, her icy stepmother has seized control of the purse strings - and cut off her spoiled stepdaughter without a penny. The same stepmother who happens to be married to Evie's sugar daddy. Although the two girls loathe one another on sight, Lola and Evie must team up if they are to defeat their common enemy: the Ice Queen herself. Let battle commence.	2009-08-03	Simon + Schuster UK						ZZZ000000

9783822851432	Small City Houses	Simone Schleifer		Les solutions innovantes pour pallier l'espace limité reflètent un style de vie contemporain empreint de créativité et d'originalité. En effet, une petite maison dispose aujourd'hui de toute une gamme de possibilités pour offrir un vrai confort de vie. A titre d'exemple, dans certaines habitations ou réhabilitations récentes, les pièces qui ne sont pas indispensables, à l'instar de halls d'entrée et de couloirs, sont supprimées pour gagner de la surface et amplifier l'espace de vie principal. Cet ouvrage offre une sélection de projets originaux et imaginatifs, représentatifs de l'espace de vie urbain quotidien. Outre la variété de styles et les différents types de maison, tous ont le même dénominateur commun : la réduction d'une maison au strict minimum nécessaire due à la limitation des mètres carrés. Des projets uniques, œuvres de designers de réputation internationale, ont été sélectionnés pour refléter les nouvelles formes d'habitat et de concepts sur les plans de distribution, matériaux, textures et lumière. Ces projets sont des exemples de micro urbanisme intérieur, de l'art du design à façonner l'espace pour créer un univers personnel, fonctionnel et esthétique.	2006	Evergreen						ZZZ000000

9788190732604	The Prince And The Pauper	Mark Twain		A chance meeting between a member of the royal family and a street urchin triggers a course of events that form the basis of this enthralling story.Tom, the pauper; and Edward, the prince, discover that not only do they share the same birthday, but they also look identical. Being the boys that they are, they decide to have some fun and exchange clothes. However, little do they know that this will land them up in the most bizarre of situations.Inadvertently, the boys end up swapping places with each other - Tom becomes the prince and Edward, the pauper. No one believes them when they try to explain their true identities, so they are forced to adapt to their new lifestyles, with most interesting of consequences.This well-loved novel by Mark Twain takes a humorous look at the sixteenth-century society and the inequalities that existed at that time, and perhaps still do today.	2009	Campfire						ZZZ000000
