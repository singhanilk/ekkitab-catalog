9780195696547	Seduced by the familiar,narration and meaning in Indian popular cinema	M. K. Raghavendra		The Hindi film industry has come to represent 'India' in the world today. Drawing from this 'globalization' of 'Bollywood', Seduced by the Familiar is a contemporary take on Indian cinema as represented by Hindi films. The author, M.K. Raghavendra, an award-winning film critic and scholar,makes a case for the 'surface' reading of Hindi films, in contrast to the rather disparaging view that critics, and sometimes practitioners, have traditionally taken of 'popular' cinema. The book traces the main themes of Hindi cinema chronologically from before 1947 up to contemporary times. Beginning with 'primitive cinema' such as Raja Harishchandra (1913), Raghavendra traces the trajectory of Hindi cinema from Baazi (1951) to Mother India (1957), Yaadon ki Baarat (1973), Sholay(1975), Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak (1988), and Hum Aapke Hain Koun! (1994), right on till the recent Kabhi Alvida na Kehna (2006). He studies the thematic continuities, myths, archetypes, and formal structures of this body of cinema and analyses the legitimacy and enduring popularity of Hindi cinemavis-a-vis the history of the Indian nation. In addition, Seducing the Familiar includes an Introduction specifying the book's theoretical underpinnings, and a detailed chapter on narrative forms and conventions in Hindi cinema such as melodrama. Providing a lucid and sympathetic view of Hindi 'popular' cinema, Seducing the Familiar is anaccessible study that will interest students and researchers of cultural and film studies, sociology, and history, as well as general readers interested in the phenomenon of 'Bollywood'.	2008-09-01	Oxford University Press						ZZZ000000

In fact, a person's motivation behind choice is treated here as a parametric variable which may or may not coincide with the pursuit of self-interest. Given the large number of practical problems arising from the rolesand limitations of different concepts of interest and the judgement of advantage and well-being, this scholarly investigation is both of theoretical interest and practical import.	1999	Oxford University Press						ZZZ000000

9780195692532	India Infrastructure Report 2008,Business Models of the Future	3i Network		Till recently India had been creating infrastructural facilities mainly by employing public resources. Now over the next five years an accelerated pace of economic growth is envisaged which can materialize only when India builds infrastructure at a faster rate. Public investments alone cannotmeet the growing infrastructure demands. The government has been making efforts to attract private capital into infrastructure. An important step in these initiatives is public-private-partnership, a long term contractual partnership between private and public sector agencies specifically financing, designing, implementing, and operatinginfrastructure facilities. These partnerships help obtain the twin objectives of high growth and equity on a sustainable basis. This seventh IIR thus focuses on PPP growth models of the future in power, telecom, transport, commercial and urban infrastructure, and social infrastructure. The modelshighlight global best practices in PPP in these sectors with successful case studies from India and abroad.The India Infrastructure Report 2008 discusses: * Competitive bidding models for infrastructure projects and critical factors required for a minimum subsidy model to succeed. * Models on auction bidding for rural infrastructure, e-governance, and multi-channel delivery mechanism. * Tolling and payment mechanism models for roads, railways, and airports. * Models for public service financing and affordable housing. * Compensation models for land acquisition and inclusive development of SEZs. * Models for solid waste management, rural water supply, and sanitation. * PPP models for health care, primary education, vocational education, and eco-tourism. The IIR is an invaluable resource for policymakers, academics, business persons, and finance professionals. It is a collaborative effort of academics, professionals providing infrastructure services, and policymakers under the aegis of 3iNetwork. The network is managed by Infrastructure DevelopmentFinance Company (IDFC), Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad, and Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur.	2008-05-01	Oxford University Press						ZZZ000000
9780195696929	India - social development report 2008,development and displacement	Hari Mohan Mathur		There are groups who oppose development projects that displace people from their lands and livelihoods and demand that such projects should not be undertaken. While this demand is unrealistic, the concern to save people is legitimate. The real issue then is to undertake development in a waythat ensures minimum disruption and helps those relocated to share its benefits. This report, thus, shows the way forward and emphasizes the need to adopt credible policies that minimize displacement, properly compensate those relocated to make development possible, and give them a permanent stakein project benefits. Besides these, it takes stock of issues like poverty, unemployment, health, local government and decentralization, child labour, and how women fare across social indices. Complete with a social development index which ranks Indian states, this report will be a useful primarysource and research tool.	2008-11	Oxford University Press						ZZZ000000

9780195690484	Appropriation and invention of tradition,the East India Company and Hindu law in early colonial Bengal	Nandini Bhattacharyya-Panda		The beginning of Anglo-Hindu jurisprudence was occasioned by decisive developments in the cultural, intellectual, and legal history of India. This book deals with the appropriation of the Dharmasastras - a powerful written tradition - and its codification, in the construction of Hindu law. Itexplores the significant connections between this process of formalization and the consolidation of the empire in Bengal. Bhattacharyya-Panda analyses the shifting administrative and political needs of the colonial regime as well as the perceptions and attitudes of the officials in this process of codification. Through a careful study of the compilations, Vivadarmavasetu and Vivadabhabgarnava alongside their lateeighteenth-century colonial translations, she brings out the ways in which ancient textual traditions - the prescriptive, normative, and moralistic rules of the Dharmasastras - were metamorphosed into legal rules to be directly administered in courts.

9780195668322	History and beyond	Romila Thapar		These four books are on seemingly discrete and different aspects of early Indian history, yet they are interconnected. Historiography links many facets, concerned as it is with interpretations of the past. In recent years historical interpretation has drawn on other disciplines and this is evident in Interpreting Early India. The subject is history, but the discussions in this work move beyond history to provide a glimpse of explorations of new historical territories relating to early India. Time, it is argued in Time as a Metaphor of History, is an essential component of a historical perspective. Societies have varying forms of time, depending on function and perceptions. Conventional attempts to assign these particular forms of time- either cyclical or linear- have now been questioned. The most meaningful understanding of time and history is to view time at the intersection of the cyclic and the linear within the same society. Cultural Transaction suggests alternative ways of assessing the early Indian tradition. Using more recent concepts of culutre and tradition, it distances itself from the static notion of fixed traditions and exclusive high cultures. From Lineage to State discusses the history of north India from about 1000 to 400BC. Moving away from the conventional treatment of this period, it attempts to locate the processes of state formation and social configuration. The evidence, both literary and archeological, is linked, using a comparative framework, with studies of similar societies from other sources in order to suggest a mutlifaceted reconstruction of this history.	2004	Oxford University Press						ZZZ000000

9780195687859	India's Ancient Past	R. S. Sharma		R.S. Sharma, one of the best-known historians of early India, provides a comprehensive yet accessible text on the ancient period of Indian history. Beginning with topics such as historiography and the importance of Ancient Indian history, he goes on to cover the geographical, econological and linguistic settings, before looking at specific cultures of neolithic, chalcolithic types, the Harappan civilization, the Vedic period, the rise of Jainism and Buddhism, Magadha and the beginning of territorial states, the age of the Mauryas, Satavahanas, Guptas, and Harshavardhana. While taking the reader on this journey through time, he highlights important phenomena such as the beginning of urbanization and monarchy in India, invasions, the Varna system, commerce and trade, developments in philosophy and cultural efflorescence. He ends this insightful volume with a comments on the transition from the Ancient to the Medieval.  This book also addresses a number of issues which have become current in discussion on Ancient Inida today, such as the Identity of the Aryan Culture, and Historical Construction. This is a volume meant for all those who want a masterly, lucid, yet eminently readable introduction to and overview on India's early history by one of the master-scholars of Indian history - be it students, tourists, or the interested lay reader	2008-01-01	Oxford University Press						ZZZ000000
9780195633429	Interpreting early India	Romila Thapar		The essays in this volume are centrally about the ways in which early Indian history has been interpreted. More generally, they focus on issues in social history. Professor Thapar argues the importance of understanding and positioning various well-established perspectives on the Indian past in order to arrive at an informed understanding of contemporary situations - such as disputes between Hindus and other Indian communities. It is vitally important for historians and informed lay readers to consider the wide range of opinions and views that are available on our past, particularly on religion and society in ancient India. Interpretations rise out of ideological conceptions. Professor Thapar shows that the most influential ideologies which shaped the writing of early India initially had their moorings in European concerns; later, the rise of Indian nationalism questioned many of these conceptions; and most recently, these nationalist interpretations have also been questioned. This volume has essays on Durkheim and Weber's views on Indian caste and society; on D.D. Kosambi's contribution to Indian historiography; and on the recent attempts to project a composite Hinduism in early India by ignoring evidence on the existence of multiple communities and diverse identities. Romila Thapar was Professor of Ancient Indian History at Jawaharlal Nehru University.	1993	Oxford University Press						ZZZ000000

Focussing on Deoband, the most important Islamic seminary of the period, she discusses the ways in which the ulama enhanced a sense of cultural continuity in a period of alien rule. Deprived of a Muslim state, the leaders of Deoband sought to renew Islamic spiritual life by teaching early Islamic principles. To this end, they concerned themselves with popular behaviour and the education of both elite and non-elite Muslims through the spoken language, Urdu.	2005-07	Oxford University Press						ZZZ000000

9780195643626	Lord Curzon,The Last of the British Moghuls	Nayana Goradia		Dazzling, dedicated, some would say cast in an heroic mold, Lord Curzon of Kedleston, Viceroy of India was the last of the great British Moghuls. But it was also Curzon who was responsible for the partitioning of Bengal, an act which was to fuel widespread resentment and to foreshadow the Raj's demise. At thirty-nine, Curzon was the youngest Viceroy to be sent out to India. Yet, six years later, he was to return home a broken man, his viceroyalty in shambles, only to be dispossessed of the Prime Ministership he thought rightfully his. Goradia is the first of Curzon's biographers to examine the effects of Curzon being continually feted throughout his childhood, first by an adoring mother, and later by his male teachers and fellow pupils and students. Though he rose to every challenge, what bordered on narcissism was tragically to pursue him throughout adulthood, even in his first marriage to Mary, the first American-born vicerine, and most particularly in the struggle for power with Lord Kitcherner, in his eight-year affair with Elinor Glyn, and in his hopes of becoming Prime Minister. Goradia shows that there is also evidence of sado-masochistic tendencies. This is the first biography of Curzon to show how the unresolved problems of childhood were to pursue throughout his time as Viceroy of India.	1998	Oxford University Press						ZZZ000000
9780195633757	Lucknow: the last phase of an oriental culture	Abdul Halim Sharar&E. S. Harcourt&Fakhir Hussain		Sharar begins with a history of the Avadh dynasty, and the relations of its rulers - who ranged between extremes of political wisdom and dissolute instability - with the Mughal Emperors in Delhi and with the British at a time of rising British power in India. He also describes the development of Lucknow people's culture and social institutions to a degree of richness that may be compared with the levels attained by the most admired of the great civilizations of history. There follows a virtual 'anatomy' of the everyday life and artistic achievements of Lucknow during the period, covering an astonishing variety of topics: religion, education, medicine, ceremony and etiquette, dress, the culinary arts, calligraphy, dance popular speech and the practice of story-telling; such pastimes as kite- and pigeon-flying and the arts of combat and self-defence; the evolution of the Urdu language and its prose and poetry; architecture, music, pottery, theatre and other forms of entertainment. The culture of which Sharar writes was still alive in his day; it died out completely only in 1947, with the ultimate collapse of the feudal system. The editors provide extensive annotation that includes much background information for the benefit of both Western and Eastern readers, and takes account of scholarship on a number of subjects over the half-century that has elapsed since the original work was written. Among the attractive and varied illustrations are some particularly valuable early photographs of Lucknow buildings, a number of which were completely destroyed during the Mutiny.	1994	Oxford University Press						ZZZ000000

9780195669756	Religious pluralism in South Asia and Europe	Jamal Malik&Helmut Reifeld		This edited collection of 12 essays promotes comparative discussion on religious plural traditions in Europe and South Asia. The intention is to explore religious history and the dynamic process through which people engage with one another in and through their deepest differences, as a history of plural systems of religions in Europe and South Asia. It argues that while the significance of Christianity for Europe and Hinduism for South Asia cannot be ignored, this should notlead to overlook the importance of other religious traditions. Consequently, the complex network of different religious attitudes cannot be characterized by singular closed systems like Huntington's reductionist clash of civilizations suggests. Rather it requires a different view point: replacing thedominant monocausal and mono-linear concept of religious history through a "polyfocal" analysis of an open, pluralist field.	2005	Oxford University Press						ZZZ000000
9780195663990	Sovereign spheres,princes, education and empire in colonial India	Manu Bhagavan		Princely states were semi-autonomous territories that made up roughly 40 per cent of South Asia under British rule. This engaging study looks at educational reform in the context of debates on modernity and anti-colonial nationalism in the two leading progressive princely states in twentieth-century India, Baroda and Mysore. Sovereign Spheres explores the ways in which colonial authority was challenged and negotiated through both direct political action and more subtle, long-term initiatives involving social and cultural reform. In the process, the book furthers our understanding of domination and resistance and forces us to rethink our notions of the heretofore largely ignored princely states. These regions were central not only to the ideology of empire, but to nationalist visions of postcoloniality as well. In examining the role of princely state universities in the production of modern, governable subjects, the author interrogates the nature of public and private domains in the subcontinent and argues for a fundamental remodelling of colonial India.  Ground-breaking and authoritative, this book will be of importance not just to researchers of South Asian history, but to scholars and students of power dynamics, social reform movements, state formation, and to all those interested in comparative understandings of imperialism, nationalism, and modernity.	2003	Oxford University Press						ZZZ000000

While it is often taken for granted that the concept is Western, the book points out that questions of the wisdom of drafting a statement of rights for the entire world based on westernvalues were raised even at the time of the framing of the Universal Declaration of Human rights in 1948 and examines the criticisms of that document that have surfaced in the ensuing years from Asia and Africa that it is not of relevance to their societies. Overall, the book examines questionsraised from a range of perspectives, including historical, secular, economic, philosophical, and religious.	2006-01-01	Oxford University Press						ZZZ000000
9780198062509	India in the Shadows of Empire,A Legal and Political History (1774-1950)	Mithi Mukherjee		This pioneering research offers a sweeping new interpretation of the complex and seemingly contradictory nature of Indian democracy and polity. In contrast to much of existing scholarship, it joins the colonial and postcolonial periods in Indian history into a seamless narrative. This book explains the postcolonial Indian polity by presenting an alternative historical narrative of the British Empire in India and Indias struggle for independence. It pursues this narrative along two major trajectories.  On the one hand, it focuses on the role of imperial judicial institutions and practices in the making of both the British Empire and the anti-colonial movement under the Congress, with the lawyer as political leader. On the other hand, it offers a novel interpretation of Gandhis non-violent resistance movement as being different from the Congress. It shows that the Gandhian movement, as the most powerful force largely responsible for Indias independence, was anchored not in western discourses of political and legislative freedom but rather in Indic traditions of renunciative freedom, with the renouncer as leader.  This volume offers a comprehensive and new reinterpretation of the Indian Constitution in the light of this historical narrative. The book contends that the British colonial idea of justice and the Gandhian ethos of resistance have been the two competing and conflicting driving forces that have determined the nature and evolution of the Indian polity after independence.	2010	Oxford University Press						ZZZ000000

9780195698534	Challenges to democracy in India	Rajesh M. Basrur&Nehru Centre		This book is a selection of lectures organized by the Nehru Centre, Mumbai. The speakers are among the most respected public personalities in India. It addresses crucial questions about the functioning of Indian democracy and the seemingly intractable problems facing it. Critical issues examined in the lectures include the persistence of elitism in contrast to the ideals of constitutional democracy, the severe decline of probity in public life, the gulf between the rulers and the ruled, the paradox between public faith in the political process of democracy and the failure of institutions, the dangers of judicial governance, the relationship between democracy and education, and the adverse consequences of unbridled economic liberalization and globalization. The contributors identify linkages between issues that have traditionally not been recognized as connected, for example the development process and the rights of indigenous peoples, caste oppression, patriarchy and gender discrimination, the centralized structure of political parties and mounting corruption, and underdevelopment, inequality, and comprehensive security.Rajesh M.

9780195693799	Democracy and Constitutionalism in India	Sudhir Krishnaswamy		This book presents a completely reconfigured understanding of the judicial role in Indian constitutional law. The author contends that basic structure review must be recognized as a novel, independent, and distinct form of constitutional review that possesses a sound basis in the constitutionitself, and operates independently of other forms of constitutional judicial review.The author shows how basic structure review is different from rights-based judicial review under articles 13, 32, and 226, federal-state competence-based review under articles 245 and 247, and common law administrative law review which has been assimilated into articles 14 and 21-rights t toequality and life and liberty respectively. The author examines whether basic structure review is an appropriate exercise of judicial power or an abuse of it. He goes on to reformulate the contours of constitutional judicial review provided for in the Indian Constitution and works out the justification for this exercise of judicial power andso a new conception of the judicial role. He tries to develop an essential benchmark against which judicial performance may be assessed and the confusions currently inherent in the Indian debate on judicial activism finally eliminated.	2009-01-01	Oxford University Press						LAW000000

9780198061762	Human Rights in a Post Human World,Critical Essays	Upendra Baxi		This work is described by its distinguished author as a sequel to The Future of Human Rights. It is an analysis of the state of human rights in a 'post human' and 'machinistic' world almost overwhelmed by security concerns, 'terrorist threats', and technoscience. It begins with a series ofquestions: Are there now two different realms of human rights: human rights in times of peace and human rights in the 'state of exception'? Does such a distinction affect the nascent jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court? In what way do these impact on global social policy concerningdevelopment? The book goes on to present a critique of approaches towards a theory of human rights proposed by Amartya Sen and Sen's emphasis on the ethical, as opposed to juridical, nature of such rights. Focusing on the human right to development, the author examines why the UN Declaration on theHuman Right to Development has not attracted more attention and goes on to highlight the work of Arjun Sengupta and its implications for the human right to development. It goes on to examine how in the current world scenario the 'emancipatory potential' of human rights may be carried forward intheoretical work and through activism.	2009-04-01	Oxford University Press						LAW000000

9780195693201	Scaling justice,India's Supreme Court, anti-terror laws, and social rights	Shylashri Shankar		This book seeks to answer the question 'What influences the choices and decisions that Indian Supreme Court judges make?'. In different contexts and cases contradictory images remain in circulation; judges are variously described as passive, pro-active, impartial, biased, pro-citizen,pro-business, apolitical, pro-poor etc. After briefly explaining the views in different schools of thought, the author sets out her 'embedded negotiator' approach, which addresses the diverse influences on judicial decision- makers. In this approach the focus is trained on judges and their constantnegotiations within grey zones in the fields of civil liberties and social rights. To establish the validity of the approach the author uses the Probit model, which she also explains extensively. She studies a sample of civil liberties cases spanning the period 1950 to 2005 and social rights casespost Emergency. She collates the data base of cases with another data base containing characteristics of 116 Supreme Court judges, including religious affiliation. This is the first time that such a model has been used in Indian legal research.	2009-01-01	Oxford University Press						ZZZ000000

9780198060000	The International Law of the Sea,India and UNCLOS 1982	O. P. Sharma		The law of the sea has undergone more change in the last fifty years than it has in the previous four hundred. All naval operations, both in times of peace as well as of war, are supposed to be carried out within the framework of international law, which now centres around the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, 1982. An understanding of today's law of the sea is critical for domestic as well as international maritime trade and inevitably of course, for national security. This comprehensive book provides clarity on what the legitimate use of ocean space is and what is not. It examines the new jurisdictional boundaries or functional divisions of the oceans into several maritime zones along with their military implications. One of the key aims of the author is to create a ready reference for naval officers who are required under the naval regulations to 'observe the principles of International law', but whose training does not prepare them for dealing with them especially in view of the impact of advanced technology on traditional rules of law. Where relevant judgments of the International Court of Justice, the Law of the Sea Tribunal, and national/municipal courts are referred to and explained.	2009	Oxford University Press						ZZZ000000

Dealing with one of the most crucial periods in Indian history, namelyBritish colonialism, Sukhapathya Bharater Itihas (1976) is significant in forging a unique relationship between form and content. To match the content, Sircar uses the form of classroom teaching. With Teachers instructing Students, he covers more than three hundred years of British rule withoutdeveloping a 'story'.Bagalacharitmanas revolves around Bagala, who having lost his parents in childhood, is brought up and educated at his uncle's house where he suffers constant humiliation. The play is about how, through supernatural intervention, Bagala finds himself and ultimately stands up against injustice. Oncehe has gained courage, Bagala decides to throw away magic and act all by himself. The play reminds people that no change can be brought about by magic; it is only through human will and action that something worthwhile can be achieved. Along with a comprehensive Introduction, this volume includes aninterview with Badal Sircar, production history of his plays, and a special photo section.	2010-06-01	Oxford University Press						ZZZ000000

9780195640687	The collected poems of A.K. Ramanujan	A. K. Ramanujan		A.K. Ramanujan (1929-1993) was, arguably, modern Indias finest English-language poet. At the time of his death he was Professor of Linguistics at the University of Chicago, and recognized as the worlds most profound scholar of South Indian language and culture. During his lifetime he published three volumes of verse in English -- The Striders (1966), Relations (1971), and Second Sight (1986) -- and had completed work on a fourth volume, The Black Hen, which is published here for the first time.Ramanujan is best known for his pioneering translations of ancient Tamil poetry into modern English. These translations permanently altered the perceptions of the Indian literary map in the West. Before him, ancient Indian literature was thought to be mainly Sanskritic. After he published The Interior Landscape: Poems of Love and War, and other volumes between the sixties and eighties it became apparent to modern poets and scholars that there was a wealth of poetry in other Indic traditions.Reflecting his lifelong interests in folklore, anthropology, structuralism, and biculturalism, this volume of his collected poems represents the complex distillation of a lifetime of unusual thought and feeling. It will be welcomed by all lovers of contemporary poetry.	1997	Oxford University Press						ZZZ000000

9780195696592	Epic nation,reimagining the Mahabharata in the age of the empire	Pamela Lothspeich		Epic Nation explores in detail the appropriations and reimaginings of the Mahabharata as a text in the Pauranik genre which served several purposes in the late colonial period-they provided alternatives to colonial constructions of Indian history, they served as forms of protest and resistanceto colonial rule, and they provided an ideological support for the nationalist movement. Pamela Lothspeich discusses the ambiguous relationship between myth and history, the debates and controversies regarding the Hindi movement, as well as the complex issue of communalism in the construction of anidealized Hindu past. A wide range of writings have been covered-from the elite, 'canonical' writers such as Mahavirprasad Dvivedi, Maithilisharan Gupt, and Ramcharit Upadhyay, to the relatively underestimated playwright Badrinarayan Bhatt and the Parsi commercial theatre of Kathavacak. The Epiloguetraces the trends in Pauranik literature, in the post-1940 era, in relatively newer forms such as the short story and the novel, and also film and TV. With a glossary of literary terms, an appendix citing Hindi literature based on the Mahabharata (1866-2008), and detailed bibliography, Epic Nationwould be of interest to students and researchers of literature, history, and cultural studies, as well as general readers.	2009-02-01	Oxford University Press						ZZZ000000

The ghazals (poems consisting of at least five unrelatedcouplets) show a time when old values were breaking down with no new ones totake their place.Aijaz Ahmad began by selecting thirty-seven of the ghazals for literaltranslation. These versions were then given to the American poets who madepoetic interpretations of those ghazals which interested them. The resultingvariety of interpretation is remarkable, and indicates the evocativeness ofGhalib's poetry.The complete volume, which offers a fascinating insight into poetic creation aswell as the work of this unfamiliar poet, consists of Aijaz Ahmad's introductionto Ghalib poetry, the ghazals in Urdu, the literal versions, with explanatorynotes and the poems written by the American poets in response to theghazals.	1995	Oxford University Press						ZZZ000000

9780195696585	Sevasadan	Munshi Premchand&Snehal Shingavi&Vasudha Dalmia		Premchand's first Hindi novel, Sevasadan is a bold statement on the political and religious debates about marriage, sexuality, and prostitution, at a time when Indian women were being held up as standard-bearers of a nation in chains. Premchand depicts the hypocrisy of the so-called 'pillarsof society', who can stand up as upholders of moral platitudes in public yet sacrifice their orthodox principles behind closed doors. The novel portrays the reality of the newly emerging Hindu-Muslim divide, but also conceives of an ideal community that gives new direction to the life of a fallenwoman and allows her to lead a meaningful existence. A hugely popular novel, Sevasadan went through several editions after its first publication in 1918. It is not only a gripping novel but also a sensitive and perceptive document on the lives of young urban men and women at the beginning of thetwentieth century. The perceptive and analytically rich introduction by Vasudha Dalmia helps situate the novel in the socio-political content of the times. The book will appeal to students of literature and translation studies, as well as general readers.	2008	Oxford University Press						ZZZ000000
9780195625608	Shikwa and jawab-i-shikwa	Muhammad Iqbal		Though much of Iqbal's best poetry is written in Persian, he is also a poet of colossal stature in Urdu. Shikwa (1909) and Jawab-i-Shikwa (1913) extol the legacy of Islam and its civilising role in history, bemoan the fate of Muslims everywhere, and squarely confront the dilemmas of Islam in modern times. Shikwa is thus, in the form of a complaint to Allah for having let down the Muslims and Jawab-i-Shikwa is Allah's reply to the poet's complaint.	1990	Oxford University Press						ZZZ000000

9780195696349	The broken road	Alfred Edward Woodley Mason		A.E.W. Mason's The Broken Road is the fourth novel in the 'Lesser-known Raj Fiction' series edited by Ralph Crane. A gripping adventure romance of the Frontier first published in 1907, The Broken Road tells of the building of the Road, and, through the relationship between the two main characters, Dick Linforth, scion of a family of Empire-builders, and Shere Ali, the Prince of Chiltistan, compellingly explores the sense of duty that drove successive generations of British men tosacrifice their lives to the goals of Empire, and the contentious issue of educating Indian princes in England. While undoubtedly reinscribing the image of a confident and secure empire characteristic of much Raj fiction of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the novel also offersunusual insights into the human cost-on both sides of the racial divide-of producing that image, making it of significant interest to readers interested in colonial and postcolonial literatures, as well as general readers. This new, critical edition of The Broken Road, which includes a detailed introduction, a chronology of A.E.W. Mason's life, maps, and extensive explanatory notes, makes available a fascinating work of Raj fiction.	2008	Oxford University Press						ZZZ000000

The collection contains over 130 works by twelve poets, including Nissim Ezekiel, Jayanta Mahapatra, A.K. Ramanujan, Keki N. Daeruwalla, and Vikram Seth. Many of the poets chosen either present new facets of recongnized faces, or deliberately differ from those repeatedly represented in standard anthologies. Good poems in English by Indians have appeared sporadically for perhaps a century; consistently good Indian poets writing in English have appeared essentially in the last four decades; and a small group of significant new voices in the past few years has deemed necessary a carefully defined picture of the state of the art. This collection will be attractive to anyone interested in contemporary poetry, and in poetic usages of English in contemporary India.	1992	Oxford University Press						ZZZ000000

9780195699944	Wedding album	Girish Raghunath Karnad		Wedding Album, the latest play written by renowned playwright Girish Karnad, is a hilarious and moving spectacle that is deeply revelatory about the India that we live in today. The central characters of this play portray the modern, middle-class, Indian family: a daughter who lives inAustralia with her husband and children, a son who is a media professional, a younger daughter who is willing to marry a 'suitable' boy from the U.S. whom she has never met, a doting mother, an aging father rapidly losing his authority, and a loyal cook.Wedding Album operates at two levels: it explores the traditional Indian wedding in a globalized, technologically-advanced India even as it juxtaposes the very different life experiences and expectations of the family and the loyal cook. By doing this, Karnad reveals how particular notions ofwealth, well-being, sexual propriety, tradition, and modernity form the basis of middle-class society in contemporary India. This play has already been staged at numerous venues and was translated by Karnad himself from Kannada into English. An outstanding addition to OUP's corpus of plays by Girish Karnad, this volume will be of value not only to students and teachers of modern Indian drama, but also to generalreaders.	2009	Oxford University Press						ZZZ000000

It is an anthropological attempt to reach behind the surface of the contemporary Dalit movement. Some of the topics discussed are thekind of discourses found among Dalit activists, the organizational structure of the movement, and the local practices among activists.This study also relates the method of anthropological fieldwork to theories about social movements. It offers a historical context as a prerequisite to understanding processes in the contemporary Dalit movement. It focuses on the heterogeneity and the geographical spread of the movement. Thefieldwork moves from a small locality of Dalits in Lucknow to interaction with Dalit activists in Maharashtra to the life of Punjabi Dalit migrants in Birmingham.	2010	Oxford University Press						ZZZ000000
9780195651904	Conflict Unending,India-Pakistan Relations Since 1947	Sumit Ganguly		Since their emergence as independent states from the British colonial empire, India and Pakistan have gone to war four times. A detailed explanation of the Indo-Pak conflict has been laid out in this book that attributes it to three distinct components. The first is the divergent ideological commitments of the nationalist elites in the India and Pakistan anti-colonial movements. The second component is Pakistan's irridentist claim to Kashmir. The final component lies in the opportunistic events that act as immediate precipitants to war in the region.	2002-01-01	Oxford University Press						ZZZ000000

9780195633634	Gandhi and his critics	Bal Ram Nanda		Written for all those whose curiosity about Gandhi was sparked by Richard Attenborough's film, or for anyone who would like to know more about this strangely enigmatic leader, this is a fascinating in-depth study of Gandhi's personality and thought.

9780195692969	Local Governance in India,Decentralization and Beyond	Niraja Gopal Jayal&Pradeep Sharma		This volume analyses the complexity of local governance, both rural and urban, in contemporary India. It argues that there is more to local governance today than a focus on decentralization. The essays illuminate some of the lesser known aspects of the interface between panchayats and other institutions of local governance, whether district administration or parastatal agencies and civil society organizations. Sections in the book look at the relationship between these institutions and panchayats, sectoral experiences in health and primary education, local governance in the urban and rural setting, and finally issues of transparency, representation and accountability in local governance. Providing a unique analytical perspective to the issue of local governance in India, this volume will be useful to political scientists, sociologists, activists and bureaucrats in local governance mechanisms.	2007-12-30	Oxford University Press, USA						ZZZ000000

9780195667547	Pokhran and beyond,India's nuclear behaviour	Ashok Kapur		This book examines India's nuclear position in the context of its domestic politics, exploring how the position challenges India's interests and values within the regional and international environment. It points to the militarization of Indian nuclear and space science, arguing that external pressures stimulated Indian nationalism and led to a dramatic change in Indian political and social thought about strategic affairs. Kapur asserts that the new Indian approach is to specify Indian strategic priorities and agenda, demonstrate political will by military and political action, bear and inflict costs on rivals, and engage the world through power politics rather than disarmament talks.	2003-08-01	Oxford University Press						ZZZ000000
9780198064183	Political Hinduism,the religious imagination in public spheres	Vinay Lal		Political Hinduism opens up new and productive lines of inquiry, gesturing at forms of public religiosity that are not bound to the fanaticisms with which religions today are increasingly associated. It includes essays by leading scholars in the fields of anthropology, history, linguistics, politics, and religion such as Madhav M. Deshpande, Roby Rajan, J. Reghu, Julius J. Lipner, Joanne Punzo Waghorne, Jyotirmaya Sharma, Ajay Skaria, Paula Richman, and Ronald Inden. They explore the relationship of Hinduism to literature and cinema, and revisit familiar figures to arrive at fresh and even radically new readings. Political Hinduism thus addresses issues of tremendous topical relevance: the transmission of Hinduism to the United States, Gandhiji's religious politics and secularism, analysis of 'Vande Mataram' and its immensely rich history, C. Rajagopalachari's multiple tellings of the Ramkatha, popular patriotism in Hindi cinema, and much more. With an insightful Introduction by Vinay Lal, this book will be invaluable to students and teachers of politics, sociology, history, and media and cultural studies, as well as general readers interested in learning more about the negotiations between religion and politics in India.	2009	Oxford University Press						ZZZ000000

9780198064114	Postmodern Gandhi and Other Essays,Gandhi in the World and at Home	Lloyd I. Rudolph&Susanne Hoeber Rudolph		Postmodern Gandhi brings together eight seminal essays on Gandhi by the Rudolphs, two of the most well known names in South Asian studies in the US. Divided into two sections, the underlying theme of the volume is the continuing relevance and importance of Gandhi and his ideas. The book argues against equating Gandhism with traditionalism and seeks to establish Gandhi's credentials as a postmodern thinker. In this venture the book looks to strong counter cultural explanations to articulate Gandhian alternate conceptions of modernity. The authors contend that Gandhi was a practitioner, an activist and a theorist. The volume also examines Gandhi's interpretation of the world and compares the inherent ideas in Nehru's high modernist vision and Gandhi's critiques of it to end with an examination of what development meant to each of them.	2009	Oxford University Press						ZZZ000000

9780198063599	The Long Shadow	Muthiah Alagappa		The Long Shadow is the first comprehensive examination of the roles and implications of nuclear weapons in the post-Cold War security environment, focusing on a broadly defined Asian security region. It investigates the strategies for the employment of nuclear weapons, and the consequences for security and stability in a dramatically altered strategic landscape, and a substantially different nuclear environment. The canvas of study includes the six nuclear weapon states China, India, Israel, Pakistan, Russia, and the US; several nuclear weapon-capable states Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan; and the aspirants Iran and North Korea. A key conclusion of the study is that nuclear weapons influence national security strategies in fundamental ways; and that deterrence continues to be the dominant role and strategy for the employment of nuclear weapons. It further infers that although there could be destabilizing situations, on balance nuclear weapons have reinforced security and stability in the Asian security region. As nuclear weapons will persist in the foreseeable future, it is important to re-examine old ideas, concepts, and strategies, and develop new ones relevant for the contemporary era. In line with this, the global nuclear order should be constructed anew based on present realities.

9780195699395	The myth of the shrinking state,globalization and the state in India	Baldev Raj Nayar		This study investigates the nature of the impact of globalization on the Indian state. It takes as its point of departure the thesis, set out in the introductory essay, that globalization has resulted in the erosion of the economic and welfare roles of the state.According to the author, the shift to liberalization, the resurgence of the private sector, and the acceleration of growth rate paradoxically "empowered" and "enabled" the state. He argues that the examination of the quantitative data strongly points to the continued expansion of the economic and welfare roles of the state, rather than decline. Therefore, the retrenchment of the state does not have much merit. He emphasizes on the fundamental continuity in the key functions of the state. He concludes by saying that the state is lagging behind in the areas of internal security, education and health, and makes suggestions for institutional reforms.	2009	Oxford University Press						ZZZ000000

9780195699456	Twilight of the Tigers,Peace Efforts and Power Struggles in Sri Lanka	Peiris		This study is focused on the political vicissitudes of Sri Lanka since the initiation in December 2001 of a ceasefire that sought to end the violent confrontation between the 'Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam' and the security forces of the government of Sri Lanka. The aim was to pave the way for a negotiated settlement between the Sinhalese and the Sri Lankan Tamils-75 per cent and 12 per cent respectively of the national population--which originated in the early years of independence from the British rule. More than a detailed account of events and trends, this work is an exercise in both synthesis and analysis. Its interpretations converge on the theme that the belief in the possibility of achieving peace through negotiation with the LTTE has all along been an illusion. The book shows that the ceasefire did not mark a cessation of hostilities but only a dip in the intensity of the battle-field violence.	2009	Oxford University Press, USA						ZZZ000000
9780195666113	The Anthropology of Buddhism and Hinduism,Weberian Themes	David N. Gellner		Max Weber's ideas have had enormous influence in theoretical sociology. But what he wrote about Asia has more often been cited by specialists to illustrate his errors rather than to derive inspiration. This collection of essays both engages with Max Weber's work, and attempts to use his general approach, combined with detailed ethnography from Nepal and Japan, to attack critical questions in the anthropology and sociology of Buddhism and Hinduism. These range from the relationship of Buddhist religious specialists (monks and priests) to shamanic practitioners, to the way in which Brahmanical ideals have spread through history and are expressed in a traditional Hindu city, to the question of how to frame sociological comparisons between similar religious systems in different cultures.	2003-11-17	Oxford University Press						ZZZ000000
9780198065104	Modern Myths, Locked Minds,Secularism and Fundamentalism in India	T. N. Madan		Secularism is one of the important and contentious public debates in India today. It is seen to be in greater crisis now than ever before, making a case for the continuing presence of this book. The debate also furnishes the making of Indian polity and society, given the inter-related development of culture, society and politics in India. It is thus a debate about religious nationalism and fundamentalism as well. Modern Myths, Locked Minds examines the ideologies of secularism and fundamentalism in the setting of the religious traditions of India--Hinduism, Sikhism, and Islam. Further insightful comparison of the traditions is offered, each seen over a long period of time, revealing markedly distinctive historical experiences. This second, paperback edition comes with a new preface where the author revisits this debate and contemporarizes it for the reader. Also included are two new appendices on secularism.	2009	Oxford University Press						ZZZ000000

9780195648485	Contested Hierarchies,A Collaborative Ethnography of Caste Among the Newars of the Kathmandu Valley, Nepal	David N. Gellner&Declan Quigley		In this book, six anthropologists pool their knowledge of the three ancient Newar cities of Kathmandu, Lalitpur, and Bhaktapur, and of other settlements nearby. The social institutions of all the main caste groups--priests, patrons, artisans, farmers, and low castes--are given extended consideration, and the study is framed by a historical introduction and a comparative conclusion. In addition, it is well illustrated with fascinating black and white photos which have been specially taken to illustrate aspects of the society under study. The result is the most complete description and analysis yet of a regional caste system. The book should appeal not only to students of Hinduism and South Asia, but to all anthropologists and comparative sociologists interested in the interrelations of politics, ritual, kinship, economy, and ideology in complex, pre-industrial societies.	1999-10-29	Oxford University Press						ZZZ000000

9780195671360	In the belly of the river,tribal conflicts over development in the Narmada Valley	Amita Baviskar		This book provides an account of the lives of Bhilala adivasis in the Narmada valley who are fighting against displacement by the Sardar Sarovar dam in Western India. On the basis of intensive fieldwork and historical research, this study places the tribal community in the context of its experience of state domination. The author challenges current theories of social movements which claim that a cultural critique of the "development" paradigm is writ large in the political actions of those marginalized by "development"--adivasis who lived in harmony with nature, combining reverence for nature with the sustainable management of resources. The complexity of adivasi politics cannont be reduced to an opposition between "development" and "resistance." The book forces us to re-examine the politics of representation within the ideology of progressive movements. It will be of equal interest to scholars and social activists concerned about development environment, and indigenous peoples.	2004-06-24	Oxford University Press						ZZZ000000

9780195697339	Marxism and Class Analysis	Andre Beteille		Marxism has played a crucial role--directly and indirectly--in the development of social analysis in India. This collection of essays addresses the contemporary significance of Marxism in the study of economy and society. The problems of inequality, class and conflict in India are discussed with special reference to its agrarian social structure. Marxism has often been identified with what is described as the 'class approach' to society. While recognizing the great historical and contemporary relevance of class, the essays in the substantive part of the book also deal with other sources of inequality and conflict, and their relationship with class. The analysis brings out the diverse and changing meanings of class even within the Marxist tradition. It also presents accounts of inequality and conflict at various levels of society: village, district and region. It provides an overview of the changes that have taken place in the concept of class and in approaches to its study in response to changes in society between the time of Marx and our time.	2008	Oxford University Press, USA						ZZZ000000

9780195658699	Reversing the gaze,Amar Singh's diary, a colonial subject's narrative of Imperial India	Amar Singh&Susanne Hoeber Rudolph&Lloyd I. Rudolph&Mohan Singh Kanota		Amar Singh reverses the gaze. A colonial subject contemplates an imperial other. He begins writing at twenty, producing over forty-four years what may be one of the world's longest continuous diaries. These selections from the years 1898 to 1905, are the work of the young Amar Singh. He records his sense of discovery and surprise at diverse sites - the Jodhpur court, the women' quarters of the Jaipur haveli, Lord Curzon's Imperial Cadet Corps. In daily negotiations with his British and Rajput counterplayers, he constructs a hybrid self, a Rajput nobleman and an Edwardian officer and gentleman. Through daily entries, the reader experiences the immediacy of Amar Singh's subjective knowledge. Threatened by the boredom of princely state and raj philistinism, Amar Singh writes to 'keep myself amused'. His diary becomes an alter ego. He writes about culture in the making as well as in the doing. In an era that seems more comfortable with the subjective truths of agency and voice than with the objective truths of structural determination or formal analysis, Amar Singh's reflexive narrative offers an open ended, constructivist explanation of history and self.	2005-12-15	Oxford University Press						ZZZ000000

It also examines the broader implications of their story for a world awash with refugees.	2005-05-01	Oxford University Press						ZZZ000000
9780195629590	Urbanization and urban systems in India	R. Ramachandran		This substantive and original contribution to the study of urbanization in India critically analyses the strengths and weaknesses of the Indian urban system and provides new insights into contemporary urban problems. The author's perspective of urban development in India interrelates the geographical dimension with historical and socio-economic aspects. The book focuses on the processes of urbanization and the nature of interdependence among urban centres and between urban centres and their hinterlands. The approach is at the macro level. The first chapter provides an overview of studies of urbanization in India, and a detailed chapter on the history of urbanization follows. These provide the necessary background to the chapter on urbanization processes. The locational aspects of urbanization are covered in the next five chapters which discuss the problem of defining an urban place, spatial patterns of urbanization, classification of cities, theories of settlement location and the analysis of settlement systems. The relationships between a city and its surrounding area are then studied at two levels - the larger area of city dominance and the city fringe area. Finally, the author examines the fundamental issues involved in framing a national urbanization policy, and expresses the hope that the development of smaller cities and towns may provide some relief from the problems of overcrowding and unplanned growth.	1992-02-06	Oxford University Press						ZZZ000000
9780195699340	Violence, Martyrdom, and Partition,A Daughter's Testimony	Nonica Datta		This book presents the oral testimony of Subhashini (1914-2003), the woman head of a well-known Arya Samaj institution devoted to women's education in rural north India. Subhashini's narrative unfolds a story, within a sea of stories, which has remained silent in the dominant historical discourse. Her memory evokes contrasting images of violence, martyrdom and Partition. Not 1947 but 1942--the year of her father's 'martyrdom'--is recalled as a violent rupture in her memory. Partition is a moment of celebration, revenge, divine retribution, empathy, remorse, tragedy and fear.  Translating Subhashini's oral testimony, Nonica Datta recreates the memory of a colonial subject, living in postcolonial times, as a historical narrative. Moving beyond a historical event and well-established historical facts, Violence, Martyrdom and Partition is a parallel history of events and non-events, memory and history, testimony and experience. Breaking the silence of an oral testimony and presenting memory as history, this work opens up the historians' territory. This testimony defies the opposition between subject and agent, victim and victimizer, witness and survivor, aggressor and spectator, perpetrator and bystander. Subhashini's candid, repetitive narrative suggests a remarkable interplay of individual and collective remembrance, and reveals the shifts, ambiguities, silences and contradictions in an individual memory.	2009-03-12	Oxford University Press						ZZZ000000

9780195686470	India and Central Asia,commerce and culture, 1500-1800	Scott Cameron Levi		"Most scholarly works and textbooks characterize the medieval Indo-Central Asian relationship as more or less unidirectional and violent defined by successive waves of aggressive Turko-Afghan Islamic invasions of a passive Hindu India. They also tend to overlook the peaceful exchange of people,ideas, and material goods. Departing from the traditional scholarship, this reader, the eighth in the Debates in Indian History and Society series, provides new insights into India-Central Asia relations between the sixteenth and nineteenth centuries." "Did India's relationship with Central Asia grow during the period under consideration or falter? Were cultural or commercial connections more significant? India and Central Asia raises some important questions. In an incisive Introduction, Scott C. Levi examines the key contours of various debates and the changing historiographical perspectives. He also investigates areas where new issues have emerged, and others that need further investigation." "The book is divided into two parts. The first section on commercial relations deals with Mughal-Uzbeg relations, trade patterns, commodity structure, merchant networks and the Indian diaspora. It conclusively questions the notion that Indo-Asian trade suffered a general decline. Highlighting active socio-religious connections, the second part discusses the Central Asian heritage of the Mughal rulers, Fargana's contacts with India, and the Impact of Central Asian Sufism on Islam in India. It also explores Perso-Islamic cultural exchanges and cross..fertilization in the field of literature, painting, religion, and astronomy."--BOOK JACKET.	2007	Oxford University Press						ZZZ000000

9780195684346	Hyderabad,a biography	Narendra Luther		"In this book, the romantic story of the city of Hyderabad evolves into the history of a former princely state, and later, of Andhra Pradesh. Starting with the period prior to the birth of the city in 1591, Hyderabad : A Biography presents an unbroken and colourful chronicle of one of India's most legendary cities." "Envisioned by its founder, Mohammad Quli Qutb Shah as a 'replica of heaven on earth', Hyderabad was razed to the ground by Aurangzeb after the longest siege of his life. Rising from its ruins, it became the capital of the Deccan - the largest province of the Mughals. In the eighteenth century, it superceded Delhi as the epicenter of Indian politics." "Two centuries later, it emerges dramatically from its feudal position to become the capital of the first linguistic state of India.

9780195669800	Rabindranath Tagore,a biography	Uma Dasgupta		Nobel Prize laureate Rabindranath Tagore (1861-1941) is known to us today primarily as a poet and litterateur. Not many people, though, are aware of the vital significance of his efforts in the field of education and rural reconstruction. He loved the people of his country and strove for therights of the rural poor to dignity and social justice. A pioneer in the field of education, he gave the last forty years of his life towards creating Visva-Bharati, an institution in rural Bengal, envisioned at the time as an Indian alternative to colonial education. This brief biography draws on the history of Visva-Bharati to sketch the relatively lesser known aspects of Rabindranath's life, namely, his work as an educator and rural reformer. It also deals, though less prominently with the poet and the writer within him. Its primary focus is the issues thatconcerned Rabindranath all his life and featured regularly in his writings, such as Indian history, nationalism and internationalism, racial humiliation and the search for self-esteem, education, religion, humanism and a Jiban-Debata or "Lord of Life." This biography includes an appendix of selectedletters by Rabindranath Tagore and will be of enduring interest to students as well as readers with an abiding interest in his life.	2004-06-01	Oxford University Press						ZZZ000000
9780195687125	Talking songs,Javed Akhtar in conversation with Nasreen Munni Kabir and sixty selected songs	Javed Akhtar&Nasreen Kabir		Is the universe infinite, or does it have an edge beyond which there is, quite literally, nothing? Do we live in the only possible universe? Why does it have one time and three space dimensions - or does it? What is it made of? What does it mean when we hear that a new particle has been discovered? Will quantum mechanics eventually break down and give way to a totally new description of the world, one whose features we cannot even begin to imagine?This book aims to give the non-specialist reader a general overview of what physicists think they do and do not know in some representative frontier areas of contemporary physics. After sketching out the historical background, A. J. Leggett goes on to discuss the current situation and some of the open problems of cosmology, high-energy physics, and condensed-matter physics. Unlike most other accounts, this book focuses not so much on recent achievements as on the fundamental problems at theheart of the subject, and emphasizes the provisional nature of our present understanding of things.	2007	Oxford University Press						ZZZ000000

9780195622560	The man-eating leopard of Rudraprayag	Jim Corbett		Most of Jim Corbett's books contain collections of stories that recount adventures tracking and shooting man-eaters in the Indian Himalaya. This volume, however, consists of a single story, often considered the most exciting of all Corbett's jungle tales. He gives a carefully-detailed account of a notorious leopard that terrorized life in the hills of the colonial United Provinces. This story represents Corbett's most sustained and unique effort.	1989-08-01	Oxford University Press						ZZZ000000
9780195654028	Prince of cats	Arjan Singh		The leopard is one of the most beautiful Great Cats in creation, and it is now endangered in many countries. This fact led Arjan Singh, the celebrated Indian wildlife expert to attempt a daring experiment: rear a leopard cub in his house and return it to the jungle. The story of how Arjan Singh taught Prince and then the twins Juliette, and Harriet the ways of the forest is enthralling from start to finish. Sharing his whole life with them, building then machans (tree platforms), walking the jungle tracks in their company, encouraging them to hunt, teaching them to disembowel their kills, he came to know the ways and character of the leopard as no man has before. His first great success came when Prince at last took to the jungle, fully rehabilitated. Not only did the author succeed in returning a hand-reared predator to the forest, he has debunked the myth that leopards are treacherous and unpredictable. On the contrary, he demonstrates the 'essential tranquility' of the leopard's temperament, and shows that it is only the animal's intelligence, combined with its capacity for effective retaliation when cornered which has given it a bad name.	2001-03-08	Oxford University Press						ZZZ000000
9780195629682	The second Jim Corbett omnibus	Jim Corbett		Jim Corbett is world famous for his classic man-eater stories.

Jungle Lore is the closest Corbett evercame to writing an autobiography, combining recollections of his earliest dayswith frank views on the need for conservation which were well ahead of theirtime. Finally, in Tree Tops, the only book Corbett set outside his belovedIndia, he captures the savage beauty of Kenya's wildlife as well as telling thestory of the royal visit of 1952, during which Princess Elizabeth learned shewas Queen.	2001-02-01	Oxford University Press						ZZZ000000

9780195648928	The Great Indian elephant book,an anthology of writings on elephants in the raj	Dhriti K. Lahiri-Choudhury		For centuries, elephants have been a source of wonder, fear, and fascination to man. While depiction of the elephant in art, sculpture and literature goes far back in time, this anthology focuses on the nineteenth century when the British Empire was on the ascendant in India, Burma and Sri Lanka, and colonial rulers began using the elephant in war and for transport, even as they were hunting it. This comprehensive collection includes excellent descriptions of these intelligent and sagacious animals in the wild, with rare insight into elephant behavior, anatomy and haunts, as well as the odd apocryphal story about them: is there really an elephant graveyard in Sri Lanka? Do elephants have extraordinary memories? Did a man-eating elephant actually exist? The book contains accounts by leading elephant-men--from Champion and sanderson to Samuel Baker and Symington--all from works no longer readily available. With fascinating photographs and drawings, this is an informative and delightful collection.	1999	Oxford University Press						ZZZ000000
9780195680003	The last Tiger,struggling for survival	Valmik Thapar		The royal Bengal tiger is on the verge of extinction. There have been other moments in the past when the tiger in India has been threatened. This book traces the history of such crises and conservation efforts to battle them from the nineteenth century right up to the present crisis. The tiger as a trophy has always been valued and its very abundance in the past has spelt terrible excesses against it. But the tiger has always had its champions and the continuities in theconservation efforts are intriguing. Thapar points out that the arguments used by British conservationists to interest politicians in its preservation mostly underlined its economic wisdom and Thapar has often used the same tactics himself! At two other moments in time in India's history as an independentnation, the tiger's existence has been threatened. Both were tided over by concerned, capable, and decisive political leadership at the helm of affairs. The first in fact saw the genesis of Project Tiger in 1973-the only proud moment in independent India's tiger conservation history. This time round the threat is different, more potent, and by far the most severe. Its use in Chinese medicine has replaced trophy hunting as the most potent threat to the tiger and organized and armed poaching andsmuggling gangs with international links operate fearlessly in many of our national parks.Thapar fears that issues of poverty and inequity have diluted the mission focus of the Task Force-constituted by the Prime Minister of India to deal with the crisis-of preventing the tiger's disappearance off India's map. He is convinced that the only solution is to create inviolate protected areas, to seal off the country's national parks forthwith as it were. He points out that tiger habitats form a very small percentage of India's land area and sealing them off from human populations issurely a tiny price to pay for conserving an invaluable and irreplaceable national heritage.	2006	Oxford University Press						ZZZ000000
9780195693560	Of Love, Nature and Devotion,Selected Songs of Rabindranath Tagore	Rabindranath Tagore&Kalpana Bardhan		This collection of Tagore's songs in translation, perhaps the largest to appear in a systematic form, aims at a holistic appreciation of this body of Tagore's literary creation. Arranged chronologically, this collection pays a lot of attention to the lyric's quality as poetry than to thesong's tune or melodic quality. The translations closely follow the original Bengali lyrics in formal structure (line arrangement, rhyming pattern, and exact wording) instead of using free verse, and phonetic transliteration of the original is provided alongside the faithful translation-this enablesone to immediately follow the artistry of the structure of expression in form and wording. Where the lyric had been transcreated by the poet himself, that is quoted before giving the translation that follows the original Bengali as closely as possible-something that will be of particular interest tostudents of translation studies. The fairly comprehensive Introduction and several carefully chosen articles on Tagore's songs would also help the reader to understand the songs as a very special, and rather unique, kind of poetry, quite apart from the general body of Tagore's poems. This editionwill appeal to those who know Tagore as also young readers, apart from students and scholars of Indian literature and translation studies.	2008-02-01	Oxford University Press						ZZZ000000
9780195695038	Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay,an intellectual biography	Amiya P. Sen		This book is a short, critical biography of Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay (1838-94), a major Bengali novelist and thinker, who, in many ways, determined the intellectual and cultural content of modern Indian nationalism, and modern Hinduism. Bankim Chandra was a successful civil servant andalso the first graduate to pass out from a modern Indian university. More importantly, however, he meaningfully contributed to the critical self-reflection of the English-educated Indian middle classes in response to the moral and intellectual challenges posed by the West. In doing so, BankimChandra shaped the nascent movement for Indian nationhood.The author, Amiya Sen, presents a lucid reading of Bankim Chandra's literary works that detail his social, political, and religious philosophy. He also discusses Bankim Chandra's extensive use of Hindu religious idioms and symbols, which antagonized the non-Hindus, thus diluting the substance of theunity that he envisaged for India.Part of the 'Modern Indian Greats' series, this book aims at familiarizing the reader with Bankim Chandra's literary works, as well as his religious and political ideas, and will interest students and scholars of modern Indian history and politics, as well as general readers.	2008-09-01	Oxford University Press						ZZZ000000

9780195633917	Three Mughal poets,Mir, Sauda, Mir Hasan	Khurshidul Islam&Ralph Russell		The three great poets presented in this volume - Mir, Mir Hasan and Sauda- lived in Delhi, or in its general vicinity, in the eighteenth century during atime of widespread violence and disaster. The Mughal Empire was crumbling anddisintegrating internally as the great feudal nobles fought among themselves forcontrol of the emperor. In this atmosphere of misery, demoralization, anddespair occurred the first major flowering of Urdu literature.Sauda, the first to be discussed, wrote poems in all the main classical forms,but he was an unequalled satirist in an age that cried for satire, and it isthat portion of his work that is considered here.Mir Hasan also was born in Delhi and probably lived there until after theoccupation, massacre, and looting of 1739, which occurred when he was aboutfourteen. Like his two contmporaries, he wrote in all the classical forms andexcelled in one, to which he devoted most of his effort. In his case it was themansavi, a long narrative poem in rhymed couplets often telling a love story.Mir, perhaps the greatest of the three, is, in the opinion of the authors, oneof the great love poems of world literature. His favourite form was the ghazal,a subtle and difficult one which the authors discuss in detail, giving numerousexamples.In presenting these Mughal poets, the authors have let the literature speak foritself wherever possible, adding a minimum of comment.(This is a paperback edition of the earlier hardback published in 1991.)	1994-05-01	Oxford University Press						ZZZ000000

Daniel&Bombay Natural History Society		This new title covers the curious world of reptiles and amphibians, both common and rare, found in the Indian faunal limits.

9780198064503	Natural History & The Indian Army	Daniel&Baljit Singh		This collection of articles by officers of the Indian Army records the contributions of the Army to natural history over a period of more than two hundred years. It builds on the premise that the study of the Indian subcontinent's natural history was more or less the exclusive preserve ofthese officers. Beginning with the fading years of the eighteenth century, the natural history - inclined officers of the Indian Army studied the flora and fauna, particularly the fauna, in their leisure hours and became experts on it. Their findings were recorded in various journals in the U.K.,and after 1886 mainly in the Journal of the Bombay Natural History Society.A valuable feature of this book is a pamphlet (the twenty-fifth article in the collection) sent to the Indian Government by the Army through the Society by Lieutenant Colonel Burton, which drew the attention of the former to the dire need to conserve the country's wildlife, and in due course saw theformation of the Indian Board for Wildlife. The book is thus a tribute to this remarkable aspect of the Indian Army which, apart from fighting in the field, fought a battle to conserve the country's wonderful and almost incomparable natural heritage spread over a zoogeographical area over thirty degrees of latitude encompassing almost everytype of climate met with in the world.	2009	Oxford University Press						ZZZ000000

9780195684186	The Illustrated Premchand,Selected Short Stories	Munshi Premchand&David Rubin		Consisting of twelve fully illustrated short stories, The Oxford India Illustrated Premchand looks at the village and the small town in India - focal points offering Premchand a fascinating stage for the interplay of diverse personalities. Human suffering, crushing poverty, and brutal exploitation by landowners, moneylenders, and others occupying positions of power (A Catastrophe, The Power of a Curse); caste snobbery, and gender discrimination (The Thakur's Well); the proverbial cunning of the peasant (The Road to Salvation) - these are some of the darker themes explored in the volume. But side by side we have stories celebrating the victory of renunciation over selfish temptation (Festival of Eid) and the close companionship of man and animal (The Story of Two Bullocks, January Night); gently satirizing human foibles (A Lesson in the Holy Life, My Big Brother); and often revealing the unpredictable nature of human behaviour (Penalty, A Car-Splashing, The Naive Friend). A virtual Chiaroscuro. Premchand continues to interest us today because the significance of his works extends far beyond his won era and its immediate context. The originality and clarity of his vision, and his ability to dramatize universal human problems reveal his deep compassion, humour, and psychological understanding of human nature. The book is designed to appeal equally to young readers who will find the stories interesting and the illustrations delightful, as also enthusiasts of Indian literature and culture, and general readers.	2006	Oxford University Press						ZZZ000000
9780195692525	The Oxford India Gandhi,essential writings	Gopalkrishna Gandhi		Divided into fourteen parts, The Oxford India Gandhi seeks to redeem Gandhi from the plaster-cast image of the Mahatma. Edited by Gopalkrishna Gandhi, the Governor of West Bengal, the volume is different from the other works based on Gandhi, by the very virtue of its being compiled by his grandson. It is Gandhis essential story in his words-the story of his life as he himself might have narrated to a restless grandson-a story expressed in speeches and articles, but also in diary entries, letters, and most importantly, in conversations. Though the book draws from the already existing volumes on Gandhi and his life, it manages to look beyond the mundane, oft-repeated details about him-into the little things that almost always went unnoticed. Gandhi, in his own writings, gave one the liberty of peeking into his "not-so-perfect" side, and this volume covers those aspects as well. Most works on Gandhi have played on his iconic status, but the current volume concentrates on showing that the Mahatma was after all human. An interesting read, it offers a look into the personal life of perhaps the Subcontinent's most public figure of all times. Including this astonishing range of themes addressed by Gandhi in thought and action is aimed at reaching out to a larger audience, including young readers.	2008	Oxford University Press						ZZZ000000
9780198060185	Kosambi Combined Methods in Indology and Other Writings	D. D. Kosambi&Brajadulal Chattopadhyaya		The Oxford India Collection is a series which brings together writings of enduring value published by OUP.This book examines rare and scattered essays, notes and reviews of D.D. Kosambi. He introduced pioneering perspectives and methods in Indological studies, written and published over almost thirty years. These writings cover an enormous range: text-edition and philology, religion, historicalreconstruction, archaeology and anthropology, considerations of method, and so on. Together they reflect an integrated framework which, in Kosambi's own characterization, was Marxist. Many of Kosambi's seminal ideas were worked out in great depth in these scholarly articles; published in differentjournals, in India and abroad, they have long remained outside the reach even of experts. By attempting to be a comprehensive anthology, the collection will for the first time enable readers to sample the versatility of Kosambi's work.The introduction by B.D. Chattopadhyaya explores the genesis, range, and significance of Kosambi's writings.	2009	Oxford University Press						ZZZ000000

9780199206889	Oxford English dictionary	Angus Stevenson&Lesley Brown		From the beginning, the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary was intended to be an abridgement of the full Oxford English Dictionary. The first editor, William Little, was appointed in 1902. He worked on it until his death in 1922, after which the dictionary was completed by H. W. Fowler, JessieCoulson, and C. T. Onions. The First Edition was published in 1933, in two volumes. The Second Edition, published in 1936, contained about 3,000 revisions and additions. The Third Edition (1944) contained an appendix of addenda and corrigenda, and this edition was reprinted several times with corrections and additions, the most significant being in 1973, with enlarged addenda (nowrunning to over 70 pages) and a major revision of all the etymologies. The New Shorter was prepared under the editorship of Lesley Brown 1980-1993. It was the first complete revision of the dictionary, being in fact not so much an overhaul of the existing text as a reabridgement of the OED and its Supplements. The Fifth Edition was published in 2002, and reverted tothe name Shorter Oxford English Dictionary to emphasize the link between this 2-volume dictionary and the original 20-volume OED. The Sixth Edition of the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary provides a complete update of this unique reference work. Based on the 20-volume Oxford English Dictionary, the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary contains an incredible one-third of the coverage of the Oxford English Dictionary, is justone-tenth of the size, and includes all words in current English from 1700 to the present day, plus the vocabulary of Shakespeare, the Bible and other major works in English from before 1700. The new edition, with a new introductory essay by language expert David Crystal on the History of English, includes 2,500 new words and senses, plus thousands of antedatings of existing words, drawing on the huge ongoing research project for the Oxford English Dictionary and the wealth ofinformation on language in use provided by the Oxford English Corpus. In addition, the work includes many new quotations from recent authors, a refreshed design, and a complete review of spelling forms and defining vocabulary, making it the most authoritative reference work available for both modernand historical English. This Deluxe Edition also contains a CD-ROM. The brand-new software features the full text of the dictionary and is designed to run on both Windows and Apple Macintosh computers. With an elegant interface providing quick and intutitive searching, it also has advanced searching facilities for in-depthexploration, allowing searching of the definitions, eytmologies, subject, geographical region of use, register, and source language, as well as the ability to limit searches by the date of a word's first recorded usage.

For each decade, Ayto offers an introductory essay identifying the main historical, cultural, and scientific currents, showing how they contributed new vocabulary to the language. For each decade, the book provides an alphabetical listing of words first recorded in that period. Ayto describes each word fully and explains its origins. A final section looks at vocabulary developments of the new millennium. Full of surprises, this book is at once a glimpse of the past and a treasure chest for word lovers.	2007	Oxford University Press						ZZZ000000

Arranging these quotes under more than 200 headings, from Actors and Acting (including Dorothy Parker's famous barb on Katherine Hepburn's Broadway debut, "She ran the whole gamut of the emotions from A to B") to Youth (such as Fran Lebowitz wry comment: "Remember that as a teenager you are at the last stage in your life when you will be happy to hear that the phone is for you"), Sherrin has left no turn unstoned to collect the sharpest, the wittiest, the wryest in quips, put-downs, and one-liners.

9780198610557	The Oxford dictionary of idioms	Judith Siefring		Did you know that 'flavour of the month' originated in a marketing campaign in American ice-cream parlours in the 1940s, when a particular flavour would be specially promoted for a month at a time? And did you know that 'off the cuff' refers to the rather messy practice of writing impromptu notes on one's shirt cuff before speaking in public? These and many more idioms are explained and put into context in this second edition of the Oxford Dictionary of Idioms. This vastly entertaining dictionary takes a fresh look at the idiomatic phrases and sayings that make English such a rich and intriguing language. A major new edition, it contains entries for over 5000 idioms, including 350 new entries and over 500 new quotations. The text has been updated to include many new idioms using the findings of the Oxford English Reading Programme, the biggest language research programme in the world.

For example: 'Rowling has not been asleep at the wheel in the three years since the last Potter novel, and I am pleased to report that she has not confused sheer length with inspiration.' - Guardian, 2003. 'I made the speech of a lifetime. I had them tearing up the seats and rolling in the aisles.' - P.G. Woodhouse, 1940. Many entries include boxed features which give more detailed background on the idiom in question. For example, did you know that 'taken aback' was adopted from nautical terminology that described a ship unable to move forward because of a strong headwind pressing its sails back against the mast? The text has been entirely redesigned so that it is both elegant and easy to use. Anyone interested in the quirky side of the English language will have hours of fun browsing through this fascinating and informative volume.	2005	Oxford University Press						ZZZ000000

9780192806826	The adventures of Tom Sawyer	Mark Twain&Peter Stoneley		'Tom was a glittering hero once more - the pet of the old, and the envy of the young...There were some that believed he would be President yet, if he escaped hanging.' In this enduring and internationally popular novel, Mark Twain combines social satire and dime-novel sensation with a rhapsody on boyhood and on America's pre-industrial past. Tom Sawyer is resilient, enterprising, and vainglorious. In a series of adventures along the banks of the Mississippi, he usually manages to come out on top. From petty triumphs over his friends and over his long-suffering Aunt Polly, to his intervention in a murder trial, Tom engages readers of all ages. He has long been a defining figure in the American cultural imagination. Alongside the charm and the excitement, Twain raises serious questions about community, race, and the past. Above all, the book invites discussion of the way in which childhood is invoked to counter the uncomfortable truths of the adult world.	2007	Oxford University Press						ZZZ000000

9780192832948	Four Restoration libertine plays	Deborah Payne Fisk&Thomas Shadwell&Sir George Etherege&Thomas D'Urfey&Thomas Otway		These four plays in the Oxford English Drama series capture the range of responses to the fashionable and daring libertine movement in the second half of the seventeenth century. A Fond Husband and Friendship in Fashion are lesser-known comic gems of the Restoration stage; The Man of Mode is Etherege's masterpiece, and The Libertine is Shadwell's experimental and dark version of the Don Juan story.

9780192840479	George Eliot	Tim Dolin		In a landmark essay, Virginia Woolf rescued George Eliot from almost four decades of indifference and scorn when she wrote of the "searching power and reflective richness" of Eliot's fiction. Novels such as Middlemarch and The Mill on the Floss reflect Eliot's complex and sometimes contradictory ideas about society, the artist, the role of women, and the interplay of science and religion. In this book, Tim Dolin examines Eliot's life and work and the social and intellectual contexts in which they developed. Part of the Authors in Context series, George Eliot is a lively, accessible, and critically topical account of Eliot's novels in relation to the age in which she lived, and in modern contexts such as film and television. It is the ideal companion volume to Eliot's novels. The book combines biography, history, and critical thinking to illuminate Eliot's writing. Dolin's writing is fresh and original, and he is particularly good at explaining Eliot's complex philosophical ideas and the philosophy that informs her novels in a clear and straightforward fashion. The final chapter looks at recent TV adaptations of Middlemarch and Daniel Deronda to show how modern contexts inform our reading and interpretation.	2005	Oxford University Press						ZZZ000000
9780199297528	Journals,Captain Scott's last expedition	Robert Falcon Scott&Max Jones		In January 1912, Britain's Captain Robert F. Scott reached the South Pole, only to find he had been beaten by Roald Amundsen's Norwegian expedition. Scott and his companions faced an 850-mile march to safety. All perished on the return. A few months later, a search party found Scott's body and the journals that told his tragic story. Scott's own account was published to extraordinary acclaim in 1913. This new edition draws on ninety years of reflection on the Antarctic disaster to illuminate Scott's journals, publishing for the first time a complete list of the changes made to Scott's original text. Drawing on previously unused papers from the John Murray archive, Max Jones tells the story of this remarkable book and charts the changing fortunes of Scott's reputation.

9780192839824	Kamasutra	Mallanaga Vatsyayana&Wendy Doniger&Sudhir Kakar		The Kamasutra is the oldest extant textbook of erotic love. But it is more than a book about sex. It is about the art of living--about finding a partner, maintaining power in a marriage, committing adultery, living as or with a courtesan, using drugs--and also, of course, about the many and varied positions available to lovers in sexual intercourse and the pleasures to be derived from each.  The Kamasutra was composed in Sanskrit, the literary language of ancient India, sometime in the third century, probably in North India. It combines an encyclopedic coverage of all imaginable aspects of sex with a closely observed sexual psychology and a dramatic, novelistic narrative of seduction, consummation, and disentanglement. Best known in English through the highly mannered, padded, and inaccurate nineteenth-century translation by Sir Richard Burton, the text is newly translated here into clear, vivid, sexually frank English. This edition also includes a section of vivid Indian color illustrations along with three uniquely important commentaries: translated excerpts from the earliest and most famous Sanskrit commentary (thirteenth century) and from a twentieth-century Hindi commentary, and explanatory notes by the two translators. The lively and entertaining introduction by translator Wendy Doniger, one of the world's foremost Sanskrit scholars, discusses the history of The Kamasutra and its reception in India and Europe, analyses its attitudes toward gender and sexual violence, and sets it in the context of ancient Indian social theory, scientific method, and sexual ethics. "[This] new translation is fascinating, thought-provoking and occasionally even amusing."--Salon.com	2003-02-13	Oxford University Press						ZZZ000000
9780199536009	Mrs Dalloway	Virginia Woolf&David Bradshaw		'Fear no more the heat of the sun.' Mrs Dalloway, Virginia Woolf's fourth novel, offers the reader an impression of a single June day in London in 1923. Clarissa Dalloway, the wife of a Conservative member of parliament, is preparing to give an evening party, while the shell-shocked Septimus Warren Smith hears the birds in Regent'sPark chattering in Greek. There seems to be nothing, except perhaps London, to link Clarissa and Septimus. She is middle-aged and prosperous, with a sheltered happy life behind her; Smith is young, poor, and driven to hatred of himself and the whole human race. Yet both share a terror ofexistence, and sense the pull of death. The world of Mrs Dalloway is evoked in Woolf's famous stream of consciousness style, in a lyrical and haunting language which has made this, from its publication in 1925, one of her most popular novels.	2008	Oxford University Press						ZZZ000000
9780192801548	Nostromo,a tale of the seaboard	Joseph Conrad&Jacques Berthoud&Mara Kalnins		One of the greatest political novels in any language, Nostromo reenacts the establishment of modern capitalism in a remote South American province locked between the Andes and the Pacific. In the harbor town of Sulaco, a vivid cast of characters is caught up in a civil war to decide whether its fabulously wealthy silver mine, funded by American money but owned by a third-generation English immigrant, can be preserved from the hands of venal politicians. Greed and corruption seep into the lives of everyone, and Nostromo, the principled foreman of the mine, is tested to the limit. Conrad's evocation of Latin America--its grand landscapes, the ferocity of its politics, and the tenacity of individuals swept up in imperial ambitions--has never been bettered. This edition features a new introduction with fresh historical and interpretative perspectives, as well as detailed explanatory notes which pay special attention to the literary, political, historical, and geographical allusions and implications of the novel. A map, a chronology of the narrative, a glossary of foreign terms, and an appendix reprinting the serial ending all complement what is sure to be the definitive edition of this classic work.	2007	Oxford University Press						ZZZ000000
9780192831477	Pierre et Jean	Guy de Maupassant&Julie Mead&Robert Lethbridge		Henry James's admiration for "this masterly little novel" has been echoed throughout the twentieth century by readers of Pierre et Jean. It marked a turning point in the development of French fiction, situated as it is between traditional social realism and the psychological novel. It isrecognized as a classic study of filial jealousy, triggered by one of the two brothers of its title finding himself the sole inheritor of the fortune of his mother's former lover. Pierre et Jean is set in Le Havre in the 1880s and is notable for its evocation of the Normandy coastline captured by the Impressionists. But Maupassant's greatest achievement is to have woven from this simple plot in a maritime context a brilliantly crafted exploration of the complexities at theheart of family life.	2001	Oxford University Press						ZZZ000000

This up-to-date edition covers recent developments in Hawthorne scholarship.	1998-05-01	Oxford University Press						ZZZ000000

Virginia WoolfVirginia Woolf was not the only writer to admire Mansfield's work: Thomas Hardy, D. H. Lawrence, and Elizabeth Bowen all praised her stories, and her early death at the age of thirty-four cut short one of the finest short-story writers in the English language.This selection covers the full range of Mansfield's fiction, from her early satirical stories to the subtly nuanced comedy of 'The Daughters of the Late Colonel' and the macabre and ominous 'A Married Man's Story'. The stories that pay what Mansfield calls 'a debt of love' to New Zealand are assharply etched as the European stories, and she recreates her childhood world with mordant insight. Disruption is a constant theme, whether the tone is comic, tragic, nostalgic, or domestic, echoing Mansfield's disrupted life and the fractured expressions of Modernism.This new edition increases the selection from 27 to 33 stories and prints them in the order in which they first appeared, in the definitive texts established by Anthony Alpers.	2008	Oxford University Press						ZZZ000000
9780199226344	The first emperor,selections from the Historical records	Qian Sima&Raymond Stanley Dawson&K. E. Brashier		'The following year Qin unified all under Heaven and the title of August Emperor was immediately adopted.' The short-lived Qin dynasty unified China in 221 BC and created an imperial legacy that lasted until 1911. The extraordinary story of the First Emperor, founder of the dynasty, is told in the Historical Records of Sima Qian, the Grand Historiographer and the most famous Chinese historian. He describes the Emperor's birth and the assassination attempt on his life, as well as the political and often brutal events that led to the founding of the dynasty and its aftermath. Sima Qian recounts the building of the Great Wall, the 'burning of the books', and the construction of the First Emperor's magnificent tomb, a tomb now world famous since the discovery of the terracotta warriors in 1974. Sima Qian's love of anecdote ensures that his history is never dull, and Raymond Dawson's fluent translation captures his lively and vivid style. Chronicling recent archaeological developments and questioning Sima Qian's biases, K. E. Brashier's preface highlights the importance of the Grand Historiographer's account and Dawson's translation in the twenty-first century.	2007	Oxford University Press						ZZZ000000
9780199536405	The Great Gatsby	F. Scott Fitzgerald&Ruth Prigozy		"He talked a lot about the past and I gathered that he wanted to recover something, some idea of himself perhaps, that had gone into loving Daisy. His life had been confused and disordered since then, but if he could once return to a certain starting place and go over it all slowly, he couldfind out what that thing was . . ." The Great Gatsby (1925), F. Scott Fitzgerald's masterpiece, stands among the greatest of all American fiction. Jay Gatsby's lavish lifestyle in a mansion on Long Island's gold coast encapsulates the spirit, excitement, and violence of the era Fitzgerald named 'the Jazz Age'. Impelled by his lovefor Daisy Buchanan, Gatsby seeks nothing less than to recapture the moment five years earlier when his best and brightest dreams - his 'unutterable visions' - seemed to be incarnated in her kiss. A moving portrayal of the power of romantic imagination, as well as the pathos and courage entailed in the pusuit of an unattainable dream, The Great Gatsby is a classic fiction of hope and disillusion. This edition is fully annotated with a fine Introduction incorporating new interpretation anddetailing Fitzgerald's struggle to write the novel, its critical reception and its significance for future generations.	2008	Oxford University Press						ZZZ000000

Talbot&Henrietta Leyser		'I wish to remain single, for I have made a vow of virginity.'This is the remarkable story of the twelfth-century recluse Christina, who became prioress of Markyate, near St Albans in Hertfordshire.

EventuallyChristina is supported by the abbot of St Albans, and her reputation as a person of great holiness spreads far and wide.Written with striking candour by Christina's anonymous biographer, the vividness and compelling detail of this account make it a social document as much as a religious one.

9780199536610	To the lighthouse	Virginia Woolf		'I am making up "To the Lighthouse" - the sea is to be heard all through it' Inspired by the lost bliss of her childhood summers in Cornwall, Virginia Woolf produced one of the masterworks of English literature in To the Lighthouse. It concerns the Ramsay family and their summer guests on the Isle of Skye before and after the First World War. As children play and adults paint, talk, muse and explore, relationships shift and mutate. A captivating fusion of elegy, autobiography, socio-political critique and visionary thrust, it is the most accomplished of all Woolf's novels. On completing it, she thought she had exorcised the ghosts of her imposing parents, but she had also brought form to a book every bit as vivid and intense as the work of Lily Briscoe, the indomitable artist at the centre of the novel.	2008	Oxford University Press						ZZZ000000
9780192804259	Meno and other dialogues	Plato&Robin Waterfield		A unique selection of four dialogues in which Plato considers virtue-- individual virtue as well as virtue as a whole-- and its definition.

Plato is a major figure in the history of Western philosophy, and these dialogues are an essential part of his work. Robin Waterfield is an acclaimed translator of Plato, Euripedes, Plutarch, and Aristotle. The introduction and notes explain the course of the four dialogues and analyze the philosophical importance of Socrates' questions and arguments, providing an invaluable aid to understanding for student and non-specialist alike.	2005-06-15	Oxford University Press						ZZZ000000

9780199539420	The art instinct,beauty, pleasure, & human evolution	Denis Dutton		In a groundbreaking new book that does for art what Stephen Pinker's "The Language Instinct" did for linguistics, Denis Dutton overturns a century of art theory and criticism and revolutionizes our understanding of the arts."""The Art Instinct" combines two fascinating and contentious disciplines--art and evolutionary science--in a provocative new work that will change forever the way we think about the arts, from painting to literature to movies to pottery. Human tastes in the arts, Dutton argues, are evolutionary traits, shaped by Darwinian selection. They are not, as the past century of art criticism and academic theory would have it, just "socially constructed."Our love of beauty is inborn, and many aesthetic tastes are shared across remote cultures--just one example is the widespread preference for landscapes with water and distant trees, like the savannas where we evolved. Using forceful logic and hard evidence, Dutton shows that we must premise art criticism on an understanding of evolution, not on abstract "theory." He restores the place of beauty, pleasure, and skill as artistic values.Sure to provoke discussion in scientific circles and uproar in the art world, "The Art Instinct "offers radical new insights into both the nature of art and the workings of the human mind.	2009	Oxford University Press US						ZZZ000000
9780195333053	Six-legged soldiers,using insects as weapons of war	Jeffrey Alan Lockwood		The emir of Bukhara used assassin bugs to eat away the flesh of his prisoners. General Ishii Shiro during World War II released hundreds of millions of infected insects across China, ultimately causing more deaths than the atomic bombs dropped on Japan. These are just two of many startling examples found in Six-legged Soldiers, a brilliant portrait of the many weirdly creative, truly frightening, and ultimately powerful ways in which insects have been used as weapons of war, terror, and torture.Beginning in prehistoric times and building toward a near and disturbing future, the reader is taken on a journey of innovation and depravity. Award-winning science writer Jeffrey A. Lockwood begins with the development of "bee bombs" in the ancient world and explores the role of insect-borne disease in changing the course of major battles, ranging from Napoleon's military campaigns to the trenches of World War I. He explores the horrific programs of insect warfare during World War II: airplanes dropping plague-infested fleas, facilities rearing tens of millions of hungry beetles to destroy crops, and prison camps staffed by doctors testing disease-carrying lice on inmates. The Cold War saw secret government operations involving the mass release of specially developed strains of mosquitoes on an unsuspecting American public--along with the alleged use of disease-carrying and crop-eating pests against North Korea and Cuba. Lockwood reveals how easy it would be to use of insects in warfare and terrorism today: In 1989, domestic ecoterrorists extorted government officials and wreaked economic and political havoc by threatening to release the notorious Medfly into California's crops.A remarkable story of human ingenuity--and brutality--Six-Legged Soldiers is the first comprehensive look at the use of insects as weapons of war, from ancient times to the present day."Both science and military history buffs will learn much from Lockwood, a self-described skeptic with a sense of humor." Publisher's Weekly, Oct. 2008Jeffrey A. Lockwood is Professor of Natural Sciences & Humanities at the University of Wyoming, where he teaches in the department of philosophy and in the MFA program in creative writing. An accomplished writer, his work has been included in the popular anthology Best American Science and Nature Writing, and he is winner of both a Pushcart Prize and the John Burroughs Award. He is the author of Grasshopper Dreaming: Reflections on Killing and Loving and Locust: The Devastating Rise and Mysterious Disappearance of the Insect that Shaped the American Frontier.	2009	Oxford University Press US						ZZZ000000
9780192892546	War	Lawrence Freedman		War, despite its indisputably horrific nature, has shaped the international system, prompted social and technological change, and inspired the arts. This insightful book captures fully the ubiquitous and multifaceted character of war, featuring accounts by generals, soldiers, historians, strategists, and poets, who consider conflicts from the Napoleonic Wars to Bosnia. Firsthand accounts vividly evoke the French infantry experience at Waterloo, a Union-Confederate skirmish at Gettysburg, the reflections of a German seaman at Jutland, one civilian's impressions of the Blitz, the trials of a Japanese doctor in the wake of the Atom Bomb's obliteration of Nagasaki, the confusion of Vietnam, and more. A broad range of questions are addressed: What are the causes of war? Which strategic as well as moral principles guide its conduct, and how have these changed? Has total war become unthinkable? What is the nature of contemporary conflict? How is war experienced by those on the front line? With contributions by leading scholars, and edited by one the most oft-quoted and prolific of military experts, this reader offers a deeper and more comprehensive understanding of one of humankind's oldest and most controversial preoccupations.	1994	Oxford University Press						ZZZ000000
9780195799880	A middle way to God	Garth Hallett		Charting a "middle way" between the extremes represented by Alvin Plantinga and Richard Swinburne, Garth Hallett explores the thesis that if belief in other minds is rational and true (as it surely is), so too is belief in God. He makes a strong case that when this parity claim is appropriately restricted to a single, sound other-minds belief, belief in God and belief in other minds do prove epistemically comparable. This result, and the distinctive path that leads to it, will interest students and scholars in philosophy of religion and theology.	2003-01	Oxford University Press						ZZZ000000

9780198731924	Language in society,an introduction to sociolinguistics	Suzanne Romaine		Why have 1500 separate languages developed in the Pacific region? Why do Danes understand Norwegians better than Norwegians understand Danish? Is Ebonics a language or a dialect?   Linguistics tends to ignore the relationship between languages and the societies in which they are spoken, while sociology generally overlooks the role of language in the constitution of society. In this book Suzanne Romaine provides a clear, lively, and accessible introduction to the field of sociolinguistics and emphasizes the constant interaction between society and language. She shows how our linguistic choices are motivated by social factors, and how certain ways of speaking come to be vested with symbolic value, drawing from evidence from studies of cultures and languages all over the world.   This new edition incorporates new material on current issues in the study of gender as well as other topics such as the linguistic dimension to the ethnic conflict in the Balkans, and the controversy over Ebonics in the United States.	2000-09-01	Oxford University Press						ZZZ000000

She has just moved into Villa Villekulla where she lives all by herself with a horse, a monkey, and a big suitcase full of gold coins. The grown-ups in the village try to make Pippi behave in ways that they think a little girl should, but Pippi has other ideas. She would much rather spend her days arranging wild, exciting adventures to enjoy with her neighbours, Tommy and Annika, or entertaining everyone she meets with her outrageous stories.Pippi thinks nothing of wrestling a circus strongman, dancing a polka with burglars, or tugging a bull's tail.Generations of children have fallen in love with Pippi Longstocking. Just like Tommy and Annika, readers are instantly charmed by her warmth and sense of fun.Astrid Lindgren's children's classic first appeared in 1945. Astrid once commented, 'I write to amuse the child within me, and can only hope that other children may have some fun that way, too.'

Gross		An unrivalled collection of literary gossip and intimate sidelights on the lives of the authors The dictionary defines an anecdote as 'a short account of an entertaining or interesting incident', and the anecdotes in this collection more than live up to that description.

9780195312058	Gluttony,The Seven Deadly Sins	Francine Prose		In America, notes acclaimed novelist Francine Prose, we are obsessed with food and diet. And what is this obsession with food except a struggle between sin and virtue, overeating and self-control--a struggle with the fierce temptations of gluttony. In Gluttony, Francine Prose serves up a marvelous banquet of witty and engaging observations on this most delicious of deadly sins. She traces how our notions of gluttony have evolved along with our ideas about salvation and damnation, health and illness, life and death. Offering a lively smorgasbord that ranges from Augustine's Confessions and Chaucer's Pardoner's Tale, to Petronius's Satyricon and Dante's Inferno, she shows that gluttony was in medieval times a deeply spiritual matter, but today we have transformed gluttony from a sin into an illness--it is the horrors of cholesterol and the perils of red meat that we demonize. Indeed, the modern take on gluttony is that we overeat out of compulsion, self-destructiveness, or to avoid intimacy and social contact. But gluttony, Prose reminds us, is also an affirmation of pleasure and of passion. She ends the book with a discussion of M.F.K. Fisher's idiosyncratic defense of one of the great heroes of gluttony, Diamond Jim Brady, whose stomach was six times normal size. "The broad, shiny face of the glutton," Prose writes, "has been--and continues to be--the mirror in which we see ourselves, our hopes and fears, our darkest dreams and deepest desires." Never have we delved more deeply into this mirror than in this insightful and stimulating book.	2006	Oxford University Press US						ZZZ000000
9780195166309	Sloth	Wendy Wasserstein		Here is a rollicking parody of the self-help genre, one that skewers the couch-bound, apathetic mentality so pervasive in America today. With tongue in cheek, Sloth guides readers step-by-step toward a life of noncommittal inertia. "You have the right to be lazy," writes Wasserstein. "You can choose not to respond. You can choose not to move." Readers will find out the importance of Lethargiosis--the process of eliminating energy and drive, the vital first step in becoming a sloth. To help you attain the perfect state of indolent bliss, the book offers a wealth of self-help aids. Readers will find the sloth songbook, sloth breakfast bars (packed with sugar, additives, and a delicious touch of Ambien), sloth documentaries (such as the author's 12-hour epic on Thomas Aquinas), and the sloth network, channel 823, programming guaranteed not to stimulate or challenge in any way. ("It may be difficult to distinguish between this and other channels, but only on channel 823 can you watch me sleeping.") Readers will also learn the top ten lies about Sloth, the ten commandments of Sloth, the SLOTH mantra, even the "too-much ten"--over-achievers such as Marie Curie, Shakespeare, and William the Conqueror. You will discover how to become a sloth in your diet, exercise, work, and even love-life (true love leads to passion, she warns, and passion is the biggest enemy of sloth). Wendy Wasserstein is one of America's great comic writers--one who always has a serious point to her humor. Here, as she pokes fun at the self-help industry, she also satirizes the legion of Americans who are cultural and political sloths.	2005	Oxford University Press US						ZZZ000000
9780195979800	The politics of Islamic finance	Clement M. Henry&Rodney Wilson		Can the contemporary Islamic finance movement be shown to meet the requirements of modern commerce? In the wake of the terrorist attacks on America the UN Security Council passed a resolution targeting transnational sources of terrorist funds. The United States and the International Monetary Fund are encouraging the governments of the Middle East to adopt policies of economic liberalism and a new type of capitalism, based on Islamic values and beliefs, is emerging.The aims of the book are:  to explore the political implications of the slow but steady accumulation of Islamic capital to analyse the connections between Islamic finance and Islamic political movements in Middle Eastern and North African countriesto show that the commonly-perceived connection between Islamic finance and money laundering and terrorism is by no means the complete picture.Readers will learn to appreciate the various political contexts in which Islamic finance operates in the Middle East and North Africa and will acquire some understanding of its political as well as economic constraints. Hopefully possible misunderstandings about Islamic banking and finance will be corrected.The book is divided into two parts - part one is thematic and lays the ground for the country-specific case studies in part two (covering the Sudan, Kuwait, Jordan, Turkey, Tunisia and Egypt). The contributors include political scientists, economists and historians. Key Features: A major topical issue Written by the world's leading experts on Islamic Political Economy Explores the connections between Islamic finance and Islamic political movements Includes country-specific case studies	2005	Oxford University Press						ZZZ000000
9780195181401	Truth and fiction in The Da Vinci code,a historian reveals what we really know about Jesus, Mary Magdalene, and Constantine	Bart D. Ehrman		A staggeringly popular work of fiction, Dan Brown's The Da Vinci Code has stood atop The New York Times Bestseller List for well over a year, with millions of copies in print. But this fast-paced mystery is unusual in that the author states up front that the historical information in the book is all factually accurate. But is this claim true? As historian Bart D. Ehrman shows in this informative and witty book, The Da Vinci Code is filled with numerous historical mistakes. Did the ancient church engage in a cover-up to make the man Jesus into a divine figure? Did Emperor Constantine select for the New Testament--from some 80 contending Gospels--the only four Gospels that stressed that Jesus was divine? Was Jesus Christ married to Mary Magdalene? Did the Church suppress Gospels that told the secret of their marriage? Bart Ehrman thoroughly debunks all of these claims. But the book is not merely a laundry list of Brown's misreading of history. Throughout, Ehrman offers a wealth of fascinating background information--all historically accurate--on early Christianity. He describes, for instance, the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls (which are not Christian in content, contrary to The Da Vinci Code); outlines in simple terms how scholars of early Christianity determine which sources are most reliable; and explores the many other Gospels that have been found in the last half century. Ehrman separates fact from fiction, the historical realities from the flights of literary fancy. Readers of The Da Vinci Code who would like to know the truth about the beginnings of Christianity and the life of Jesus will find this book riveting.	2004-10-27	Oxford University Press US						ZZZ000000
9780199217915	Trust,self-interest and the common good	Marek Kohn		Trust--whether between parents and children, merchants and shoppers, or citizens and their government--lies at the very heart of our relationships, our society, and our everyday lives.This vividly written compact book reveals how modern thinkers--scientists, social scientists, and philosophers--have shed much light on the nature of trust. Beginning with some fascinating evolutionary puzzles about the origins of trust--for instance, how cooperation can evolve among individuals pursuing their own selfish interests--Marek Kohn incorporates many different perspectives from the fields of science, sociology, economics, and politics, to draw out the wider implications for trust in human society today. The book discusses trust in gods and how people have sought to reinvest this trust as religious faith has diminished; the effect of low social trust on economic development; and the loss of trust between mutually antagonistic communities, each warming itself by the flames of its hostility to the other. He shows how Communism relied on distrust, and devoted much of its energy to seeding it among its subjects, and Liberal democracy is also based on distrust, but in the opposite direction: it is founded upon the suspicion that the powerful will be tempted to abuse their power, and so must be subject to checks and balances. Perhaps most important, he shows that if we understand what makes trust possible, and why it matters, then we will live better lives in a fast-moving, fast-changing, global society.Following in the footsteps of Oxford's highly popular books Happiness and Emotion, this compact book illuminates a precious and elusive quality that serves as the bedrock of a fulfilling life and the good society.Marek Kohn is Visiting Research Fellow, School of Life Sciences, University of Sussex and Honorary Faculty Fellow, School of Arts and Architecture, University of Brighton.	2008	Oxford University Press						ZZZ000000

9780195183702	Einstein's heroes,imagining the world through the language of mathematics	Robyn Arianrhod		Imagine you are fluent in a magical language of prophecy, a language so powerful it can accurately describe things you cannot see or even imagine. Einstein's Heroes takes you on a journey of discovery about just such a miraculous language--the language of mathematics--one of humanity's most amazing accomplishments. Blending science, history, and biography, this remarkable book reveals the mysteries of mathematics, focusing on the life and work of three of Albert Einstein's heroes: Isaac Newton, Michael Faraday, and especially James Clerk Maxwell, whose portrait hung on Einstein's laboratory wall and whose work directly inspired the theory of relativity. In this engaging book, Robyn Arianrhod bridges the gap between science and literature, portraying mathematics as a language and arguing that a physical theory is a work of imagination involving the elegant and clever use of this language. Her narrative centers on the work of Maxwell, the first scientist to embrace the ambiguous relationship between language and reality--the first to accept that, in a very real sense, language is reality. The heart of the book illuminates how Maxwell, using the language of mathematics in a new and radical way, resolved the seemingly insoluble controversy between Faraday's idea of lines of force and Newton's theory of action-at-a-distance. In so doing, Maxwell not only produced the first complete mathematical description of electromagnetism, but actually predicted the existence of the radio wave, something utterly unexpected, teasing it out of the mathematical language itself. Here then is a fascinating look at mathematics: its colorful characters, its historical intrigues, and above all its role as the uncannily accurate language of nature.	2005-01-24	Oxford University Press US						ZZZ000000
9780199213054	Freaks of nature,and what they tell us about development and evolution	Mark Samuel Blumberg		Two-legged goats, conjoined twins, 'Cyclops' infants with a single eye in the middle of their forehead, double-headed snakes, and Laloo, a man with a partially formed twin attached to his chest... In iFreaks of Nature/i, Mark S. Blumberg turns a scientist's eye on these unusual examples ofhumans and other animals, showing how a subject once relegated to the sideshow can help explain some of the deepest complexities of biology. These examples of extreme bodily anomalies are in fact the natural products of development, and it is through such developmental mechanisms that evolution works. And Blumberg shows how 'freak' deformities can provide valuable windows on the intimate connections between genetics, development, theenvironment, and evolution. In taking seriously a subject that has often been shunned as discomfiting and embarrassing, Freaks of Nature takes the perspective of evolutionary developmental biology to shed new light on how individuals--and entire species--develop, survive, and evolve.	2009	Oxford University Press						ZZZ000000
9780199205639	Terrors of the Table,The Curious History of Nutrition	Walter Gratzer		Here, Walter Gratzer offers a marvelous smorgasbord of stories taken from the history of nutrition, providing an engaging account of the struggle to find the ingredients of a healthy diet, and the fads and quackery that have waylaid the unwary. Gratzer recounts this history with characteristic crispness and verve. The book teems with colorful personalities, a veritable who's who of medical history, and highlights the brilliant flashes of insight as well as the sadly mistaken leaps of logic in the centuries-long effort to understand how the body uses food. We see the ingenious experiments used to reveal the workings of the stomach, the chemical analyses that uncovered the nature of proteins, carbohydrates, and vitamins, and the slow recognition that malnutrition lay behind such terrible diseases as scurvy, rickets, beriberi, and pellagra. Along the way, we read about the invention of the tin can (which originally had to be opened with a hammer and chisel), learn why ancient Egyptians had thicker skulls than Persians, and find out about today's fads and fancy diets--some dangerous, others just daft. Spiced with colorful anecdotes from the history of medicine and with sharp portraits of the scientists who helped or hindered our understanding of diet and digestion, Terrors of the Table is a must read for anyone interested in food and health.	2007-02-12	Oxford University Press						ZZZ000000
9780199230846	Why evolution is true	Jerry A. Coyne		For all the discussion in the media about creationism and 'Intelligent Design', virtually nothing has been said about the evidence in question - the evidence for evolution by natural selection. Yet, as this succinct and important book shows, that evidence is vast, varied, and magnificent, and drawn from many disparate fields of science. The very latest research is uncovering a stream of evidence revealing evolution in action - from the actual observation of a species splitting into two, to new fossil discoveries, to the deciphering of the evidence stored in our genome. Why Evolution is True weaves together the many threads of modern work in genetics, palaeontology,geology, molecular biology, anatomy, and development to demonstrate the 'indelible stamp' of the processes first proposed by Darwin. It is a crisp, lucid, and accessible statement that will leave no one with an open mind in any doubt about the truth of evolution.	2009	Oxford University Press US						ZZZ000000
9780198608585	The Oxford companion to cosmology	Andrew R. Liddle&Jon Loveday		Lavishly illustrated with almost two hundred halftones and diagrams, The Oxford Companion to Cosmology offers readers an engaging, state-of-the-art reference work on modern cosmology, the only such resource presently available. In more than 350 in-depth entries, Andrew Liddle and Jon Loveday--two authorities on theoretical and experimental cosmology--cover the entire scope of this cutting-edge field, from cosmic rays and dark energy to Higgs boson and neutrinos. Beginning with an introductory essay on Hot Big Bang Cosmology, the Companion illuminates the ideas behind our current understanding of the universe, outlines some of the fundamental physics from which those ideas emerge, and discusses the many strands of observational evidence available to the modern cosmologist. The authors tackle such fascinating topics as anti-matter, the age of the universe, black holes, quasars, radio galaxies, Superstring theory, and WIMPs (weekly interacting massive particles). The book also features biographical profiles of major scientists, from Arthur Eddington and Albert Einstein to George Gamow and Edwin Hubble, and informative entries on the tools of exploration such as the Cosmic Background Explorer satellite, the Hubble Space Telescope, and the Keck Observatory. Extensive cross-referencing allows readers to pursue ideas throughout the book, and web links direct the reader to recommended online resources.	2008-05-01	Oxford University Press						ZZZ000000
9780192861894	Hyperspace,a scientific odyssey through parallel universes, time warps, and the tenth dimension	Michio Kaku		Already thoroughly familiar to the seasoned science fiction fan, Hyperspace is that realm which enables a spaceship captain to take his ship on a physics-defying shortcut (or "wormhole") to the outer shores of the Galaxy in less time than it takes a 747 to fly from New York to Tokyo. But in the past few years, physicists on the cutting edge of science have found that a 10-dimensional Hyperspace may actually exist, albeit at a scale almost too small to comprehend, smaller even than a quark; and that in spite of its tiny size, it may be the basis on which all the forces of nature will be united. This is the first book for a general audience on one of the latest, most exciting developments in modern science. In the past several years, theoretical physicists--the author among them--have discovered that the universe exists not merely in the four spacetime dimensions (3 of space + one of time) with which Einstein made us familiar, but rather as a ten-dimensional Hyperspace. Once the domain of the science fiction writer or the occultist, Hyperspace has recently been shown to be the only kind of space in which the laws of modern physics can be satisfactorily explained. Amazingly enough, many of the phenomena whose explanations have stymied 20th century physicists and cosmologists can now be perfectly clarified by using the ten dimensions of Hyperspace. Most importantly, Einstein's unfulfilled dream, the work on which he spent the last several decades of his life in vain--the unification of all the forces of nature--now sits waiting on the ten-dimensional doorstep of modern theoretical physicists. Michio Kaku--theoretical high-energy physicist, author, radio talkshow host, and nuclear disarmament activist--is one of the pioneers in the field of String Theory, which states that the basic constituents of our universe are not quarks or protons or electrons, but much smaller entities called "strings" or "superstrings", which vibrate--like violin strings--in 10 dimensional Hyperspace, and whose vibrations in different resonances are manifested in the elementary particles. In his book, Kaku takes the reader on a ride through Hyperspace to the edge of physics. On the way he gives crystal clear explanations of such formidable mathematical concepts as non-Euclidean Geometry, Kaluza-Klein Theory, and Supergravity, the everyday tools of the string theorist. Utilizing fascinating and often hilarious anecdotes from history, from art, and from science fiction, Kaku shows us that writers and artists--in addition to scientists--have been fascinated by multidimensional space for over a century. In fact, many of the weird effects created by such famous artists as Dali and Picasso can be explained and more appreciated with an eye on the fourth spatial dimension. Finally, Kaku shows us why the ability to master Hyperspace may be our only salvation from destruction at the end of space-time. This lively yet authoritative book is spiced with many whimsical illustrations in a style reminiscent of the late science writer George Gamow.	1995-10-01	Oxford University Press						ZZZ000000
9780195166736	J. Robert Oppenheimer,a life	Abraham Pais&Robert P. Crease		The late Abraham Pais wrote the definitive biography of Albert Einstein, "Subtle is the Lord" which won an American Book Award. As a distinguished physicist and Einstein's colleague, Pais combined a sophisticated understanding of physics with first-hand knowledge of this notoriously private individual, offering rare insights into both. It is his unique double perspective that makes his work so valuable. Now, in Shatterer of Worlds, Abraham Pais offers an illuminating portrait of another eminent colleague, J. Robert Oppenheimer, one of the most charismatic and enigmatic figures of modern physics. Pais introduces us to a precocious youth who sped through Harvard in three years, made signal contributions to quantum mechanics while in his twenties, and was instrumental in the growth of American physics in the decade before the Second World War, almost single-handedly putting American physics on the map. Pais paints a revealing portrait of Oppenheimer's life in Los Alamos, where in twenty remarkable, feverish months, under his inspired leadership, the first atomic bomb was designed and built, a success that made Oppenheimer America's most famous scientist. Pais, who was his next-door neighbor for many years, describes Oppenheimer's long tenure as Director of the Institute of Advanced Study at Princeton, but also shows how Oppenheimer's intensity and arrogance won him powerful enemies, who would ultimately make him one of the principal victims of the Red Scare of the 1950s. Told with compassion and deep insight, Shatterer of Worlds is the most comprehensive biography of the great physicist available. It is Abraham Pais's final work, completed after his death by Robert P. Crease, an acclaimed historian of science in his own right.	2006	Oxford University Press US						ZZZ000000
9780199237784	Megadisasters,Predicting the Next Catastrophe	Florin Diacu		No one can forget the horrific images of the destructive power of the tsunami that engulfed Southeast Asia on Boxing Day in 2004, or the chaos wrought by Hurricane Katrina. Could these 'megadisasters' have been predicted?This book is about the science and mathematics that underlies efforts to understand and predict megadisasters. There are similarities in the variety of cataclysms that we are prone to, whether hurricanes, tsunamis, sudden changes of climate, or stock market crashes. These are all events that are associated with complex systems, with many variables, and their science and mathematics is that of 'chaotic systems'. Their behaviour is very difficult to predict. Other kinds of megadisasters are therisk of a massive asteroid impact, and the development of pandemics. Understanding and predicting these phenomena involve developing complex mathematical models, and we have a long way to go. In this book, Diacu describes the struggles of mathematicians and scientists over the centuries to get to grips with the nature of volcanoes, hurricanes, and other complex phenomena and prevent future tragedies. But he also includes human stories that remind us of their terrifying power and the experience of being caught up in them.	2009-09-17	Oxford University Press						ZZZ000000
9780192862167	The Nine Numbers of the Cosmos	Michael Rowan-Robinson		How old is the universe? What do the atoms in our bodies, our very existence, tell us about the history of the universe? How do galaxies form? Michael Rowan-Robinson answers these questions and encapsulates all that modern astronomy has discovered about the universe around nine numbers, onlyone of which is known with real precision, and four not at all. The reader emerges with a genuine feel for what we do really know about the universe--and also what we do not.The complicated ideas that constitute modern cosmology--the origin of the elements, the General Theory of Relativity, quantum theory, and the standard model of particle physics--are made accessible. Rowan-Robinson predicts that with the advent of the MAP and PLANCK-Surveyor space missions, theLarge Hadron Collider, and other planned experiments, all nine numbers will be accurately known by 2015. However, he stresses that many questions and mysteries will remain, and that the origin of the Big Bang could remain a mystery until the year 3000.Prologue: Que sais-je?1. We exist2.

Rowan-Robinson asks what we know about the universe. In answer, he has come up with nine numbers that summarize our current understanding of the cosmos. . . . [T]he numbers Rowan-Robinson presents are grounded in scientific research, although morethan a little speculation was used in deriving a couple of them. . . . His nine numbers relate to the density of baryonic matter, the anisotropy of the universe, the Hubble constant, the age of the universe, the temperature of the microwave background, the densities of cold dark matter and hot darkmatter, the cosmological constant and the star formation history of the universe. . . . [R]eaders should gain an excellent understanding of what we currently know about the universe and the techniques through which we have acquired that knowledge. . . . [T]he book is a good summary and will make auseful addition to general science collections."--Publishers WeeklyMichael Rowan-Robinson is Professor of Astrophysics and Head of the Astrophysics Group at Imperial College, London. He is an internationally recognized expert on observational cosmology and his book, The Cosmological Distance Scale, is regarded as a classic.	2001-11-15	Oxford University Press						ZZZ000000
9780195340143	The future of the MBA,designing the thinker of the future	Mihnea C. Moldoveanu&Roger L. Martin		The MBA is probably the hottest ticket among the current university graduate degree offerings--every year, more than 120,000 students enroll in MBA programs in the United States, and the estimates in Europe do not lag far behind. In addition, job prospects have never looked better for businessschool graduates; corporations are hiring more business school graduates every year, and compensating them more handsomely.The Future of the MBA provides a sorely needed detailed and systematic review of the major contemporary debates on management education. At the same time, it makes a striking new proposal that will certainly have an impact in business schools: that managers need to develop a series of qualitativetacit skills which could be appropriately developed by integrative curricula brought from different disciplines, including sociology, philosophy, and other social sciences. Moldoveanu and Martin, both involved in the greatly respected integrative business education program at the Rotheman School ofManagement, provide a guide on how to design a reliable integrated program for management students. One of the main assets of the book is that it relies not just on speculative thinking, but on real life experience, and that it also includes case studies that will appeal to practicing managers. Asan authoritative reference on MBA education, it will appeal to faculty and staff of business schools, as well as students in related fields like education and public policy.Mihnea C.

9780199558049	Debates on the measurement of global poverty	Sudhir Anand&Paul Segal&Joseph E. Stiglitz		The international community's commitment to halve global poverty by 2015 has been enshrined in the first Millennium Development Goal. How global poverty is measured is a critical element in assessing progress towards this goal, and different researchers have presented widely-varying estimates. The chapters in this volume address a range of problems in the measurement and estimation of global poverty, from a variety of viewpoints. Topics covered include the controversiessurrounding the definition of a global poverty line; the use of purchasing power parity exchange rates to map the poverty line across countries; and the quality, and appropriate use, of data from national accounts and household surveys. Both official and independent estimates of global poverty have proved tobe controversial, and this volume presents and analyses the lively debate that has ensued.	2010	Oxford University Press						ZZZ000000
9780199251414	Understanding financial crises	Franklin Allen&Douglas Gale		What causes a financial crisis? Can financial crises be anticipated or even avoided? What can be done to lessen their impact? Should governments and international institutions intervene? Or should financial crises be left to run their course? In the aftermath of the recent Asian financial crisis, many blamed international institutions, corruption, governments, and flawed macro and microeconomic policies not only for causing the crisis but also unnecessarily lengthening and deepening it.  Based on ten years of research, the authors develop a theoretical approach to analyzing financial crises. Beginning with a review of the history of financial crises and providing readers with the basic economic tools needed to understand the literature, the authors construct a series of increasingly sophisticated models. Throughout, the authors guide the reader through the existing theoretical and empirical literature while also building on their own theoretical approach. The text presents the modern theory of intermediation, introduces asset markets and the causes of asset price volatility, and discusses the interaction of banks and markets. The book also deals with more specialized topics, including optimal financial regulation, bubbles, and financial contagion.	2007	Oxford University Press						ZZZ000000
9780195477184	Between dreams and realities,some milestones in Pakistan's history	Sartaj Aziz		The political history of Pakistan is an illuminating record of the milestones and turning points that this nation has faced since its inception. In this comprehensive book, Sartaz Aziz explores the basic causes of the failure of democracy in Pakistan and proposes that only a genuine democratic dispensation -- not military rule with a civilian facade -- can ensure the country's survival as a viable federation. As Finance Minister under Nawaz Sharif and Foreign Minister during the Kargil crisis of 1999, Aziz bore witness to numerous key episodes in Pakistan's history. He was the main architect of many far-reaching reforms introduced in the early 1990s, and his retelling of the Kargil crisis is one of the most authentic and fascinating accounts of that conflict to date. In this book, he details how public policy is formulated in Pakistan and borrows from his insider's view of the Pakistan economy to argue that the vitality of a nation comes not only from economic progress and military might but also from shared values, cultural heritage and social energy.	2009	Oxford University Press						ZZZ000000
9780199239344	Conquest,how societies overwhelm others	David Day		The history of the world has been the history of peoples on the move, as they occupy new lands and establish their claims over them. Almost invariably, this has meant the violent dispossession of the previous inhabitants. Whether it is the Normans in England, the Chinese in Tibet, the Germans in Poland, the Indonesians in West Papua, or the British and Americans in North America, the claiming of other people's lands and the supplanting of one people by another has shaped the history of societies from the ancient pastto the present day. David Day tells the story of how this happened - the ways in which invaders have triumphed and justified conquest which, as he shows is a bloody and often prolonged process that can last centuries. And while each individual conquest is ultimately unique, nevertheless they often share a number ofqualities, from the re-naming of the conquered land and the invention of myth to justify what has taken place, to the exploitation of the conquered resources and people, and even to the outright slaughter of the original inhabitants. Above all, as Day shows in this hugely bold and ambitious book, conquest can have deep and long-lasting consequences - for the conquered, the conquerors, and for the wider course of world history.	2008	Oxford University Press US						ZZZ000000

9780199237432	Worlds at war,the 2,500-year struggle between East and West	Anthony Pagden		The differences that divide West from East go deeper than politics, deeper than religion, argues Anthony Pagden. To understand this volatile relationship, and how it has played out over the centuries, we need to go back before the Crusades, before the birth of Islam, before the birth ofChristianity, to the fifth century BCE.Europe was born out of Asia and for centuries the two shared a single history. But when the Persian emperor Xerxes tried to conquer Greece, a struggle began which has never ceased. This book tells the story of that long conflict. First Alexander the Great and then the Romans tried to unite Europe and Asia into a single civilization. With the conversion of the West to Christianity and much of the East to Islam, a bitter war broke out between two universal religions, each claiming world dominance. By the seventeenth century,with the decline of the Church, the contest had shifted from religion to philosophy: the West's scientific rationality in contrast to those sought ultimate guidance it in the words of God. The eighteenth and nineteenth centuries witnessed the disintegration of the great Muslim empires - the Ottoman, the Mughal, and the Safavid in Iran - and the increasing Western domination of the whole of Asia. The resultant attempt to mix Islam and Western modernism sparked off a struggle in theIslamic world between reformers and traditionalists which persists to this day. The wars between East and West have not only been the longest and most costly in human history, they have also formed the West's vision of itself as independent, free, secular, and now democratic. They have shaped, and continue to shape, the nature of the modern world.	2008	Oxford University Press US						ZZZ000000

9780195300086	What's it all about?,philosophy and the meaning of life	Julian Baggini		What is the meaning of life? It is a question that has intrigued the great philosophers--and has been hilariously lampooned by Monty Python. Indeed, the whole idea strikes many of us as vaguely pompous, a little absurd. Is there one profound and mysterious meaning to life, a single ultimate purpose behind human existence?  In What's It All About?, Julian Baggini says no, there is no single meaning. Instead, Baggini argues meaning can be found in a variety of ways, in this life. He succinctly breaks down six answers people commonly suggest when considering what life is all about--helping others, serving humanity, being happy, becoming successful, enjoying each day as if it were your last, and "freeing your mind." By reducing the vague, mysterious question of meaning to a series of more specific (if thoroughly unmysterious) questions about what gives life purpose and value, he shows that the quest for meaning can be personal, empowering, and uplifting. If the meaning of life is not a mystery, if leading meaningful lives is within the power of us all, then we can look around us and see the many ways in which life can have purpose. We can see the value of happiness while accepting it is not everything. We can see the value of success, without interpreting that too narrowly. We can see the value of seizing the day as well as helping others lead meaningful lives. We can recognize the value of love, as perhaps the most powerful motivator of all. Illustrating his argument with the thoughts of many of the great philosophers and examples drawn from everyday life, Baggini convincingly shows that the search for meaning is personal and within the power of each of us to find.	2005-10-01	Oxford University Press US						ZZZ000000
9780195342697	Fixing failed states,a framework for rebuilding a fractured world	Ashraf Ghani&Clare Lockhart		Today between forty and sixty nations, home to close to two billion people, have either collapsed or are teetering on the brink of failure. The world's worst problems--terrorism, drugs and human trafficking, absolute poverty, ethnic conflict, disease, genocide--originate in such states, and the international community has devoted billions of dollars to solving the problem. Yet by and large the effort has not succeeded. Ashraf Ghani and Clare Lockhart have taken an active part in the effort to save failed states for many years, serving as World Bank officials, as advisers to the UN, and as high-level participants in the new government of Afghanistan. Now, in Fixing Failed States, they describe the issue--vividly and convincingly--offering an on-the-ground picture of why past efforts have not worked and advancing a groundbreaking new solution to this most pressing of global crises. Military force, while certainly necessary on occasion, cannot solve the fundamental problems, and humanitarian interventions cost billions yet do not leave capable states in their wake. Ghani and Lockhart argue that only an integrated state-building approach can heal these failing countries. As they explain, many of these countries already have the resources they need, if only we knew how to connect them to global knowledge and put them to work in the right way. Their state-building strategy, which assigns responsibility equally among the international community, national leaders, and citizens, maps out a clear path to political and economic stability. The authors provide a clear, practical framework for achieving these ends, supporting their case with first-hand examples of struggling territories such as Afghanistan, Sudan, Kosovo and Nepal as well as the world's success stories--Singapore, Ireland, and even the American South. The battle against terror, poverty, climate change, and much more cannot be won unless we can save these nations. In Fixing Fixed States, two of the world's foremost authorities offer a way out of the current crisis--a framework for re-imagining the international system. It is a book that is unique in its essential optimism--an optimism that the authors have earned through their own substantial real-world efforts in failed states.	2008	Oxford University Press US						ZZZ000000

The book is beautifully enhanced by 22 color plates and 160 black and white illustrations with lucid explanatory captions, as well as maps, a glossary, a companion website, and an instructor's manual. Classical Mythology, Eighth Edition, has been updated and revised to reflect recent scholarship, featuring: * The most recent results of excavations at Troy and Orestes * Expanded discussions of Asclepius, Antigone, and Orestes * Many new text boxes including those on Homer, Hesiod, and the worship of Artemis at Brauron * A new chapter (25) on Ovid's treatment of classical mythology * Incorporation of local legends--for example, the myth of Bellerophon--in relevant myths and sagas (these legends, located in the former Chapter 25 in the previous edition, have now been distributed throughout the book where they best fit) * An improved art program, with new images, better-quality reproductions, and improved maps * Numbering of lines for all translations, for easy reference * Improved indexes and updated bibliographies * An improved and updated companion website, including images and maps * An instructor's manual and test bank (available for the first time)	2007	Oxford University Press						ZZZ000000
9780199219322	The Oxford handbook of international relations	Christian Reus-Smit&Duncan Snidal		The Oxford Handbook of International Relations offers the most authoritative and comprehensive overview to date of the field of International Relations. The Handbook debates the nature of the field itself, critically engages with the major theories, surveys a wide spectrum of methods, addresses the relationship between scholarship and policy making, and examines the field's relation with cognate disciplines. In so doing the Handbook gives readers authoritative and critical introductions to the subject and establish a sense of the field as a dynamic realm of argument and inquiry. The Handbook has two key and distinctive organizing principles. The first is its ground-breaking approach to the normative component in theorizing about International Relations. Earlier volumes have concentrated almost exclusively on theories as purely empirical or positive theories, with small sub-sections left for 'ethics and International Relations'. But all International Relations theories have both empirical and normative aspects; even methodological choices entail implicit normative commitments. Without this understanding, some of the arguments in International Relations are routinely miscast. The Oxford Handbook of International Relations offers a comprehensive survey of the field that deepens our understanding of how empirical and normative theorizing interact to constitute International Relations as a field of study. A second organizing principle is the analysis of how different perspectives have developed in relation to one another. Previous overviews of the field have treated contending theories and methods as isolated bodies of thought, or organized them into stylized 'great debates'. But these approaches obscure the dynamic interplay, conversation, and contestation between different perspectives. The Handbook examines this interplay, with chapter authors probing how their theory or approach has been affected by contestation with, and borrowing from, other approaches. In doing so it shows how diversity within International Relations has promoted, or perhaps sometimes stultified, progress in the field. The Oxford Handbook of International Relations advances a markedly different perspective on the field of International Relations and will be essential for reading for those interested in the advanced study of global politics and international affairs.	2008	Oxford University Press						ZZZ000000
9780199259779	The Oxford handbook of public management	Ewan Ferlie&Laurence E. Lynn&Christopher Pollitt		The public sector continues to play a strategic role across the world. The last thirty years have seen major shifts in approaches to public sector management in many different countries. There is also a fierce debate across academic disciplines about contemporary public administration/management: some advocate the use of more managerialist approaches; while others critique them. New functions have also arisen in the public sector, such as evaluation or management consulting, which require analysis. There is a renewed need for an analysis of contemporary public sector organizations, which are changing rapidly before our eyes. This it is time for an authoritative assessment of the major trends in public management, embracing both their intended and unintended effects. This handbook brings together leading international scholars to comment on key current issues. The individual chapters include a mix of broad overviews, in depth exploration of particular thematic areas and analyses of different theoretical perspectives such as political science, management, sociology, and economics. The authors have been given sufficient space to develop their distinctive arguments. The editors provide an overall concluding chapter. The Handbook combines scholarly rigor, engaging writing from senior authors and high policy relevance. It will be relevant to advanced students, researchers and reflective public sector practitioners.	2005	Oxford University Press						ZZZ000000

This analysis attempts to bring out how various sectors of the economy impinge on the development process. The authors show that two key features to the elimination of poverty in India are transferring labor from agriculture to industry and growth in agricultural productivity. They argue that industrial progress cannot benefit the poor in the absence of progress in the agricultural sector. They also show that by exporting industrial goods, the labor force employed in agriculture can be reduced and the poor in India would be made better off. Finally, they argue that India's industrial policy from Independence until very recently was designed to stifle entrepreneurship and undermine technical advancement.	1994-12-01	Oxford University Press						ZZZ000000

9780195623888	Samskara,a rite for a dead man	U. R. Anantha Murthy		Made into a powerful, award-winning film in 1970, this important Kannada novel of the sixties has received widespread acclaim from both critics and general readers since its first publication in 1965. As a religious novel about a decaying brahmin colony in the south Indian village of Karnataka, Samskara serves as an allegory rich in realistic detail, a contemporary reworking of ancient Hindu themes and myths, and a serious, poetic study of a religious man living in a community of priests gone to seed. A death which stands as the central event in the plot brings in its wake a plague, many more deaths, live questions with only dead answers, moral chaos, and the rebirth of one man. The volume provides a useful glossary of Hindu myths, customs, Indian names, flora, and other terms. Notes and an afterword enhance the self-contained, faithful, and yet readable translation.	1989	Oxford University Press						ZZZ000000

9780195692983	Multiculturalism, Liberalism and Democracy	Rajeev Bhargava&Amiya Kumar Bagchi&R Sudarshan		The last few decades have witnessed a shift towards a more balanced view in political theory and social science, one that acknowledges the cultural dimension of politics an the political dimension of culture. The essays in this volume reflect this shift by bringing together a number if interrelated themes of the multicultural perspective, such as the need for a stable identity; the link between identity, recognition and cultural community; the importance of belonging and cultural particularity. Significant questions are raised and discussed: What does it mean to recognize cultural communities? Does recognition entail subsidies from the state? Should every culture be publicly recognized? How can multiculturalism be prevented from being hierarchical and authoritarian? Can it be made liberal and democratic? Can the presence of different cultures within one political order be trouble free or will it always be conflict ridden?	2007-09-01	Oxford University Press, USA						ZZZ000000

Moulton		This is the first volume of the selected writings of Allan Octavian Hume, the founder of the Indian National Congress. It focuses on Hume's years in district administration in what was then the North Western Provinces. What lends special interest to this early phase of his life was that some eleven years of it were spent continuously in one district, Etawah. From these documents Hume emerges as a committed reformer in the British liberal utilitarian mode, but one who was very sensitive to local Indian opinion.	2005-01-27	Oxford University Press						ZZZ000000

Madan		This critical study offers a fresh appraisal of Hindu tradition as a rich and sensible philosophy of life, one based on plenitude, domesticity, transcendence, and control. Distinguished scholar T.N. Madan analyzes the ideas of Hinduism that dominate the literature of India, such as "renunciation," "purity," and "auspiciousness," and explains how modernity has changed conceptions of the good life, causing Hindus to search anew for their sense of self and social orientation.	1996	Oxford University Press						ZZZ000000

The symmetry of Dante, medicine of Paracelsus and science of Goethe form the background for this investigation of the modernist regime - its truth and method, pure and applied, its science of vivisection and technology of obsolescence. The leading hypothesis is that the self, the world and the other can have better relations in the future than they have had in the modern past from the new Eucharist to the bomb.	2002-05-23	Oxford University Press						ZZZ000000

9780195693362	The Triumph of Modernism,India's Artists and the Avant-Garde, 1922-1947	Partha Mitter		The tumultuous last decades of British colonialism in India were catalyzed by more than the work of Mahatma Gandhi and violent conflicts. The concurrent upheavals in Western art driven by the advent of modernism provided Indian artists in post-1920 India a powerful tool of colonial resistance. Distinguished art historian Partha Mitter now explores in this brilliantly illustrated study this lesser known facet of Indian art and history. Taking the 1922 Bauhaus exhibition in Calcutta as the debut of European modernism in India, "The Triumph of Modernism" probes the intricate interplay of Western modernism and Indian nationalism in the evolution of colonial-era Indian art. Mitter casts his gaze across a myriad of issues, including the emergence of a feminine voice in Indian art, the decline of "oriental art," and the rise of naturalism and modernism in the 1920s. Nationalist politics also played a large role, from the struggle of artists in reconciling Indian nationalism with imperial patronage of the arts to the relationship between primitivism and modernism in Indian art. An engagingly written study anchored by 150 lush reproductions, "The Triumph of Modernism" will be essential reading for scholars of art, British studies, and Indian history.	2007-11-01	Oxford University Press						ZZZ000000

9780198063810	The Illustrated Lives in the Wilderness,Three Classic Indian Autobiographies	Jim Corbett&Verrier Elwin&Salim Ali		Based on the autobiographical works of three men who shared a special relationship with India, and her flora and fauna--Jim Corbett, Verrier Elwin, and Sálim Ali--this is an adopted and illustrated edition of the classic Lives in the Wilderness. In My India, published when the author was 77, the legendary Jim Corbett writes with sympathy and concern of the people of the Indian foothills, their life, traditions, and folklore. The Tribal World of Verrier Elwin is the story of one of the greatest scholars and champions of India's tribal peoples. The hugely controversial Elwin's moving autobiography received the Sahitya Akademi award, which noted its 'sincerity, courage and charm, revealing a mind in which Western and Indian idealism were uniquely blended'. The Fall of a Sparrow is the autobiography of India's most celebrated ornithologist, Sálim Ali. From his 'first bird' at the age of ten, to birding expeditions in almost every area of the Subcontinent, Sálim Ali's account of his life and the changing world in which he lived is imbued with his characteristic charm and verve. With around 80 photographs and line drawings complementary the text, this volume will appeal to those interested in wildlife and conservation, anthropology, and social history of modern India, as well as anybody who enjoys good writing.	2010	Oxford University Press						ZZZ000000

9780192804617	Emotion,a very short introduction	Dylan Evans		Was love invented by European poets in the middle ages, as C. S. Lewis claimed, or is it part of human nature? Will winning the lottery really make you happy? Is it possible to build robots that have feelings? These are just some of the intriguing questions explored in this new guide to thelatest thinking about emotions. Drawing on a wide range of scientific research, from anthropology and psychology to neuroscience and artificial intelligence, Emotion: The Science of Sentiment takes the reader on a fascinating journey into the human heart. Illustrating his points with entertaining examples from fiction, film, and popular culture, Dylan Evans ranges from the evolution of emotions to the nature of love and happiness to the language of feelings, offering readers the most recent thinking on real life topics that touch us all.	2003-02-01	Oxford University Press						ZZZ000000

9780199544905	Txtng,the Gr8 Db8	David Crystal		Text messaging has spread like wildfire, especially among young people, who appear to spend most of their time texting, and are unwilling to write much else. Indeed the phenomena is so widespread that many parents, teachers, and media pundits have been outspoken in their criticism of it. Does texting spell the end of western civilization?In this humorous, level-headed and insightful book, David Crystal argues that the panic over texting is misplaced. Crystal, a world renowned linguist and prolific author on the uses and abuses of English, here looks at every aspect of the phenomenon of text-messaging and considers its effects on literacy, language, and society. He explains how texting began, how it works, who uses it, and how much it is used, and he shows how to interpret the mixture of pictograms, logograms, abbreviations, symbols, and wordplay typically used in texting. He looks at its manifestations in different languages, and explores the ways similar devices have been used in different eras. He finds that the texting system of conveying sounds and concepts goes back a long way--to the very origins of writing. And far from hindering children's literacy, texting turns out to help it.Illustrated with original art by Ed MacLachlan, the popular cartoonist whose work has appeared in Punch, Private Eye, New Statesman, and many other publications, Txting: The Gr8 Db8 is entertaining and instructive--reassuring for worried parents and teachers, illuminating for teenagers, and fascinating for everyone interested in what's currently happening to language and communication.David Crystal is honorary professor of linguistics at the University of Wales, Bangor. He has written or edited over 100 books and published numerous articles for scholarly, professional, and general readerships, in fields ranging from forensic linguistics and ELT to the liturgy and Shakespeare. His books include the Cambridge Encyclopedia of Language, the Cambridge Encyclopedia of the English Language, Words, Words, Words (OUP 2006), and The Fight for English (OUP 2006).	2008	Oxford University Press						ZZZ000000
