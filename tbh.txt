Only when the Mass Balance is performed, the Process Engineer can make calculations required for design of production equipment in the process. Energy balance involves the computation of input and outputs of energy in equipments. Energy Balance is performed from Material Balance taking into account the thermal effects (Exothermic or Endothermic) of reactions and the physical transformations (Evaporation, Crystallization) occurring in the Process Equipment.The present book has problems and solutions in Material and Energy Balance in Process Equipment. This is followed by Energy Balance problems. All problems assume Steady State system. The text covers the syllabus of all Chemical Engineering Schools offering this course.The number and variety of problems proposed in this book are extensive. The problems are organized in each chapter according to subject matter. It is possible for answers to differ slightly due to different sources of data.
