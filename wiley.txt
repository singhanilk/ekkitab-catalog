9788126510412	Visual Studio 2005 All-In-Desk Reference 7 Books In 1	Vanessa L. Williams		A thorough revision to the Visual Studio 2005 All-In-One Desk Reference For Dummies makes this the ideal book for new programmers or Java programmers looking to get up and running with Visual Studio. The book will be a comprehensive, value-priced reference for the entire Visual Studio 2005. Microsoft s catch-phrase for Visual Studio 2005 is personal productivity. The goal of personal productivity is to allow the developer to work at a higher level of abstraction. The goal of this book is to show the reader how to build applications using these productivity features of VS. As a result, language syntax and programming constructs are de-emphasized in favor of showing the user how to let VS generate the code.This book takes a layered approach similar to how most applications are architected. When developing a new application, developers often divide up the work for the user interface, service layer (data access), and domain classes (coding). Whether there is one developer playing all three roles, or three developers doing each, this approach allows the reader to easily reference the layer they are constructing.	2006	Wiley India Pvt.

9788126518623	Reminiscences Of A Stock Operator	Edwin Lefevre&Roger Lowenstein		Reminiscences of a Stock Operator is adapted from a series of Saturday Evening Post articles written by Edwin Lefevre in the 1920s. The book narrates Livermore s ascent from a boy plunger to the most influential speculator on Wall Street. While much of the book is devoted to Livermore s experiences, a larger part of the book deals with trading wisdom and rules that Livermore imparts through Lefevre. Years later, many trading and investing books repeat the very same rules first enunciated by Livermore in Reminiscences, such as: go with the trend; no stock is too high to buy or too low to sell; let your winners run and cut your losses short; make your own decisions; and market history repeats itself. Interestingly, Livermore frequently violated his own rules and usually lost money as a result. The enduring appeal to the book rests in Livermore s view that the market is made up of people and the excesses of the market reflect mass psychology and the mistakes of individuals are frequently the result of the inability to control fear and greed. Thus, the views and lessons of Livermore continue to be relevant to every new generation of investors and traders.	2008	Wiley India Pvt. Ltd.		English				BUS036000
