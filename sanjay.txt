9788189491970	Know your Green Leafy Vegetables	Tarla Dalal`	Paperback	Green leafy vegetables, also called greens, leafy greens or potherbs are a group of edible leaves that form a part of our daily diet. They are eaten as a vegetable, sometimes a accompanied by tender petioles and shoots. The leaves can range from tiny leaves bound in a bunch to broad leaves attached to the stem. In general, they include greens like spinach, amaranth, cabbage, fenugreek leaves, mustard leaves etc. There are also some lesser-known greens like mayalki bhaji, drumstick leaves and gonngura, which are used for very specific preparations.<br><br>The greens vary in taste. Some leaves are bland in taste while leaves like gongura have a peculiar, sour taste. Fenugreek leaves, for instance, impart a natural bitter taste. Thus, the flavour profile of green leafy vegetables is very broad. Some greens like spinach, cabbage, fenugreek, colocasia etc. are available throughout the year while others like bathua, khatta bhaji and sarson ka saag are available only in certain months. Depending on their size, flavour and colour, the right cooking methods should be used so that the green leaves retain their flavour, colour and most importantly the nutrients. They are commonly used in soups, salads, stews, raitas, chutneys, as well as in baked, stir-fried and deep  fried recipes.<br><br>Leafy vegetables are typically low in calories and fat, high in protein, dietary fibre, iron and calcium, and very high in phytochemicals such as vvitamin C, vitamin A, and folic acid. Thanks to the high water content, they are easily digestable. To tap the benefits of the nutrients contained in greens, make sure you eat at least 150 grams of greens daily.<br><br>No amount of capsules or tonic can ever be as effective as a regular intake of fresh green vegetables, in keeping your body and mind in ship-shape! That doesn t really mean a bowl of drab greens staring at you during lunchtime every day.You can turn these seemingly boring leafy veggies into extremely interesting and delicious dishes, which are packed not just with good health but irresistible flavour and aroma too!	2010	SANJAY	103	English				ZZZ000000
