9780230744080	Democracy Kills	Humphrey Hawksley		For many years Western governments have insisted that the only way to achieve long-term prosperity and political stability is through a combination of free-market economics and democratic government. Yet, all evidence now indicates that this argument is both flawed and can also be the direct cause of war, disease and poverty. From Pakistan to Zimbabwe, from the Palestinian territories to the former Yugoslavia, from Georgia to Haiti attempts to install democracy through elections have produced high levels of corruption and violence. Parliaments represent not broad constituencies but vested interests and, amid much fanfare, constitutions are written, but rarely upheld. Humphrey Hawksley has reported economic and political trends throughout the world for more than twenty years. In "Democracy Kills," he offers a vivid - and frequently devastating - analysis of our devotion to democracy. Taking the reader from Latin America, where he looks at collapse, then resurrection of the Argentine economy and China's growing influence in the region, to Africa, where he examines abusive child labour in the chocolate industry and to Asia he constantly asks why, if some nations can move on and get rich, do others founder and fight. And what - if anything - we can do about it.	2009-09-02	Macmillan						ZZZ000000

Over the coming days, Simon's lonely life will spiral out of control. With his pet goldfish Francine in tow, he embarks on a gripping existential investigation, into his own murky past, and that of Jeremy Shackleford, the (apparently) happily married math teacher whose body is now lying in Simon's bathtub under forty gallons of ice.

However, when mysterious messages appear on the walls around Simon's apartment, he realises that losing his old self will be more difficult than he'd imagined. Everything points to a long forgotten date the previous spring, when his life and Shackleford's first collided. As the contradictions mount, and the ice begins to melt, the events of the past year will resolve themselves in the most catastrophic way. Combining gritty noir, psychological drama and dazzling plotting, Low Lifeis a shocking novel that announces Jahn as a brilliant new voice of modern America.	2010-07-02	Pan Macmillan						FIC000000

9780230746121	The Philosopher Prince	Paul Waters		355AD. In a late-Roman world of ambitious bureaucrats and power-hungry courtiers two young friends of the British nobility, Drusus and Marcellus, have fallen foul of the prevailing authority. There is no place to hide, no turning back. They must face the irresistible might of the Roman state. It seems a fight they cannot win. For Drusus and Marcellus their only ally is the young imperial prince, Julian. But Julian has troubles of his own: his very success has made him hated by his uncle, the emperor. With spies and adversaries all about them, they link their fate with Julian's in a life-or-death struggle that takes them from one end of the empire to the other and set themselves against the forces determined to crush them. A novel of hope, "The Philosopher Prince "is a story of human values pitted against the cold and calculating machine of an all-powerful tyranny. And at its heart, a victim of the very forces he controls, lies the emperor himself.	2010	Pan Macmillan						ZZZ000000
9780230711303	The Spire	Richard North Patterson		The new blockbuster from the thinking man's thriller writer A young college president struggles to save his once-prestigious alma mater, Caldwell College, from a financial scandal which may be linked to the murder of a student, some 17 years previously. The Caldwell campus is dominated by a large bell tower known as The Spire. The Spire ornaments the school yearbook, stationery, all publications. Steeped in lore, it tolls every hour of the school day; or to mark notable events such as athletic triumphs. But in 1993, the body of Angela Hall, a black student, was found at the foot of the Spire. Raped and murdered, she seemed oddly like a sacrifice to the newly-ominous college landmark... Gripping and razor-sharp, The Spire is both a hugely satisfying thriller and a poignant love story. Richard North Patterson has outdone himself - this is his most compelling novel in years.	2009-10	PAN MACMILLAN						ZZZ000000

9780330455794	Edinburgh,A History of the City	Michael Fry		The late poet laureate, Sir John Betjeman, said that Edinburgh was the most beautiful city in Europe. Like some other great cities it is set on seven hills. But only one of these, Rome, rivals Edinburgh in matching the beauty of its setting with the stateliness of its buildings. Edinbrugh, too, provides the backdrop to much of the dark drama of the Scottish past, from Mary Queen of Scots to Bonnie Prince Charlie and beyond. Michael Fry, who has lived and worked there for nearly forty years, provides a compellingly readable account of this great city, from the earliest times to the present, balancing Edinburgh's cultural, political and social history, and painting a vivid portrait of a city - that like Stevenson's Dr Jekyll - is both dark and light, both dark and light, both 'Auld Reekie' and 'Athens of the North'. 'Impressive ... in the style of Peter Ackroyd's history of London' Magnus Linklator, "Spectator " "'"No one interested in the history of Edinburgh, and indeed Scotland, should be without it' Allan Massie, "Scotsman"	2010-07-02	Pan Macmillan						HIS015000

9780330510936	All the Pretty Horses	Cormac McCarthy		"Volume One of the Border Trilogy"  'A uniquely brilliant book . . . told in language as subtly beautiful as its desert setting. One of the most important pieces of American writing of our time' Stephen Amidon, "Sunday Times"  John Grady Cole is the last bewildered survivor of long generations of Texas ranchers. Finding himself cut off from the only life he has ever wanted, he sets out for Mexico with his friend Lacey Rawlins. Befriending a third boy on the way, they find a country beyond their imagining: barren and beautiful, rugged yet cruelly civilized; a place where dreams are paid for in blood.  "All the Pretty Horses" is an acknowledged masterpiece and a grand love story: a novel about childhood passing, along with innocence and a vanished American age. Steeped in the wisdom that comes only from loss, it is a magnificent parable of responsibility, revenge and survival.  'A darkly shining work . . . executed with consummate skill and much subtlety - the effect is magnificent' John Banville, "Observer"  'An exhilarating, exceptional novel' "Spectator"  'In a single stride it takes McCarthy to the forefront of contemporary American fiction. "All the Pretty Horses "is indisputably a masterpiece' "Financial Times"	2010	Pan Macmillan						ZZZ000000

Thompson has reported the election story in his truly inimitable, just-short-of-libel style. In Better than Sex, Thompson hits the dusty trail again without leaving home yet manages to deliver a mind-bending view of the 1992 presidential campaign, in all of its horror, sacrifice, lust, and dubious glory. Complete with faxes sent to and received by candidate Clinton's top aides, and 100 per cent pure gonzo screeds on Richard Nixon, George Bush, and Oliver North, here is the most true-blue campaign tell-all ever penned by man or beast. '[Thompson] delivers yet another of his trademark cocktail mixes of unbelievable tales and dark observations . . .

9780330510943	Blood Meridian	Cormac McCarthy		"Blood Meridian" is an epic novel of the violence and depravity that attended America's westward expansion, brilliantly subverting the conventions of the Western novel and the mythology of the Wild West. Based on historical events that took place on the Texas-Mexico border in the 1850s, it traces the fortunes of the Kid, a fourteen-year-old Tennesseean who stumbles into a nightmarish world where Indians are being murdered and the market for their scalps is thriving.  'McCarthy's achievement is to establish a new mythology which is as potent and vivid as that of the movies, yet one which has absolutely the opposite effect . . . He is a great writer' "Independent"  'I have rarely encountered anything as powerful, as unsettling, or as memorable as "Blood Meridian" . . . A nightmare odyssey' "Evening Standard"  'His masterpiece . . .The book reads like a conflation of the "Inferno," "The Iliad "and "Moby Dick." I can only declare that Blood Meridian is unlike anything I have read in recent years, and seems to me an extraordinary, breathtaking achievement' John Banville	2010	Picador						ZZZ000000

I am comfortable with these themes.'Hunter S. Thompson, celebrated author of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, has been writing a weekly column for the San Francisco Examinerfor the last two years. Those columns are collected here to offer a chronicle of the adventures of a Generation of Swine.The incomparable 'Dr Gonzo' has journeyed no small distance in search of intelligent life and reports back, instead, on the demented state of current events. He keeps tabs on the 1998 presidential race, quotes from the Bible (reference books in hotel rooms are supplied exclusively by the Gideons) and asks why the President appears to be a hundred and twenty-eight years old.'He is working from a dementia that no one in his right mind would want to share. It is the dementia, however, that makes Thompson great' Playboy'His hallucinated vision strikes one as having been, after all, the sanest' Nelson Algren	2010	Pan Macmillan						ZZZ000000
9780330442497	Origins	Amin Maalouf		'We are, and always will be, wanderers who have lost their way . . .'  When a trunk of family letters gives Amin Maalouf the opportunity to trace his past, he finds himself - having never before asked questions - transfixed by the stories of his ancestors. Starting in the mountains of Lebanon and taking him across the sea to Havana, his history is one of restlessness and exile: of the search for identity, of dramatic emigrations, and of revolutions espoused in the dying years of the Ottoman Empire and beyond. The result is an exquisite memoir, a book that finds drama in the most personal of tales, pathos in the grandest of gestures, and an understanding that the most nomadic of families can also epitomize home.  'Origins is many things: an introduction to Lebanon's complex history, the end of Ottoman Empire through Arab eyes, and an intimate account of diasporic identity. Exquisitely tempered' "Independent"  'Maalouf's far-seeing and hospitable worldview is presided over, like that of his grandfather, by "the angel of reason," and in Origins he tells a story he has painstakingly salvaged just in time' "Daily Telegraph"  'Maalouf has a novelist's ear for language and an historian's eye for detail: they have combined to create a masterpiece which can only help to further understanding of our complicated times' "Tablet"	2009-09-04	Picador						ZZZ000000
9780330511223	Outer Dark	Cormac McCarthy		By the author of the critically acclaimed Border Trilogy, "Outer Dark" is a novel at once mythic and starkly evocative, set in an unspecified place in Appalachia sometime around the turn of the century. A woman bears her brother's child, a boy; the brother leaves the baby in the woods and tells her he died of natural causes. Discovering her brother's lie, she sets forth alone to find her son. Both brother and sister wander separately through a countryside being scourged by three terrifying and elusive strangers, headlong toward an eerie, apocalyptic resolution.  'McCarthy is a master stylist, perhaps without equal in American letters . . . In his hands, everything is done with consummate skill' "Village Voice "  'McCarthy has made the fabulous real, the ordinary mysterious' "New York Times "  'A profound parable that ultimately speaks to any society in any time' "Time"	2010-03-01	Picador USA						ZZZ000000
9780330490733	Terra; Tales of the Earth,Four Events That Changed the World	Richard Hamblyn		Blending history, science and eye-witness accounts, and arranged in chapters corresponding to the four elements (earth, air, fire and water), Terra explores the relationship between the planet and the humans who inhabit its surfaces. Through four case histories - the Lisbon earthquake of 1755; the weather-panics of the summer of 1783; the eruption of Krakatau in 1883; and the Hilo tsunami of 1946 - Hamblyn reminds us of the earth's unimaginable force and describes what happens when that force is unleashed, both in terms of the immediate human consequences and the longer term economic and scientific implications. Serving, ultimately, as a stark and incontrovertible reminder of our vulnerability when the earth 'goes wrong', Terra also asks why we don't seem fully able to learn from the catastrophes, mistakes and responses of the past. Praise for Richard Hamblyn's previous book, The Invention of Clouds: 'An elegantly written and richly diverting thesis of unusual interdisciplinary facility' Guardian 'A book that accomplishes that rare feat of changing the reader's perception of the world' Economist	2009-09-04	Picador						ZZZ000000
9780330462686	In a free state,the novel	Vidiadhar Surajprasad Naipaul		'"In a Free State" was conceived in 1969 as a sequence about displacement. There was to be a central novel, set in Africa, with shorter surrounding matter from other places. The shorter pieces from these varied places were intended to throw a universal light on the African material.  But then, as the years passed and the world changed, and I felt myself less of an oddity as a writer, I grew to feel that the central novel was muffled and diminished by the surrounding material and I began to think that the novel should be published on its own. This is what, thirty-seven years after its first publication, my publisher is doing in this edition.' V.S. Naipaul  "In a Free State" is set in Africa, in a place like Uganda or Rwanda, and its two main characters are English. They had once found liberation in Africa. But now Africa is going sour on them. The land is no longer safe, and at a time of tribal conflict they have to make a long drive to the safety of their compound. At the end of this drive - the narrative tight, wonderfully constructed, the formal and precise language always instilled with violence and rage - we know everything about the English characters, the African country, and the Idi Amin-like future awaiting it.  This is one of V.S. Naipaul's greatest novels, hard but full of pity. It won the Booker Prize, in its original edition, in 1971.	2008-09-05	Picador						ZZZ000000
9780330510769	Screwjack	Hunter S. Thompson		Including a chronicle of his first mescaline experience, a trailer-park confrontation and ending with an unnaturally poignant love story, Screwjackis an exhilarating collection of short stories. As Thompson puts it in his introduction, the three stories here 'build like Bolero to a faster & wilder climax that will drag the reader relentlessly up a hill, & then drop him off a cliff . . . That is the Desired Effect.' Amid all the hilarity, Hunter S. Thompson proves just how brilliant a prose stylist he really is. Screwjackis salacious, unsettling, and brutally lyrical. 'Hunter Thompson elicits the same kind of admiration one would feel for a streaker at Queen Victoria's funeral' William F Buckley 'There are only two adjectives writers care about anymore, brilliantand outrageous, and Hunter S. Thompson has a freehold on both of them' Tom Wolfe	2010	Pan Macmillan						ZZZ000000

If you don't know the answer to that, then 1) you should and 2) you haven't been reading Neal Asher (see point 1)' Jon Courtenay Grimwood In the eight years since his first full-length novel Gridlinked was published by Pan Macmillan, Neal Asher has firmly established himself as one of the leading British writers of Science Fiction, and his novels are now translated in many languages. Most of his stories are set in a galactic future-scape called 'The Polity', and with this collection of marvellously inventive and action-packed short stories, he takes us further into the manifold diversities of that amazing universe. No one does monsters better than Neal Asher, so be prepared to revisit the lives and lifestyles of such favourites as the gabbleduck and the hooder, to savour alien poisons, the walking dead, the Sea of Death, and the putrefactor symbiont.	2009-11-13	Macmillan Publishers Ltd						ZZZ000000

It tells of John Wesley Rattner, a young boy, and Marion Sylder, an outlaw and bootlegger who, unbeknownst to either of them, has killed the boy's father.

The answer is - of course - football.Foer presents an unexpected, uniquely revealing tour of the politics and culture of football from Milan to Tehran. He examines the game_s role in sustaining ancient hatreds and rivalries (Serbia_s Red Star and Croatia_s Dinamo); in supporting the migration of players and the rise of the football oligarchs (such as Silvio Berlusconi, President of AC Milan _ and of Italy); and in defending the virtues and vices of old-fashioned nationalism. As Foer brilliantly illuminates, the Balkan War, anti-Semitism, Jewish identity, racism, social integration, media manipulation, and American patriotism have all been influenced by, as well as have had a dramatic effect on, football.On his travels, Foer encounters a collection of fans that is stranger than fiction: from a British hooligan with a Jewish mother, a Nazi father and a career as a soldier of fortune, to a fan club in Serbia that turns into a brutal anti-Muslim paramilitary unit. The result is an unforgettable parade of uniquely memorable fans _ each set into his _ or her _ unique political and cultural context.	2006-03-02	Arrow						ZZZ000000

In revenge for her own gang rape, her followers killed 20 high-caste Indians, which led to her surrender and imprisonment.

Based on the diaries that documented their extraordinary friendship, Moxham offers a fascinating portrait of a remarkable woman and reveals the hidden face of India.	2010-06-15	Ebury Publishing						SOC026000
9781847921253	American Caesars	Nigel Hamilton		Suetonius' The Twelve Caesars became a classic of classical times: a virtuoso literary imperial portrait gallery by an already distinguished author, not only remarkable for its frank dissections (in contrast to contemporary commemorations) of Rome's great emperors, but also because the twelve men whom he chose were the embodiment - both good and bad - of Rome's greatest century. The twentieth century has been called 'the American century', given its economic and military rise to superpower status in World War II, as well as its seemingly irresistible influence over global popular culture , politics and language ever since. The time is ripe for a new work on the U.S. presidents of our own lifetime: from FDR to George W. Bush. In what will become an essential book for our times, eminent biographer Nigel Hamilton offers an informative but intensely readable gallery of historical portraits that will encapsulate the age of American empire through the lives of its chief executives and the women they loved.	2010-09-01	Random House						ZZZ000000

9780099524038	The Case for God,What Religion Really Means	Karen Armstrong		Now available in paperback The enormous popularity of books by Richard Dawkins, Christopher Hitchens, Sam Harris and others shows that despite the religious revival that is under way in many parts of the world, there is widespread confusion about the nature of religious truth. For the first time in history, a significantly large number of people want nothing to do with God. In the past people went to great lengths to experience a sacred reality that they called God, Brahman, Nirvana or Dao; indeed religion could be said to be the distinguishing characteristic of homo sapiens. But now militant atheists preach a gospel of godlessness with the zeal of Christian missionaries in the age of faith and find an eager audience. What has happened? * Karen Armstrong argues that historically atheism has rarely been a denial of the sacred itself but has nearly always rejected a particular conception of God.

9780753519868	Reach for the Skies,Ballooning, Birdmen and Blasting Into Space	Richard Branson		As far back as stories go, pioneers have reached for the skies. In the last two hundred years, they have mastered the air and made the modern world possible. Today they are bringing outer space within our reach. They're inventors and toymakers, amateurs and adventurers, visionaries, dreamers and, yes, crackpots. Some have called them irresponsible, even dangerous. But I have met many of them. I have worked with them, and funded them, and flown with them. I admire them, and trust them, and I think they and their kind are our future. In this book I look at the history of flight through the stories and people who have inspired me throughout my life. In these pages you will find tales of miraculous rescues; of records made and broken; of surprising feats of endurance and survival, including some of my own adventures, as well as developments in the future of air (and space) travel. It is a story of pioneers, and of course it includes the world famous Montgolfiers and the Wright brothers. But I also want to describe some of the lesser-known trailblazers -- people like Tony Jannus, who in 1914 created the world's first scheduled commercial flight, flying his passengers over the waters of Tampa Bay at an altitude of just fifty feet; the bird man Leo Valentin, who in the 1950s jumped from 9,000 feet with wooden wings attached to his shoulders; and my friend, Steve Fossett, who dedicated his life to breaking records and having adventures.

His characters remain suspended between two continents, two cultures, two different lives. All too often, migration to the West results in the realisation that one's existence in another culture is compromised in many ways, that one was much happier back home.

As Union Minister of Defence, External Affairs and Finance in the BJP-led NDA Government in India, Jaswant Singh held many keys to this radical transformation in India's foreign policy, defence policies and economic planning. He handled several critical issues that confronted the country. India's legitimate security needs found international recognition, post-1998. The consequent challenges to Indian statecraft are analysed in great detail in chapters on USA, China, and Pakistan.

He was a major player in the release of 166 passengers aboard IC814 hijacked to Kandahar and provides a first-hand account of that testing episode.

9788129110824	A journey out of India	Anna K. Chacko		A JOURNEY OUT OF INDIA is a touching memoir, which describes the author s life experiencing the joys and vicissitudes of growing up in a world of affuence followed by a period of privation. The book touches upon many issues relevant in today s world: childhood, family, identity, sexual awakening, women, culture, and religious differences. Using events, memories, and pain and discovery as multiple colours on her layered palette, the author creates a sensual, impressionistic account of her life as a young woman. The wistfully nostalgic flavour is captured through the eyes of the child raised by a Dalit servant, Lakshmi, who inspires her to pursue her dreams. The surrounding cast of characters includes an imperious grandmother, a resolute mother, a gentle and ineffectual father, and a wealthy and exotic aunt. The central figure is moulded by a smorgasbord of experiences through sexual awakening at the hands of a paternal uncle, disease and death in one of the busiest hospitals in India while studying to become a doctor, and the customary but disastrous traditionally arranged marriage. When her life s dream of immigrating to the United States is finally realized, she finds that this is a Pyrrhic victory- in the process she has lost her father. The author s story is an elaborate choreography of life weaving a rich tapestry, culminating in the final product a complex woman who has learned humour and compassion, tolerance and fortitude, empathy and wisdom through suffering, sorrow and mostly laughter.	2007	Rupa & Co.

9788129108272	Aripan and other stories	Stephen Alter		Interwoven through the themes of love and loss, these stories heighten a sense of nostalgia for the past, for home, for people and places never seen again.

These are contemporary stories; dealing with an age where the personal and the political have never been closer, where urban relationships are continually reinvented, where family bonds become more vital even in their diminishing importance. They are also funny stories; of friendships and the quirks of love, even a dismembered ghost and the power of small-town gossip. With delicate strokes and the intricate interweaving of an aripan, Aripan and Other Stories paints a picture of a world that will delight you and move you.	2005	Rupa & Co.						ZZZ000000

9788129103833	Babudom,catacombs of Indian bureaucracy	Sudhansu Mohanty		Sudhansu Mohanty explores with remarkable candour the psyche and acts of Indian bureaucracy beneath the surface quiet. Today, morality is alien, even the very mention of it. What does the society feel about it? The babu inheres this - plucking it from the atmosphere as it were, and quickly learns the art while still in bureaucratic diapers. The looming larger-than-life boss helps him to perfect the craft. Thus the metamorphosis begins. Few more years and some stints in the national capital complete this process of transmogrification. The outcome: a kleptocrat, not a bureaucrat; service to self, not to the nation and people - that is the leit motif. This is the story of the Indian klepto babu. With the benefit of a closed yet detached (ringside!) view of this kleptocracy past and present, and garnished with subtle wit and humour, Mohanty bares the underbelly of Indian bureaucracy, nay kleptocracy. Yet not everything is beyond human redemption. Mohanty offers complete transparency, right to information and whistleblowing as the solvents to bureaucratic ills. Laced with shafted epigrams and barbed innuendoes, this is the first book to string together upfront the day-to-day shenanigans in the innards of the Indian bureaucracy.	2005-02-02	Rupa & Co.

9788129107053	Book Of My Mother	Albert Cohen		This is a moving memorial to his mother's life by Albert Cohen, the internationally renowned author of Belle du Seigneur. Cohen left France for London to escape the Nazis in 1940. In 1943 he received news of his mother's death in Marseilles. Unable to mourn her, he expressed his grief in a series of articles for La France Libre and revised them in 1954 for publication as Le Livre de ma Mere (Book of my Mother). Since then the book has been translated into eleven languages. Cohen intended it as a tribute to all mothers: 'I shall not have written in vain if one of you, after reading my song of death, is one evening gentler with his mother because of me and my mother.'

9788129109248	BUSINESS ETHICS	Rajiv K Mishra		Business Ethics: Code of Conduct for Managers deals with the flipside of management, a side which is seen as incongruent to management and business - ethics. In this book, the author discusses ways of bringing back ethical standards in the corporate world by drawing from the wisdom of Indian thinkers like Vivekananda and Sri Aurobindo, and texts such as the Bhagwad Gita. He also discusses a direct action oriented model code of conduct for managers which will resolve any dilemmas that modern-day managers might face in conducting business deals. The book illustrates the consequences of ignoring ethical values in business using true stories from around the world, as well as the success stories of companies which conducted their business ethically. Success, as the book demonstrates, cannot be achieved at the cost of moral and ethical values.		Rupa & Co.						ZZZ000000

9788129111876	Chitrangada & Other Dramatic Poems	Rabindranath Tagore		The years between 1892 and 1900 comprised the most prolific phase of Rabindranath Tagore s literary career; it was during this period that he wrote several dramatic poems, natyakabya. Less well-known than his novels and poetry, his dramatic poems are, nevertheless, masterpieces. Included in this collection are Chitrangada, Viday Abhishap, Gandharir Avedan and Karna-Kunti Samvad all based on well-known incidents from the Mahabharata. Through his technical mastery, erudite vision, and poetic style, Tagore explores the depth of human character. His innovative and imaginative pen exploits the metrical technique of the payar and the rhymed enjambment to address the perennial questions plaguing mankind: what is beauty, love, human relationships? Chitrangada (1891): Here, Tagore expresses his own views on transient beauty and eternal truth, in his own unique and poetic style. Because of its delicate psychological construction, tenderness and grandeur of passion, rich sensuousness, evocative image and metaphors, it is acclaimed as one of the finest lyric dramas ever produced. Viday Abhishap (1893), Gandharir Avedan (1897) and Karna-Kunti Samvad (1900) reveal Tagore s vision of dharma , which is the pivot around which these three poems revolve. Translated from the Bengali by Shailesh Parekh, these dramatic poems retain the melody, mood, meaning, and essence of the original. Through his ingenuity, the translator has succeeded in maintaining the depth, dramatic power, and dynamic equivalence in these poems.	2007	Rupa & Co.						ZZZ000000
9788129112125	Choose Your Destiny : A Teenager'S Guide To Personality Development	Rajiv K. Mishra		Teenagers are grown-up individuals aspiring to have his or her own social identity. Its an age when they have tremendous measure of enthusiasm, plenty of energy, big dreams and unconventional ideas to win the whole world, but it is also true that they are mesmerized and confused too. On the whole they find plenty of glittering and promising options but very little guidance to achieve those goals. At a time when conventional wisdom is challenged very often and traditional values are no more relevant, they seek guidance and counseling from experienced professionals. This book is an effort in that direction. Lateral thinking, seven hat method of constructive dialogue, choosing the right path, creative thinking and daring to choose unconventional and less adventured career are some of the major subjects dwelled upon in the book. The author has tried to evolve steps to help young readers achieve better personality traits.		Rupa & Co.						ZZZ000000
9788129105769	Circle And Other Stories-Pb	Intizar Husain		The stories in this collection are drawn from the rich oral narrative tradition of the Indian subcontinent, on sources as diverse as the Katha Sagar, Puranic lore, Sufi legends, Jataka tales, Kissa-kahani and dastan, as well as Intizar Hussain's own training and experience as a veteran newspaper man. In story after story he seeks to retrieve the past, to see it better, to understand it, maybe even learn from it. Taken together, they cover a gamut of emotions - nostalgia for a world left behind in India, angst for the amputated 'other' abandoned in the former East Pakistan, concern over the two emerging nuclear powers, a cathartic repurging of his own Shia Muslim legacy and much more.

Clive Bell (1881-1964), an English art critic, was best known for promoting his theory of formalism. He was a philosopher who defended abstract art and was a member of the Bloomsbury School.	2002	Rupa & Co.						ZZZ000000

9788129108784	Clueless & co	Pratik Basu		Clueless & Co. is a light-hearted, whimsical, tongue-in-cheek, bitingly irreverent and thoroughly exaggerated romp through corporate Calcutta, in the early '80s. It is narrated from the perspective of two comparative greenhorns: Rahul Banerjee, who, on a sudden impulse, resigns a stable, albeit predictable, job with a multinational company to start a market research agency of his own in partnership with two relative (and, as subsequent events reveal, rather weird) strangers; and the other, an unnamed 'I', who, as a junior executive in another multinational firm, finds himself constantly blundering into situations that his business school education had not prepared him for. While a series of bizarre experiences stretch their talent and fortitude to breaking point and force them to unlearn all the tenets of management that they'd imbibed in business school, they manage to muddle through in the end by adhering to a simple life-lesson: not to take oneself too seriously. Clueless & Co. is an invitation to join them in a rib-tickling, rip-roaring, rollercoaster ride through a wacky world of mortifying misadventures and commercial calamities.	2006-04-01	Rupa & Co.

9788129105943	Dancing in the family,an unconventional memoir of three women	Sukanya Rahman		As a child, Sukanya Rahman secretly prayed that her family would 'become normal'. This never happened. Dance was, and remained, the family obsession. Eventually, Sukanya too was swept up by the excitement of her mother's and grandmother's daily domestic life -- where 'home' could shift from a comfortable apartment in New Delhi, to a snake-infested room in an Orissan village, and the only stable figure in a long line of foot-tapping gurus, tabla players and dancers, was Ayah with her tin trunk -- to leap into her ancestral footsteps, thankful that her prayers had remained unanswered. Dancing in the Family is the story of how Sukanya's grandmother, born Esther Sherman, in Petoskey, Michigan, transformed herself into Ragini Devi, classical Indian dancer, pioneer and writer of the first book in English on the dances of India. It is the story of her mother's struggle to shake off the 'stigma' of becoming India's first Miss India in order to prove herself, as Indrani Rahman, as one of India's foremost classical Bharata Natyam and Odissi Artistes. It is also the story of Sukanya's own struggle to stay afloat in this family of dynamic, indomitable women. Written with rare honesty and humour about matters close to the heart, this is an insightful and fascinating look into the Indian dance scene from the 1920s on. More than 50 archival family photographs, dating from 1893, contribute to making the book a gem in the history of Indian dance.	2004-02-02	Rupa & Co.						ZZZ000000

This compilation is a remarkable effort to both coalesce and scatter, the kaleidoscopic expressions of human life.

In a narrative style that breaks all prescribed boundaries, themes ranging from modernization, poverty, communalism, sexuality, madness, terrorism, and disability, have been examined through various dramatic situations and circumstances. The twist in the tale at the end of each story gives them all a precarious edge.	2007	Rupa & Co.						ZZZ000000

The likeness between Bolaris and Ratzel was so remarkable that Bolaris was left in no doubt that they were related brothers, or perhaps even twins. As sworn enemies, and now as his captor, Bolaris had to work out a way to discover the truth of Ratzel s identity and do so without sacrificing his loyalty. The Croquet Player: Georgie was a very sensitive man; what some would, and did call a sissy. Of course Georgie would never dream of blaming his somewhat effeminate nature on the over possessive and overbearing aunt who brought him up although others weren t quite so reticent with their opinions. Georgie had one reason at least to thank his aunt she had led him into the career he so shone at. It didn t matter to George that playing croquet wasn t exactly the most glamorous thing he could do, because it was on the croquet lawn that he met some of the most intriguing people . . .

If the hands on the sundial could be altered to speed on to the next day, or to revert to our yesterdays? Wouldn t this have immeasurable implication on every aspect of our lives? And if time becomes transient, the concept of our lives? And if time becomes transient, the concept of the death must surely take on a very different flavour.

Arvind Sharma		This book examines the widespread perception that Hindu religion is largely inegalitarian, and demonstrates that such a conclusion is only supported by a part of the evidence, and not by the entire range of evidentiary material which can be brought to bear on the point.

Fraser s main interest to venture on this journey was to add substance to the general stock of geographical knowledge more so because any information respecting a tract of country so very little known, promised to be somewhat interesting if not perfect conveyed. Fraser and his party enjoyed a perfect and unrestrained freedom, together with full access to every place and person, private and public, as conquerors and as benefactors. He also enjoyed the means of procuring a tolerably accurate survey of the country, and of amassing materials for maps. Fraser having decided to publish his observation was keen to relate with simplicity what he had seen and heard, and noted down facts that describe the physical characteristics of the terrain with as much skill as required. According to Fraser, if his efforts succeed in satisfying or in awakening curiosity and in inducing those who are better qualified than him, to explore the terrain of which he has barely gazed from a distance then he feels his mission is fulfilled.	2008	Rupa & Co.

Predictably however, the world did not take too kindly to India s nuclear ambitions and all technical and monetary assistance that it had been receiving from other nuclear states, ceased abruptly. Not only that, these powerful nations placed various sanctions on the country, severely incapacitating its ambitious dreams of entering the coveted nuclear club. All further work on the country s nuclear arsenal and power plants was therefore delayed. But these may now be things of the past, especially if the Indo-US nuclear deal comes through. This interesting history of India s bombastic entry into the Power Club also includes balanced arguments on the controversial Hyde Act.	2008	Rupa & Co.						ZZZ000000

Titled as it is, the book deals with the little known, but much scandalised, private life of the Mughals who ruled from 1526, practically to 1803 when the British captured Delhi and Agra, their nerve-centres, from them. This included the period of the reign of three great Mughals, viz. Akbar (1556-1605), Jehangir (1605-27) and Shah Jahan (1628-58), of little more than a century. They possessed not only fabulous wealth, but also the vision to found a culture-State, in the real sense of the term. Planting it in the soil as naturally as a banyan tree, they institutionalized their life, as much as their government. The former, almost completely shrouded in mystery, offers one of the most interesting aspects of medieval Indian history and culture.	2005	Rupa & Co.						ZZZ000000

Crisis in Civilisation (Sabhyatar Samkat) was the last public address delivered by Tagore on April 14,1941.The essays incorporatedfrom The Religion of Man (1941) are an extensive and commandingexposition of Tagore's understanding of the meaning and significance of religion in the cultural history of man.

9788129109231	Rabindranath Tagore : Achalayatan	Rabindranath Tagore		Rabindranath Tagore's Achalayatan (1912) presents an arena of conflicting faiths. Built on a story of resistance to the naturalness of life, Mahapanchak's 'Achalayatan', representing a quest of dry wisdom, turns into a petrified land of illusion and immobility. On the other hand, the Sonpangshus are work addicts to the extent that they mistake work for the end and not the means, while the Darvaks remain happy with their simple, unquestioning, selfless devotion. All three fail to realise that life is to be tasted in its totality. Knowledge, power to work, and devotion are to be assimilated to achieve the true version of life. And for that, the Guru's help becomes imperative. In essence the play is a strong indictment of our ethico-religious and educational systems drained of all meaning and rendered bloodless, dry and sterile through over-emphasising rules for rules' sake.	2006	Rupa & Co.

9788129109026	Rajkahini	Abanindranath Tagore Translated By Monimala Dhar		The Rajput hero has always held a special place in India's cultural landscape. Legend, myth, history and literary imagination combined to present the Rajput as the ultimate embodiment of heroism, honour and chivalry, capable of inspiring the most profound sacrifices among his dependants and clan. History is his source, and imagination and language are his tools to infuse characters with vitality. Each of the stories in Abanindranath Tagore's Rajkahini, dealing with the lives and events of a dynasty of warriors of ancient Mewar of erstwhile Rajputana, is superbly singular. Yet they have a common vein running through them - gripping accounts of Rajput courage and valour. Abanindranath Tagore's lyrical style of narration weaving oral tales and history, has helped characters like Shiladitya, Goha, Bappaditya, Padmini, Chanda and others live a life beyond the pages of history books.

Written at a time when the values that informed theatrical work in Kerala revolved round a certain kind of polarity, namely the realist vs the indigenous, Sauparnika broke new ground by its attempt to achieve a difficult balance between the two opposite worlds. While it has all the surface trappings of an indigenous theatrical production, it seeks to address important questions that are quite contemporary in character---individual romantic love, the family, and the caste system.

9788129109378	Sesher kobita	Rabindranath Tagore		In Sesher Kbaita, Rabindranath Tagore knocks away social and familial props just to set a young man and a woman talking to one another. Tagore maps the emotional evolution through a series of scintillating conversations between the two protagonists - Amit Rai and Labanyalata. Seshar Kabita has many layers; it is an unusual love story on the surface, but the deeper one moves into the story, one realizes that Tagore is subtly slipping in other elements as well. Is love important in marriage? Does marriage leave space, physical abnd mental, for both the partners? And then there is Tagore's awareness of the Bengali language itself, with which he plays elaborate language games. The startingly contemporaneous engagement with issues of romantic love and the responsibilities and everydayness of marriage is gripping: there may be nods of agreement, or spectical headshakes, but to avoid reflection on the questions Tagore raises, is impossible.	2006-06-06	Rupa						ZZZ000000

9788129116437	Shree Ramayana Mahanveshanam (A Set Of Two Volumes)	M.

The stories from the Ramanyana have been passed on from one generation to another; the values attached to it are very intricately connected to our culture. About the Author: Dr M. Veerappa Moily's Shree Ramayana Mahanveshanam is a highly laudable work which, though rooted in the contemporary Indian context, addresses universal concerns and presents a unique vision of past, present and future all clubbed into one. The title literally signifying quest and examination, the book rightly explores the Ramatattwa or the true principles of the Rama-story, from a secularist modernist perspective. Moily has introduced several new characters and incidents in the epic, at the same time, taking great care of retaining the original essence of Valmiki's Ramayana. Moily re-interprets many familiar incidents from the point of view of modern sensibility. He has drawn freely from Jaina and folk traditions.	2010	Rupa & Co.						ZZZ000000

For the lay listener, it outlines the various movements and nuances through which a classical raga is developed, in both its vocal and instrumental genres, and the various gharanas or traditions of style that have emerged as a consequence of the guru-shishya method of learning this art.	2006	Rupa & Co.

A part of the grand epic the Mahabharata, the Bhagavad Gita is a conversation between the great Pandava hero Arjuna and Krishna the lord Vishnu incarnate. As Arjuna stands on the battlefield of Kurukshetra, readying to fight an army comprising his relatives, even his own guru, he is overcome with despair. He turns to his friend Krishna for advice and the ensuing conversation between the two is the highest expression of philosophical Hinduism. During the discourse, Krishna reveals his identity as the Supreme Being Himself, blessing Arjuna with an awe-inspiring glimpse of His divine absolute form. While translating this, the Song of God, Ramesh Menon has remained as consistently faithful to the original as possible, without overly compromising its poetry	2007	Rupa & Co.						ZZZ000000

9788129113115	Stolen Treasure And Other Stories	Rabindranath Tagore		Rabindranath Tagore was the first Bengali writer to elevate the short story to a serious art-form. Here in this collection are some of his finest stories that have been translated by a distinguished panel of translators to retain the delicate beauty of the original. Written mostly during the 1890s, these stories convey a variety of themes, showcase Tagore s reflections on contemporary rural and urban life, and serve as a commentary on the social issues of the time. Tagore s stories depict poignant human relationships within simple and relatively uneventful plots. In The Postmaster , a young orphaned girl employed by the postmaster in a remote village is devastated at being left behind by her master. The story Kabuliwallah concerns a man who appears crude and violent to the extent that he is imprisoned but is so sentimental about his faraway daughter that he cherishes a crumpled piece of paper because it is smudged with her fingerprints. Some of the stories also focus on the struggles of women in traditional Indian society, and explore prescribed roles and society's expectations. The Wife s Letter is among Bengali literature's earliest depictions of the bold emancipation of women. Broken Nest , a novella, revolves around the sensitive story of Charu, who is caught in an inescapable stasis. Several short stories involve elements of the supernatural. The Hungry Stones is about a man who becomes enchanted by invisible ghosts; in The Living and the Dead , a woman thought to be dead drowns herself to prove that she is alive. The short stories included in this collection are varied and representative of Tagore's range as a writer. Intermingled with psychological and social realism, these stories capture Tagore s innate humanism and profound sensibility.		Rupa & Co.						ZZZ000000

It analyzes Indian reactions to the western impact, particularly to British Rule and Christianity. It throws new light on the causes and consequences of the revolt of 1857. It examines the factors which contributed to the growth of a Pan-Indian nationalism. It discusses at length the increasing Indian discontent with British policies, the crystallization of Indian demands and the changing modes of political agitation and organization in the country. It shows how, by the late 1870s, sufficient modernization had taken place in India to provide conditions for the creation of a national organization on the conventional model, how efforts in that direction had already begun to be made and how the occurrence of political crises of systemic magnitude and the emergence of the right leadership during the viceroyalty of Lord Ripon (1880-1884) led to the successful launching of the Congress in December 1885.	2004	Rupa						ZZZ000000

The breathless haste with which today s urban go-getters pulse towards greater ambition and prosperity can well nigh destroy such a concern.

Unarguably fundamental for good health and zest, the pursuit of nutrition will have to be moulded into the daily weft and warp of a fast mutating middle-class.

9788129111302	The Raj Syndrome	Suhash Chakravarty		Told with verve, clarity, wit and at times with enlivening sarcasm, The Raj Syndrome is an original and persuasive portrayal of the broad parameters and intricate detours of imperial perceptions of India. Rudyard Kipling and Maud Diver stood at one end of the imperial spectrum signifying unflinching will and determination. Edward Morgan Forster and Edward Thompson stood at the other end of the same world view upholding various sentiments to buttress imperial mindset. The extravagant Round Table Group inherited in full measure the self righteous authoritarianism of John Strachey, James Fitzjames Stephen and Valentine Chirol. The Indian Conciliation Group and various sympathisers of an amorphous British Left of the 1930s and 40s sought to explore a human partnership between the ruler and the ruled within the same haughty empire. Despite tactical differences, Chakravarty argues, there was a strategic consensus that upheld imperial sensibility- they all served the empire. Impeccably researched, this is an extraordinarily vivid analysis of the complex men; institutions and perceptions of the imperial age. It is both gripping and rewarding.	2007	Rupa & Co.

So is the one that involves the ghost, the poachers who kill deer at night, and the Scarecrow. Are the poachers confounded at the end? That's a real thriller.	2004-01-01	Rupa & Co.						ZZZ000000
9788129108623	The second nose and other stories	Yashpal&Anand (journalist.)		The stories in this anthology, some of them appearing for the first time in English translation, seek to give a larger view of Yashpal as a short-story writer as well as provide a taste of his forthright approach to the questions of his times. Whether exploring the theme of the complicity of the ruled with the rulers, or the unquestioning supplication of human beings to a deity or faith, or social reform and social protest, the stories are coloured by the author's deep concern for the India he fought for and dreamt of. In a world weary of territorial strife, religious rancour and social iniquities, the stories are perhaps more relevant today than when they were written almost fifty years back.	2006	Rupa & Co.

9788129111227	The Ultimate Dialogue	Rishi Kumar Mishra		It is estimated that the Bhagwad Gita has been published in more than 2000 editions and translated into at least seventy-five languages. The number of commentaries to the Geeta is similarly plentiful. Why, then, the reader may ask, is there a need for yet another book drawing on the profound message of Shrimad Bhagwad Gita? In the author s view, the commentaries and translations to date have bypassed the scientific truths contained in the Gita, which is an index of the scientific principles enunciated by the rishis and contained within the Vedas. It is his objective to bring the broad framework of these valuable truths to light. This book offers an exposition of buddhi yoga, the real message of the Gita. Buddhi yoga is the union of knowledge (jnana) and action (karma) with intelligence (buddhi) and intentionality (nishtha). This work seeks to define these terms in their deeper rather than superficial sense, and then to indicate the paths and methods delineated in the Gita to achieve the desired fusion of knowledge, action and intelligence in our daily activities. Readers with a natural and keen interest in the pursuit of scientific thought (vijnana) will be entranced by the current work s exploration of far deeper and broader perspectives of the Gita than have been available heretofore.	2007	Rupa & Co.

I give you flowers , she once told to a sadhak, so that you may develop the Divine qualities they symbolise .In this book more than eight hundred flowers have been given by their botanical names along with their spiritual names and significances as revealed by the Mother.Almost each page of this book contains select passages from the writings of Sri Aurobindo and the Mother which help the readers to a deeper understanding of the silent messages of this beautiful creation of the nature.Though primarily a book of the Mother, Sri Aurobindo's touch is invariably felt since the spiritual significances of the flowers correspond to his incisive psychological analysis of the different planes of human consciousness and parts of the being.Beautifully produced, this unique book is a gracious benediction of the Mother and will be cherished as a treasure by all who love flowers.	1992	Sri Aurobindo Ashram						ZZZ000000

9788170586005	Savitri	Aurobindo		Savitri is Sri Aurobindo's major poetic work, an epic in blank-verse of about 24,000 lines in which a tale from the Mahabharata becomes a symbol of the human soul's spiritual quest and destiny.  The tale of Satyavan and Savitri , Sri Aurobindo noted, is recited in the Mahabharata as a story of conjugal love conquering death . Sri Aurobindo has widened the original legend and turned it into a symbol in which the soul of man, represented by Satyavan, is delivered from the grip of death and ignorance through the love and power of the Divine Mother, incarnated upon earth as Savitri.Sri Aurobindo worked on this poem for more than thirty years. When a disciple asked why he kept rewriting it, he replied: That is very simple. I used Savitri as a means of ascension. I began it on a certain mental level, each time I could reach a higher level I rewrote it from that level. . . In fact Savitri has not been regarded by me as a poem to be written and finished, but as a field of experimentation to see how far poetry could be written from one's own yogic consciousnes and how that could be made creative. The Mother considered Savitri to be the supreme revelation of Sri Aurobindo's vision and called it that marvellous prophetic poem which ill be humanity's guide towards its future realisation. (The demy size edition includes letters of Sri Aurobindo on Savitri.

9788170586838	Sri Aurobindo's Savitri: An Approach And A Study	A. B. Purani		Meant to acquaint readers with the general idea, the legend and the symbols behind the epic.The author states in the preface, Savitri is a great epic which ushers in a new age in poetic creation. Being a masterpiece of the greatest mystic of our times it does not lend itself easily to mere intellectual understanding. Its meaning, rather its Reality, is to be felt. One has to allow the vibration of it to sink into oneself, one has to arouse in himself the power of vision and see what the Master is showing. In course of reading Savitri with some friends I tried to make it better and more easily understood by acquainting them with the general idea, the symbols, the legend etc. This book is the result of putting all that material for the general reader. It is hoped that the book will fulfil its purpose of encouraging and helping earnest students to enter into the Master's great vision.	2002-01-01	Sri Aurobindo Ashram Publication Department						ZZZ000000

This book proposes that the pyramids may have been erected by the ancient Egyptians in an attempt to penetrate the secrets of their inner psychological structure, and the riddle of the Sphinx may be a mirror of unrevealed secrets in the human subconscious.

Using high-speed photography, Dr. Masaru Emoto discovered that crystals formed in frozen water reveal changes when specific, concentrated thoughts are directed toward them. He found that water from clear springs and water that has been exposed to loving words shows brilliant, complex, and colorful snowflake patterns. In contrast, polluted water, or water exposed to negative thoughts, forms incomplete, asymmetrical patterns with dull colors. The implications of this research create a new awareness of how we can positively impact the earth and our personal health.	2005-12-05	POCKET BOOKS						ZZZ000000
9781847370761	The Miracle of Water	Masaru Emoto		Dr Masaru Emoto has photographed thousands of water crystals during his years of research, but he has noticed the most beautiful crystals are formed after the water is exposed to the words 'love and gratitude'. In his new book, Dr Emoto uses his findings as the basis for a discussion on how the vibration and resonance of words can change your life. When we speak positive words, we send out a special vibration to others. They in turn emit positive words and, as a result, we are touched by the energy of love and gratitude. Words expressed in kindness and compassion are certain to result in positive effects for the giver. As Emoto says: 'If you shine a light on those around you with the words you use, you won't ever have to walk in the dark again.' This reflective, contemplative book explores water's critical role in transporting 'vibration information' to the body, and what we can learn from water crystals. There are compelling insights on using the lessons of resonance to mend disharmonious relationships, restore health and bring positive energy into your life.	2007-04-02	Simon & Schuster, Limited						ZZZ000000

9781847378873	Unplayable,An Inside Account of Tiger's Most Tumultuous Season	Robert Lusetich		Since his professional debut in 1996, Tiger Woods has reigned as the world's greatest living golfer, having singlehandledly increased the popularity of the game and become one of the most recognized faces in the world. His major knee surgery in 2008 and subsequent nine month absence from professional play raised questions about whether he would be able to return to the same level of play and fulfil his destiny that had before appeared all but assured. And more than just Tiger's legacy hung in the balance -- his continued winning was understood to be crucial for the entire sport, so the stakes were huge for fans, the pro tour, the networks, sponsors, not to mention all the individuals and businesses that make a living off golf. Robert Lusetich set out in January 2009 to follow Woods for the year. The only journalist to cover every tournament Tiger played, Lusetich interviewed tournament directors, agents, caddies, PGA Tour officials, sponsors, rival players and those inside Woods's camp, and has continued to cover Woods through the end of the season, including the subsequent scandal surrounding his marital infidelities. UNPLAYABLE is the definitive, comprehensive behind-the-scenes look at how the 2009 season unfolded for Woods, both personally and professionally. The book offers a richly compelling narrative of Tiger's victories and defeats -- all while conveying the untold story of the bitter rivalries and ongoing tensions among top players -- and explains how Woods managed to lead a double-life while dominating in one of the world's most competitive sports. Standing apart from all of the other reporting on the scandal to date, UNPLAYABLE gives much needed insight into how one of the world's most reclusive celebrities maintained a public persona at odds with his private life.	2010	Simon & Schuster, Limited						ZZZ000000
9780285636873	Residence on Earth	Pablo Neruda&Donald Devenish Walsh		Written in the span of two decades (1925-1945), beginning when Neruda was twenty-one, Residence on Earth was originally published in Spanish in three successive volumes (1933, 1935, 1947), all available in this definitive bilingual edition. Most of these poems were penned when Neruda was a self-exiled diplomat in isolated regions of South Asia. A vortex of time and being; of loneliness, cycles of the natural world, decay, destruction, silence, resurrection; of luminous solitude, blue oblivion, and of such deep melancholy that at one time Neruda considered renouncing the whole book and withdrawing it from circulation; of the erotic night, love's impulse, and memory's persistence; of odes to Lorca and lovers, elegies, songs, sonatas, and barcaroles; of the magnificent series of poems, Spain in Our Hearts, that Republican soliders of the Spanish civil war printed at the eastern front; of sea waves, landslides, jellyfish, and a planet of swords -- Residence on Earth is truly a work of intimate vastness, of lasting consummation.

9780285638051	The Dead Beat,The Perverse Pleasures of Obituaries	Marilyn Johnson		Once upon a time, journalism profs duly instructed their greenhorn grads to seek out community papers and the obit pages as logical entrance points into the world of newspaper reporting. Working for cash-strapped local papers allowed novices to practice writing everything from hard news to lifestyle features. Obituaries, meanwhile, were a rung on the ladder of major publications, albeit the lowest. The musty, dusty obit pages also traditionally hosted aging reporters put out to pasture. Not any more, argues Marilyn Johnson in her unabashedly knock-kneed love letter to the obit pages, The Dead Beat. Today, august publications like The New York Times, England's Daily Telegraph, Independent, and The Economist, and Canada's Globe and Mail use exalted members of the fourth estate to turn out smart, hip tributes to widespread, almost cultish, acclaim. Why? Because, as Johnson persuasively demonstrates in her book, truth is almost always stranger than fiction and a well-written, deeply researched obit is not only a vital historical record but a damn fine read over coffee and toast. "God is my assignment editor," cracks Richard Pearson of the Washington Post and if that isn't more interesting than what's going on in your city council chambers, author Johnson and those working the so-called Dead Beat don't know what is.	2007-10-18	Souvenir Press Limited						LAN008000
9780285637894	The Equation That Couldn't Be Solved,How Mathematical Genius Discovered the Language of Symmetry	Mario Livio		Mathematical symmetry is thought to be much too difficult for most laypeople to understand but this engaging bookapproaches it in an elegantly entertaining way. The title's formula is the "quintic" equation (involving x raised to the fifthpower), the analysis of which gave rise to "group theory," the mathematical apparatus scientists use to explore symmetry. A leading astrophysicist Livio keeps the science flowing withdigressions into human interest (e.g., the founder of group theory, Evariste Galois, was a revolutionary firebrand who died in 1832 at age 20 in a duel over "an infamous coquette"), pop psychology (women have more orgasms when their partners have symmetrical faces), and strategies for finding a soul mate, as well as appreciations of art and music.	2007-03-09	Souvenir						ZZZ000000

Barbarians at the Gate recounts this two-month battle with breathtaking pace and flair, and transports back to the Wall Street empire before it crumbled, through the boardroom doors, into the midnight meetings, the betrayals, the deal makers and publicity flaks, into a world where - as Nabisco CEO Ross Johnson put it - 'a few million dollars are lost in the sands of time'. Twenty years on, the world is once again recovering from a period of financial extravagance and irresponsibility.

9780099539056	Inside the Kingdom,Kings, Clerics, Modernists, Terrorists, and the Struggle for Saudi Arabia	Robert Lacey		Saudi Arabia is a country defined by paradox: it sits atop some of the richest oil deposits in the world, and yet the country s roiling disaffection produced sixteen of the nineteen 9/11 hijackers. It is a modern state, driven by contemporary technology, and yet its powerful religious establishment would have its customs and practices rolled back to match those of the Prophet Muhammed over a thousand years ago. In a world where events in the Middle East continue to have geopolitical consequences far beyond the region s boundaries, an understanding of this complex nation is essential. With Inside the Kingdom, British journalist and bestselling author Robert Lacey has given us one of the most penetrating and insightful looks at Saudi Arabia ever produced. More than twenty years after he first moved to the country to write about the Saudis at the end of the oil boom, Lacey has returned to find out how the consequences of the boom produced a society at war with itself. Filled with stories told by a broad range of Saudis, from high princes and ambassadors to men and women on the street, Inside the Kingdom is in many ways the story of the Saudis in their own words. It is a story of oil money that opened the door to Western ways, and produced a conservative backlash with effects that are still being felt today. It is a story of kings and princes who worried more about keeping power than the dangerous consequences of empowering radical clerics. It is a story of men who challenged orthodoxy and risked prison or death in the name of furthering open society, and of women who defied laws saying they should not write, drive, or play sports. And, at its heart, it is a story of a people attempting to reconcile the religious separatism of the past and the rapidly changing world with which they are increasingly intertwined. Their success or failure will have powerful reverberations in their own country, and across the globe.	2010	Random House						ZZZ000000
9780099478690	What Men Say, What Women Hear	Linda Papadopoulos		It comes as no surprise that men and women see things differently - from the way that they approach problems to how they deal with emotional difficulties - but when it comes to relationships, there is certainly never a dull moment. Just how can we penetrate the language barrier of 'manspeak'? What exactly does he mean when he says 'you have curves'? When he suggests you grab a coffee, does he just want a coffee or does he really want to grab a whole lot more? And why do we ever ask 'Does my bum look big in this?' when no answer on the face of this planet is ever correct? Dr Linda Papadopoulos takes us on a journey through a relationship lifespan from the first-date disasters through to meeting the parents and popping the Big Question and beyond, looking at the common pitfalls and how to avoid them. By utilising the principles of the revolutionary Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, we learn how to identify the problems, how to become more aware of our own thought processes and perceptions and how to analyse them to make communication that bit easier. Funny, frank and extremely accessible, What Men Say, What Women Hear is an indispensable guide for the modern woman who may be able to run countries, juggle a hectic household and power walk in high heels but who, no matter how hard she tries, just can't seem to understand what the man in her life means.	2009-04-02	ARROW						ZZZ000000

9781845966188	The Killer Within,In the Company of Monsters	Philip Carlo		As research for his acclaimed true-crime books, Philip Carlo has interviewed at length some of the most infamous criminals and killers of our times in prison and on death row. He has been able to forge a trusting relationship with his subjects, enabling him to extract the facts behind their infamy and identify what motivated them to commit their horrific crimes. His successful books reveal the truth about notorious characters such as LA serial killer Richard Ramirez (The Night Stalker), Mafia contract killer Richard Kuklinski (The Ice Man) and crime-family boss Anthony Casso (Gaspipe), and, working closely with the DEA, Carlo also wrote the definitive account of Bonanno Mafia family assassin Tommy 'Karate' Pitera (The Butcher). Carlo's investigative achievements are remarkable, but what wasn't known to his readers is that, while working on The Ice Man, he learnt he had amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a terminal illness that causes all of the muscles in the body to atrophy over time. Suddenly, after years of penetrating the minds of killers, Carlo was himself being pursued by the grim reaper. But rather than lying down and succumbing to the disease, Carlo continues to work; and his books are published to critical and commercial acclaim. In The Killer Within, Carlo documents his difficult experiences with ALS and explains how he has managed to continue working as a true-crime author in the face of adversity. He provides an intimate account of his relationships with Ramirez, Kuklinski and Casso and reveals intriguing information about writing his bestsellers, while simultaneously coping with the numerous challenges that ALS presents as it slowly begins to steal his life away.	2010-08-01	Mainstream Publishing Company, Limited						ZZZ000000

9781847921314	Scribble, Scribble, Scribble,Writing on Ice Cream, Obama, Churchill and My Mother	Simon Schama		'Wednesday brought a pungent sheepy smell emanating from the greyish lamb and barley soup my mother optimistically called 'Taste of the Garden of Eden'. Expel me, please. Haddock in the air? That would be Thursday. The faintest whiff of roasting garlic? That would be what my sister and I uncharitably dubbed 'Friday Night Memorial Chicken'; a venerable object smeared on the breasts with a dab of marmite meant to cheer the bird up as it emerged defeated from the oven. Rattling inside the brittle cavity was that one solitary clove of garlic; the exotic knobble that my mother conceded as a romantic touch amid the iron regimen of her unvarying weekly routine.' Cookery is not necessarily a subject one immediately associates with Simon Schama - one of Britain's most distinguished historians and commentators. But this selection of his occasional writings is a treasure trove of surprises. Passionate, provocative, entertaining and informative, Scribble, Scribble, Scribble ranges far and wide: from cookery and family to Barack Obama, from preaching and Shakespeare to Victorian sages, from Leonard Cohen and Hurricane Katrina to 'The Fate of Eloquence in the Age of The Osbornes'. Never predictable, always stimulating, Scribble, Scribble, Scribble allows us to view the world, in all its diversity, through the eyes of one of its most original inhabitants.	2010	Random House						ZZZ000000

9780099538042	Tinkers	Paul Harding		Winner of the 2010 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction. An old man lies dying. Confined to bed in his living room, he sees the walls around him begin to collapse, the windows come loose from their sashes, and the ceiling plaster fall off in great chunks, showering him with a lifetime of debris: newspaper clippings, old photographs, wool jackets, rusty tools, and the mangled brass works of antique clocks. Soon, the clouds from the sky above plummet down on top of him, followed by the stars, till the black night covers him like a shroud. He is hallucinating, in death throes from cancer and kidney failure. A methodical repairer of clocks, he is now finally released from the usual constraints of time and memory to rejoin his father, an epileptic, itinerant peddler, whom he had lost seven decades before. In his return to the wonder and pain of his impoverished childhood in the backwoods of Maine, he recovers a natural world that is at once indifferent to man and inseparable from him, menacing and awe inspiring. Heartbreaking and life affirming, TINKERS is an elegiac meditation on love, loss, and the fierce beauty of nature.	2010	Random House						ZZZ000000

9788129112163	Potpourri	Ruskin Bond		Ruskin Bond s Potpourri is a collection of his choicest stories from his treasure trove. Covering an array of themes horror, romance, humour, crime, and mystery ? these tales from the undisputable master storyteller form an eclectic blend in this book. Bond presents an evocative and affectionate memoir of vignettes of life in Mussoorie and other places he has visited, and introduces us to a rich cast of characters ? his family, friends, and those who have left a lasting impression on him. The stories with their diverse themes and flavours try to paint a realistic portrait of life, peppered as it is with multiple hues. As such, it condenses the pleasure of almost ten books in one. While He Said It with Arsenic lends a wicked touch, Love and Cricket adds a dash of romance to the compilation; The Overcoat takes us on a supernatural trip, while The Girl on the Train , with its sudden twists, snaps us out of our humdrum existence. Filled with warmth and gentle humour, this book captures the timeless rhythm of life in the mountains, adventures at sea, and thrill in an alien land.

9788129110749	Sex is not a four-letter word	Sudhakar Krishnamurti		True sex stories from a world- renowned andrologist  When it comes to the subject of sex, most people are self-taught knowalls. Nobody ever really reads a sex education book, except if in deep sexual trouble. Besides, there's an unjust stigma attached to being seen toting a sex manual.  But perhaps the most important reason why people don't read sex treatises and would much rather prefer to obtain al their information from harmful and miseducative pornographic resources is that porn is fun whereas education is boring.  It is not surprising, therefore, that so many sexual ignoramuses roam the earth, blissfully ignorant of their state, This is extremely dangerous in today's time and age, with its new sexual mores, moral codes and risks.  To bridge this gap, one needs a book that at once educates and entertains. A fun book is never embarrassing to carry, moreover.  Sex Is Not a Four Letter Word meets all these desiderata admirably well Written by internationally renowned andrologist and W.H.O sexual medicine expert Dr Sudhakar Krishnamurti, who is also a well known columnist and writer, this book packs a wealth of sexual medical information admixed with fun. The book is a compilation of true case histories presented in an essay format .Dr Krishnamurti uses a skilled combination of risqu humour, melancholia and hyperbole to make for unputdownable reading.  Sex Is Not A Four-Letter Word is a recommended read for all ages. It is not just for the sexually challenged.	2007-05-30	Sex is Not a FourLetter Word						ZZZ000000

His mother tries to starve him out; he retaliates by attacking her internal organs.

The neighbourhood, Paris's bubbling Belleville quarter, is already in uproar, because half a dozen other grannies have been found with their shrivelled throats slit. Into this tense situation stumbles Benjamin Malaussene, with his overly complicated life: his multitude of dependant siblings, their fecund and scatty mother, his stinking epileptic dog, Julius, and his journalist lover Julie, who would dearly like to keep all these complications to a minimum. Benjamin's unusual profession — that of scapegoat in a publishing house — makes him the ideal person to be framed for just about everything, and he is. Meanwhile, two policemen are putting their all into solving the case: Van Thian, a cop ingeniously disguised, and his cherubic partner, Pastor. The criminal galaxy explodes (not to mention the Paris police force) when the anarchic worlds of Benjamin, Julie, Thian, Pastor and the whole of Belleville finally collide ... The Fairy Gunmother is an old-fashioned thriller studded with a brilliantly new-fashioned wit.	2003	Rupa & Co.						ZZZ000000

9780618247271	The guru of love	Samrat Upadhyay		Writing of Samrat Upadhyay's debut story collection, critics raved: "like a Buddhist Chekhov . . . speak[s] to common truths . . . startlingly good" (San Francisco Chronicle) and "subtle and spiritually complex" (New York Times). Upadhyay's first novel showcases his finest writing and his signature themes. The Guru of Love is a moving and important story — important for what it illuminates about the human need to love as well as lust, and for the light it shines on the political situation in Nepal and elsewhere. Ramchandra is a math teacher earning a low wage and living in a small apartment with his wife and two children. Moonlighting as a tutor, he engages in an illicit affair with one of his tutees, Malati, a beautiful, impoverished young woman who is also a new mother. She provides for him what his wife, who comes from a privileged background, does not: desire, mystery, and a simpler life. Complicating matters are various political concerns and a small city bursting with the conflicts of modernization, a static government, and a changing population. Just as the city must contain its growing needs, so must Ramchandra learn to accommodate both tradition and his very modern desires. Absolutely absorbing yet deceptively simple, this novel cements Upadhyay's emerging status as one of our most exciting new writers.	2003	Houghton Mifflin						ZZZ000000

9788129103154	The spirit of indian architecture,vedantic wisdom of architecture for building harmonious spaces and life	Darshan Kumar Bubbar		This path-breaking book addresses several issues for the very first time and reveals many findings about Indian architecture in details never researched or published before. This project is the culmination of the author’s entire lifetime’s work. The Strength of the paradigm he proposed lies in the fact that it makes the reader sit up and take notice of the glaring defects in the thinking, planning and implementation to how we build and utilize space for living, working, and sharing our environment with our co-habitats. He then provides solutions for an organic and symbiotic way of development that can be scaled up right from a single dwelling to as large as a whole township. The author is non-dogmatic and non-religious in his approach and proposes radical yet simple solutions with scientific explanations and rationale behind his methods. He is quick to point out that this is a book written in the modern context and even the word spirit used in the title has not been used in any spiritual sense, but refers to the essence, the core. He has been an experimenter and a truth-seeker all his life and here he shares the result of his findings with the reader who can benefit at every level. The target readership of this book would be anyone from a student of architecture to an accomplished architect, urban planners, educationists and policy makers, and indeed anyone who is interested in improving the quality of life. In its finality, the book, a textbook, as the author likes to call it, is not only a unique work on architecture but on the art of living itself. Darshan Kumar Bubbar was born in 1937 in Quetta, Balochistan. Since an early age, he showed an incredible talent in his drawings, which eventually led him to join the field of architecture. Before commencing his formal education at the Academy of Architecture, Mumbai, he worked with eminent architects in Delhi for years. Which served as a rigorous training ground for him. He started his own practice in 1965 under the name and style of The Angles Architects, and today the firm continues to furnish complete services in the field of design and execution of building, planning and interior projects. His work has ranged from designing houses, bungalows and housing complexes to educational campuses, hospitals, offices, residential and institutional buildings and even interiors with furniture design. In the early sixties, he began to study Indian architecture. The mud houses in villages, the palaces of Rajasthan and The Mud houses in villages, the palaces of Rajasthan and the Taj Mahal cast a deep impression on him. He was in search of design principles ha the ancients followed in their work.

9788170585886	Living Words	Compiled From The Works Of Sri Aurobindo&The Mother		The central message of the book is that evolution – which is a progressive unfoldment of the Spirit through progressively higher levels of consciousness – has reached a stage where the next leap of consciousness is preparing to take place, the leap from mind to that which is beyond mind – the Supermind.The writings of Sri Aurobindo and the Mother are felt as communicating not so much to the mind as to the soul. The words do not just convey certain ideas but also induce a psychic or soul state of consciousness. They are living words, vibrant with a consciousness that is greater than that of the mind. The words have the ring of the spirit and are capable of kindling the spirit when one is in a receptive state. The great majority of extracts contained in this book have been selected because of this quality.	2005-01-01	Sri Aurobindo Ashram Publication Department						ZZZ000000

Subjects include faith, bhakti, visions and symbols, etc.Extract: Faith does not depend upon experience; it has something that is there before experience. When one starts the Yoga, it is not usually on the strength of experience, but on the strength of faith. It is so not only in Yoga and the spiritual life, but in ordinary life also. All men of action, discoverers, inventors, creators of knowledge proceed by faith and, until the proof is made or the thing done, they go on in spite of disappointment, failure, disproof, denial because of something in them that tells them that this is the truth, the thing that must be followed and done. Ramakrishna even went so far as to say, when asked whether blind faith was not wrong, that blind faith was the only kind to have, for faith is either blind or it is not faith but something else – reasoned inference, proved conviction or ascertained knowledge.Faith is the soul's witness to something not yet manifested, achieved or realised, but which yet the Knower within us, even in the absence of all indications, feels to be true or supremely worth following or achieving...– Sri Aurobindo	1995-05-01	Sri Aurobindo Ashram						HEA025000

9788170581772	The Hidden Forces Of Life	Sri Aurobindo&The Mother		A retrospective review of the course of one's life is apt to reveal that most of the past events of one's life, including those which seemed to be the outcome of one's conscious choice, were unplanned and due to some unforeseen happenings or chance events such as meeting somebody, receiving a suggestion from somebody or somewhere, coming across a book, visiting a certain place, etc. A good deal of mystery and unpredictability also surrounds what happens to one's life internally from day to day or even from hour to hour—the alternation of moods, the upsurges of impulses, the kindling of emotions, etc.According to those who can see behind the external appearance of things, the key to such mystery behind the internal as well as external events and vicissitudes of our lives consists in the fact that all life is a play of hidden forces; we live and move in a world of forces of which we are almost totally unaware.This book is a compilation from the works of Sri Aurobindo and the Mother on the hidden forces of life which act on us influencing our thoughts, feelings and actions and determining the course of events in life.	1990	Sri Aurobindo Ashram Publication Department						ZZZ000000

Having appreciated the high points of these approaches, we are brought to the essence of all yogic effort – change of consciousness – and the stages and means by which this is accomplished. This leads us to the Integral Yoga of Sri Aurobindo in which the quintessence of all past yogas is combined with the new dimensions of human evolution and the new consciousness that is forming with the dawn of a new age.	2007-01-01	Sri Aurobindo Ashram Publication Department						ZZZ000000
