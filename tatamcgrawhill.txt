9780070582095	A Complaint is a Gift	BARLOW	PaperBack	Customer complaints can give businesses a wake-up call when they're not achieving their fundamental purpose---meeting customer needs. Complaints provide a feedback mechanism that can help organizations rapidly and inexpensively shift products, service style, and market focus. Unfortunately many businesses dodge responsibility for a customer's dissatisfaction, believing that complaining customers are trying to get something for free or that the problem is the customer's fault. Businesses who don't value their customers' complaints suffer from costly, negative word-of-mouth advertising. A Complaint Is a Gift also tells how to create complaint-friendly organizations by encouraging customers to speak out. It outlines communication structures that can facilitate the movement of complaints from frontline staff to upper management, allowing customer-identified problems to be fixed within the company. Complaint-friendly cultures are described in detail, and specific structures are suggested that can be adopted by companies interested in becoming complaint-friendly. A Complaint Is a Gift repositions the role of complaints in business-and argues that handling customer complaints is not just about making customers feel better. It is a book for individuals and companies to deal with complaints in a new and refreshing way. It also brings together three decades of customer dissatisfaction research and shows how companies can use this information to change internal policies and practices.

9780070703612	Training & Collaboration with Virtual Worlds	Heiphtez	PaperBack	Virtual worlds are a rapidly maturing technology with powerful business applications, particularly in training and recruiting fields. As businesses face massive wave of baby-boomer retirement within the next five to ten years, many come to recognize that training is no longer a support function, but a matter of survival. Second Life and other virtual worlds are tools that should be considered as a part of any comprehensive knowledge transfer and training program, as well as any serious recruitment effort. A Forrester Research report earlier this year goes so far as to state that "within five years, the 3D Internet will become as important to companies as the Web is today." Virtual worlds take e-learning one crucial step farther - rather than simply utilizing online applications, employees are acting, in virtual reality, through robotic avatars. Team-building and training exercises can be conducted simultaneously with employees scattered across the globe. Their behavior is tracked and recorded automatically, so that strengths and weaknesses are immediately obvious and indisputable. Results can then be routed safely back to your corporate database, for future reference. This book teaches readers all they need to know about the business use of virtual worlds, with the emphasis on Second Life - what they are, what you need to start a successful training or recruitment program in Second Life, and how it's already being used by a variety of well-respected corporate players. Special attention is paid to security issues and concerns, as well as real-life implementations and use of training simulations to achieve competitive advantage and high R.O.I.

9780070702288	A Compass to Fulfillment	Inamori	PaperBack	The founder of Kyocera and KDDI, two of Japan's most respected and globally influential corporations, Kazuo Inamori is frequently praised in classic business books for his obvious business savvy and forward-thinking management expertise. But in A Compass to Fulfillment, which will be translated from the book's original Japanese into English, it is Inamori who takes charge of relaying the personal philosophies that have formed the cornerstone of his business success. Here, Inamori draws on the grounding that his Buddhist faith has provided him and writes as much from the experience of his remarkable career even as he writes from the heart. He is enormously successful by any measure, but for Inamori, all success comes from within: knowing who you are, having strong principles, doing the right thing.In this book, the Japanese edition of which has sold over 500,000 copies, Inamori guides readers in realigning their spiritual compasses by going back to the basics-to the fundamental question that cannot be avoided: What is the purpose of life? In answering this essential question, readers are able to take a break from the daily beat of existence, reflect, and establish a philosophy that will serve as a true compass, no matter what the terrain.In A Compass to Fulfillment, Inamori provides mental models for understanding how our actions and our spirit affect the results we get. He shows how negative thinking will always produce a negative result. And by example, he suggests ways for how our internal compass can navigate the way through the murky waters of business and life. In Inamori's words, I'd like to make you rethink your purpose in life and work; I'd like to make you reconsider how you choose to live each day; I'd like to make you want to live life more vitally, passionately, and yes-spiritually. I say all this even as I fully understand that to change ourselves is a more difficult task than we have ever faced.	March-10	Tata McGrawHill	160	English	0.22kg	217x142x11mm	1	ZZZ000000

They are seemingly contradictory but in fact complimentary. As Martin Luther King put it, "Power without love is reckless and abusive, and love without power is sentimental and anemic." Using revealing stories from complex situations he has been involved in all over the world the Middle East, South Africa, Europe, India, Guatemala, the Philippines, Australia, Canada and the United States Kahane reveals how to dynamically balance these two forces. Just as when we are toddlers we learn to shift from one foot to the other to move ourselves forward, so we can learn to shift back and forth between power and love in order to move society forward.

Writing in their trademark witty, fast-paced style, Ries and Trout explain how to position an industry leader so that it gets into people's minds and stays there, how to position a follower so that it can occupy a space not claimed by the leader, and how to avoid letting a second product ride on the coattails of an established one.

Using the metaphor of an airplane trip from coast to coast, Flight Plan shows that the real secret to success is to first figure out your destination - where you want to go - and lock in on it. Second, you must take off-identify precisely what you must do to achieve the goals you have set for yourself and take action. And third, you must persist through the inevitable challenges and setbacks-by making continual course corrections-until you reach your destination. Tracy observes that any airplane, headed for any destination, will be off course 99 percent of the time because of air turbulence. But, by locking in on its destination, taking off, and making continual course corrections, the plane will arrive as scheduled. The same is true of peoples journey through life.

9780070606401	What Customers Want	ULWICK	PaperBack	Based on more than 200 studies spanning more than seventy companies and twenty-five industries, Ulwick contends that, when it comes to innovation, the traditional methods companies use to communicate with customers are the root cause of chronic waste and missed opportunity. In What Customers Want, Ulwick demonstrates that all popular qualitative research methods yield well-intentioned but unfitting and dreadfully misleading information that serves to derail the innovation process. Rather than accepting customer inputs such as "needs," "benefits," "specifications," and "solutions," Ulwick argues that researchers should silence the literal "voice of the customer" and focus on the "metrics that customers use to measure success when executing the jobs, tasks or activities they are trying to get done." Using these customer desired outcomes as inputs into the innovation process eliminates much of the chaos and variability that typically derails innovation initiatives.With the same profound insight, simplicity, and uncommon sense that propelled The Innovator's Solution to worldwide acclaim, this paradigm-changing book details an eight-step approach that uses outcome-driven thinking to dramatically improve every aspect of the innovation process--from segmenting markets and identifying opportunities to creating, evaluating, and positioning breakthrough concepts.

Kouzes, Chairman Emeritus, Tom Peters Company, and coauthor of The Leadership Challenge and Encouraging the Heart Personal advantage: the book is designed to help unearth and leverage this unique, distinctive edge. It might be your look, your personality, a character trait, your demeanor, the people you know, the resources you possess or even a well-crafted plan to bolster your popularity in the workplace. Whatever it may be, everyone has an untapped advantage just below the surface. Finding that edge and using it effectively is what separates the top 1% of successful people from the remaining 99 percent. The author explores key questions to discovering this personal edge and implementing it to achieve success: How can you discover--or create--your own advantage? To uncover an unexploited edge, you must find and focus on the unique attributes you possess. It means asking yourself:What are my most appealing characteristics? Do I have a physical edge? What relationships am I willing to leverage to become a top performer? How do other people see me? What innate qualities can I utilize that will help ingratiate myself to the right influential people?Discovering your own personal assets is the first part of the equation, as explored in this book. Numerous top performers' examples--some ingenious and others surprisingly simple--illustrate how the top 1% achieved their own extraordinary success through their personalized advantage.
