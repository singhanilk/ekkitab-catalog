9781416526377	Diamonds, Gold and War,The Making of South Africa	Martin Meredith		"While Americans were heading west during the nineteenth century in search of land, riches, and adventure, the whites of southern Africa moved northward from the Cape Colony outpost into the African interior on a similar journey. Southern Africa had once been regarded as a worthless jumble of British colonies, Boer republics, and African chiefdoms, a troublesome region of little interest to the outside world. But in 1871, prospectors exploring a remote stretch of sun-scorched scrubland chanced upon the world's richest deposits of diamonds. Fifteen years later, an itinerant digger stumbled across the rocky outcrop of a gold-bearing reef on a highveld ridge known as the Witwatersrand. Beneath lay the richest deposits of gold ever discovered." "What followed was a titanic struggle between the British and the Boers for control of the region. It culminated in the costliest, bloodiest, and most humiliating war that Britain had waged in nearly a century, and left the Boer republics devastated. The Anglo-Boer War played as important a part in the making of modern South Africa as did the Civil War in the development of the United States." "Two men personified this struggle: Cecil Rhodes, the son of an English country parson who used his huge fortunes from diamonds and gold to promote the expansion of the British empire as well as his own business interests; and Paul Kruger, the Boer leader and landowner, whose only education was the Bible, who believed the earth was flat, but who defied Britain's prime ministers and generals for nearly a quarter of a century." "In this history of the turbulent years leading up to the founding of the modern state of South Africa in 1910, Martin Meredith portrays the great wealth and raw power, the deceit, corruption, and racism that lay behind Britain's empire-building in southern Africa."--BOOK JACKET.	2008-07-07	Pocket Books - Uk						ZZZ000000
9781416526384	Female chauvinist pigs,women and the rise of raunch culture	Ariel Levy		Today's young women seem to be outdoing the male chauvinist pigs of yesteryear, applauding the 'pornification' of other women, and themselves. This is a world where simulating sex for baying crowds of men on shows like Girls Gone Wild and going to lapdancing clubs - as patrons - is seen as a short cut to cool. Ariel Levy says the joke's on the women if they think this is progress. She tears apart the myth of this new brand of 'empowered woman' and refuses a culture-wide obligation for women to act and look like porn stars. This terrifically witty and wickedly intelligent book makes the case that the rise of raunch does not represent how far women have come - it proves only how far women have left to go.	2006	Pocket						ZZZ000000

9781416599418	Creative capitalism,a conversation with Bill Gates, Warren Buffett, and other economic leaders	Michael Kinsley&Conor Clarke		Bill Gates is more than the world's most successful capitalist; he's also the world's biggest philanthropist.Gates has approached philanthropy the same way he revolutionized computer software: with a fierce ambition to change the rules of the game. That's why at the 2008 annual meeting of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Gates advocated a creative capitalism in which big corporations, the distinguishing feature of the modern global economy, integrate doing good into their way of doing business.This controversial new idea is discussed and debated by the more than forty contributors to this book, among them three Nobel laureates and two former U.S. cabinet secretaries. Edited by author and columnist Michael Kinsley, Creative Capitalism started as a first-of-its-kind online conversation that brought together some of the world's best minds to engage Gates's challenge. From Warren Buffett, who seconds Gates's analysis, to Lawrence Summers, who worries about the consequences of multiple corporate objectives, the essays cover a broad spectrum of opinion. Judge Richard Posner dismisses Gates's proposal as trumped-up charity that will sap the strengths of the profit-maximizing corporation, while journalist Martin Wolf maintains that the maximization of profit is far from universally accepted, and rightly so. Chicago Nobel laureate Gary Becker wonders whether altruistic companies can survive in a competitive economy, while Columbia Nobel laureate Edmund Phelps argues that a little altruism might be the right prescription for a variety of market imperfections.Creative Capitalism is not just a book for philanthropists. It's a book that challenges the conventional wisdom about our economic system, a road map for the new global economy that is emerging as capitalism adapts itself once again to a changing world.	2008	Simon & Schuster						ZZZ000000

9781577316527	Soul Currency	Ernest D Chu		What is the secret for doing what really fulfils you and making lots of money doing it? Most of us are still searching for that elusive formula. More than two out of three workers are interested in changing careers, the highest rate ever, according to the American Bureau of Labour Statistics. More than 80 percent of the people polled by the Gallup organization in a lifestyle survey said they would take a cut in pay doing what they liked if they still could make a good living. Soul Currency will demonstrate the steps of how to (a) listen to your soul's passion, (b) seek what fulfils you and serves others, and (c) create a living by becoming alive with what fulfils and interests you by creating a prosperous flow of loving energy-soul currency. Ernest Chu believes that our spiritual assets are the most powerful resource for fulfillment and success. They include what psychologists today call "multiple intelligences" - our innate gifts (for example, intention, intuition, intelligence), as well as learned qualities (for example, integrity, determination, persistence). But we casually dismiss or devalue many of these. Once we clearly understand our true soul worth, or soul's chi, and perceive the gap between this and our material worth, we are empowered to balance the two. Chu uses terms such as assets, capital, liquidity, and the like, to talk about aspects of intelligence that more powerfully exist in the invisible universe. He describes ways for readers to activate the flow of soul currency, the flow of energy, and how to discover and remove whatever blocks that flow. SOUL CURRENCY describes how readers can increase material abundance through using this spiritual capital by developing their ability to focus, set intentions, and draw upon spiritual inner assets. Overall fulfilment draws upon an awareness of spirit giving thoughts and actions meaning and greater purpose, and thus it is only by focusing on the spiritual side of life that the material side becomes what we desire. Throughout the book, Chu uses real-world success stories and offers practical exercises so that every reader can experience the abundant flow of their own, unique soul currency.	2008-10-01	New World Library						REL000000

And I wanted to tell you that I loved your part about [finding your] mission...I am a Muslim and I loved everything you wrote there." -Sadiq Lakhani, Karachi, Pakistan "Many thanks! ...You have been giving and will eternally give so much hope and self-belief, respect, and recognition to millions of human beings around the globe, including myself! -Rudolf H. Messinger Chief, Recruitment & Career Development UNICEF Headquarters "I have just got a new job thanks to you and your book. I had been the head of a professional country club in Australia for eight years and one day had enough and just walked out wanting a career change but not knowing what I wanted to do. ..The flower exercise gave me direction and some ideas of careers to pursue; at the top of my list was auctioneer. ...As a result I have just landed a new career in the auction industry. Many thanks for everything that you have done for me." -Mitchell Hogg, Mont Albert, Australia "Many moons ago I purchased the very first edition of What Color Is Your Parachute?, took your suggestions to heart, did all the exercised, and took action. Now, thirty years later I have my own business which provides unemployment-related support and courses. ...Thanks very much for this and all your invaluable work/help over the years. I find that-even with all the information out there about searching for a job-most people are woefully unprepared for it I hope, like you, that we can do our part to change that." -Ed Osborne Unemploymentville.com "I first read What Color is Your Parachute? in the late 70s. It changed the course of my life by putting me onto a personal career path in the field of career development. Thanks to you, I found my passion in helping others find work they love." -Shelley Canter, author of All the Right Moves: 15 Secrets to Land a Top Job "I want to respond to something you mentioned in your book...in effect you said that many people have contacted you to tell you that they were profoundly or significantly impacted by just one or two sentences in your book. Well, you can add me to that list! Hallelujah!" -Paul Misuraca "Your incredibly useful and inspiring book What Color is Your Parachute? is one of the few career books that I've read many times and it was your book that inspired me to leave the secure job I had in a large consulting company and follow my passion for working with small companies and eventually start my own publishing company with my husband." -Nataly Kogan President, Natavi Guides "I am an unemployed Chemical Engineer living in Nairobi, Kenya. I first came across your 1988 edition of What Color is Your Parachute? while studying in Moscow in 1995. I have managed to get at least four jobs using the techniques you so well describe." -Andrew Amadi, Nairobi, Kenya "With usual eager anticipation, I opened wide (like a parachute!) the cogent, timely, engaging words on the 413+ pages of What Color is Your Parachute?-your 2002 edition. I'm pursuing a career change: from data processing to teaching mathematics. You strongly encourage job-seekers to start "small," so I'm beginning with tutoring a few persons for a local home-based business. I found many, many aspects of your awesomely helpful job-hunter & career-changer manual very appealing...Mr. Bolles, you have graced the realm and reality of millions of persons searching for new or different jobs for 27+ years, as you state in your book, and may you continue to do so indefinitely."  -John W. Morse I am honored and grateful that you responded to my email. Thank you! ...My interview for the part-time receptionist position went well and the 'thank you, I remain interested' note has been posted and emailed. Your book is helping me to help myself. Bless you, I will keep you posted." -Denise "I am a fairly recent college graduate and have been working as a headhunter for a year and a half. Recently I was offered a career counseling position, one that wanted 3-5 years of experience. But I got it with only a year and a half of relevant experience! I owe it, in part, to reading and learning from your book. Thank you." -Shannon Hatfield "I was fired last Halloween and was living on my 401k, feeling despondent and not getting anywhere in my job search. An excellent friend highly recommended that I get your book even though I had limited funds-she insisted it would pay for itself. ...In two days, I got interviews with decision-makers in the field I am interested in by using the methods described in your book. Thank you thank you thank you!!! -Devon Thornton  "I have read your book twice, once in 1993 to find my current job and once again this year to find a new job I start in two weeks. Your advice is excellent. It is not just helpful practically in a job hunt but also has the wider use of helping what priorities and directions I have in life. Even in simple financial terms it has repaid my original small investment many times over. My thanks for your help." -Nick Holliman I was let go from the special sales department of Morrow in a reorganization. I was only out of work for a few weeks but during that time I went to the local branch of the public library every day with my brand new copy of What color is your parachute. I diligently worked my way through the book. Photocopying the work sheets. Filling in the petals of my flowers, listing my priorities. Discovering what I was accomplished at, my past successes. It was hard not to spend that time working the phone, having lunches. It was hard when my husband would come home from work and ask what did you do today. Somehow I knew that following this guide was important. When I was offered a job, I referred back to what I had written, yes, I like to work with women, yes, it was a short commute, yes, the new job was about children's books. Although the new job didn't hit all the points I was confident that it was a good fit. A year later more than one person suggested that I might be happy as a children's librarian. As I considered this radical life change- public service, graduate school, the unknown, I perused my notebook. This time the new job and my priorities matched perfectly. Working for a non-profit, working with women and children, short commute, life-long learning, independent projects, working with a team, opportunity to grow, no two days alike, working with the public, children's books. Whoa. It is 15 years later and I am still a children's librarian. I can say I owe my fabulous job as a children's librarian in a lab school for pre-k to 8th grade, that I teach graduate students children's literature, that I write about children's books for national magazines, that I haveserved on the Newbery Committee and Notable Children's Books, I owe it all to those days spent in that old Carnegie Library laboriously filling in the blanks, trusting that something would come of those hours of reflection and examination. Yes, What Color Is Your Parachute changed my life. -Lisa Von Drasek	2009	Ten Speed Press						ZZZ000000

It is a city that never ceases to shock those who pass through, and it is also a city that manages to delight and enthrall those who are stalwart enough to stay and brave enough to make an effort to look, and to see. Best-selling writer Simon Winchester explores his love-hate relationship with Calcutta, a city that provokes intense reactions in all who visit. Collaborating with his son Rupert, Simon muses on his time spent in Calcutta, reflecting on his experiences, preconceptions and own individual fascination with the city. Thw Winchesters' personal essays are presented with a selection of wide-ranging extracts penned by other visitors to this surprising city. The result is a personal view of one of the world's most resonant destinations that also acts as an essential introduction to the wealth of writing on the subject. Includes extracts by V.S. Naipaul, Paul Theroux, Rudyard Kipling, Geoffrey Moorhouse, Rabindranath Tagore, N.C. Chaudhuri, Gunter Grass, Dominique Lapierre, James Morris, Mark Twain and Vikram Seth.

9781844138104	What Men Say, What Women Hear	Linda Papadopoulos		It comes as no surprise that men and women see things differently - from the way that they approach problems to how they deal with emotional difficulties - but when it comes to relationships, there is certainly never a dull moment. Just how can we penetrate the language barrier of 'manspeak'? What exactly does he mean when he says 'you have curves'? When he suggests you grab a coffee, does he just want a coffee or does he really want to grab a whole lot more? And why do we ever ask 'Does my bum look big in this?' when no answer on the face of this planet is ever correct? Dr Linda Papadopoulos takes us on a journey through a relationship lifespan from the first-date disasters through to meeting the parents and popping the Big Question and beyond, looking at the common pitfalls and how to avoid them. By utilising the principles of the revolutionary Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, we learn how to identify the problems, how to become more aware of our own thought processes and perceptions and how to analyse them to make communication that bit easier. Funny, frank and extremely accessible, What Men Say, What Women Hear is an indispensable guide for the modern woman who may be able to run countries, juggle a hectic household and power walk in high heels but who, no matter how hard she tries, just can't seem to understand what the man in her life means.	2008-09-04	Century						ZZZ000000

9781846041129	The third Jesus: how to find truth and love in today's world	Deepak Chopra		In this dazzling book, one of the most influential spiritual thinkers of our time provides an answer that is as challenging as it is uplifting. Deepak Chopra searches for the Christ who stands at the heart of Christianity and discovers the identity of Jesus is threefold. Firstly, there is Jesus the man, who lived over 2000 years ago and whose sermons form the foundation of Christian theology. Secondly, there is Jesus the Son of God, who represents a specific branch of religion. Finally, there is the Third Jesus, the spiritual guide whose teachings embrace humanity as a whole. By considering each of these separate figures, Chopra allows us to decide for ourselves which of them speaks the most clearly to us today. As we become familiar with the universal wisdom of Christ, most especially through the guidance of the Third Jesus, we may become more open to a truly loving spirituality. And we will begin to create a brighter future, free from hatred fuelled by religious fundamentalism.	2009-02-05	Rider						ZZZ000000

9781847370556	The Machine That Changed the World	James P. Womack&Daniel T. Jones&Daniel Roos		When James Womack, Daniel Jones, and Daniel Roos wrote THE MACHINE THAT CHANGED THE WORLD in 1990, Japanese automakers, and Toyota in particular, were making a strong showing by applying the principles of lean production. However, the full power of lean principles was unproven, and they had not been applied outside of the auto industry. Today, the power of lean production has been conclusively proved by Toyota's unparalleled success, and the concepts have been widely applied in many industries including services. Based on MIT's pioneering global study of industrial competition, THE MACHINE THAT CHANGED THE WORLD offers a groundbreaking analysis of the entire lean business system, including product development, supplier management, sales, service, and production - an analysis even more relevant today as GM and Ford struggle to survive and a wide range of American companies embrace lean production. A new Foreword by the authors brings the story up to date and details how their predictions were right. As a result, this reissue of a classic is as insightful and instructive today as when first published.	2007-03-31	Simon & Schuster						ZZZ000000

More than just a book, The Impulse Factor provides a clear understanding of why we make the choices we do - and the tools to turn those decisions into something great.	2009-01-05	Simon + Schuster UK						ZZZ000000

The rule is deceptively simple: when faced with a decision, determine the consequences and outcomes of your various options in 10 minutes, 10 months, and 10 years; but the results are extraordinary. Using the framework of 10-10-10 will allow you to sort out the ramifications of your decisions and to match them with the expectations and values you hold dearest. Most importantly, it allows you to chart a path in the direction you want, and to head confidently towards it with focus, balance, and joy.	2009-04-20	Simon & Schuster, Limited						ZZZ000000
9781847374400	Women, Work, and the Art of Savoir Faire,Business Sense and Sensibility	Mireille Guiliano		This is a book about life, how to make the most of it, how to find your balance when you are working long days and trying to be happy and fulfilled.

9781847374677	Hollywood Foto-Rhetoric,The Lost Manuscript	Bob Dylan		The portrait of a very young Bob Dylan on the cover of 'The Times They Are a Changin' is probably one of the most recognizable and famous album covers of all time. Photographer Barry Feinstein took that photo, as well as many more of Dylan throughout his career. His images have been published throughout the world many times over, and have become synonymous with our perceptions of that place and time in rock and folk music history. Inspired by a series of photographs that Feinstein took in Hollywood during the 1950s and 60s, Bob Dylan wrote an extraordinary series of poems that have remained unpublished for decades. They are thought-provoking, witty and erudite observations of the world; through the lens of Feinstein's photographs, they speak volumes about the anonymous faces and places of Los Angeles, and offer wry commentary on images of stars and legends in the neighbourhood at the time. Photos of Frank Sinatra, Marlene Dietrich, Judy Garland float through the book, as do poignant images of starlets, casting couches, employment agencies and palm tree'd boulevards. Feinstein was there with a camera to capture some world-famous events, such as Marilyn Monroe's memorial service, and he photographed the forgettable moments, preserving them perfectly and timelessly. Bob Dylan's unsettling and distinctly unique perspective informs and enlivens every page, an irresistible interpretive voice narrating the visual images from photo to photo.	2008-11-17	Simon & Schuster, Limited						BIO005000

9781847374981	The Leader In Me	Stephen R. Covey		Children in today's world are inundated with information about who to be, what to do and how to live. But what if there was a way to teach children how to manage priorities, focus on goals and be a positive influence on the world around them? The Leader in Me is that programme. It's based on a hugely successful initiative carried out at the A.B. Combs Elementary School in North Carolina. To hear the parents of A. B Combs talk about the school is to be amazed. In 1999, the school debuted a programme that taught The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People to a pilot group of students. The parents reported an incredible change in their children, who blossomed under the programme. By the end of the following year the average end-of-grade scores had leapt from 84 to 94. This book will launch the message onto a much larger platform. Stephen R. Covey takes the 7 Habits, that have already changed the lives of millions of people, and shows how children can use them as they develop. Those habits -- be proactive, begin with the end in mind, put first things first, think win-win, seek to understand and then to be understood, synergize, and sharpen the saw -- are critical skills to learn at a young age and bring incredible results, proving that it's never too early to teach someone how to live well.	2008-11-18	Simon + Schuster UK						ZZZ000000

9781847375353	Secrets of a Buccaneer Scholar,Self-Education and the Pursuit of Passion	James Bach		Like so many young people, James Bach, the son of the famous author Richard Bach (Jonathan Livingston Seagull) struggled in school. While he excelled in subjects that interested him, he barely passed the courses that didn't. By the time he was sixteen he had dropped out. He taught himself computer programming and software design and started working as a manager at Apple Computers only four years later - and he never looked back. With The Secrets of a Buccaneer Scholar, James shows us how he developed his own education on his own terms, how that unorthodox education brought him success, and how the reader can do it too. In his uniquely pithy and anecdotal style James uses the metaphor of a buccaneer to describe anyone whose love of learning and pursuit of knowledge is not bound by institutions or authorities. James outlines the eleven elements of his self-education method and shows how every reader - simply investing time and passion into educating themselves about the things that really interest them - can develop a method for acquiring knowledge and expertise that fits their temperaments and showcases their unique abilities and skills. Particularly well-suited for an audience grappling with the challenges posed by the internet, but also appropriate for parents looking to help and school their children or employees hoping to jumpstart their careers, The Secrets of a Buccaneer Scholar is a groundbreaking and uplifting work that empowers and inspires its readers.	2009-09	Simon + Schuster UK						ZZZ000000

There is a vacuum of leadership in many of our major institutions: government, education, business, religion, the arts. This crisis has arisen in part because many of those institutions have been reinvented with the technological revolution we are experiencing.

But in the midst of this technological boom, people are becoming isolated from each other.

Now Meredith has revisited and significantly updated his biography to incorporate a decade of additional perspective and hindsight on the man and his legacy and to examine how far his hopes for the new South Africa have been realised. Published as South Africa celebrates 100 years since its founding and hosts the 2010 World Cup, Nelson Mandela is the most thorough and up-to-date account available of the life of its most revered hero.	2010	Simon & Schuster, Limited						ZZZ000000
9781847378989	Spoken from the Heart	Laura Bush		In a captivating and compelling voice that ranks with many of our greatest memoirists, Laura Bush tells the story of her unique path from dusty Midland, Texas to the world stage and the White House. An only child, Laura Welch grew up in a family that lost three babies to miscarriage or infant death. She masterfully recreates the rugged, oil boom-and-bust culture of Midland, her close relationship with her father, and the bonds of early friendships that she retains to this day. After graduating, she became an elementary school teacher and, at the age of thirty, she met George W. Bush, whom she had last passed in the hallway in seventh grade. Three months later, 'the old maid of Midland married Midland's most eligible bachelor'. As First Lady of Texas, Laura Bush captures presidential life in the frantic and fearful months after 9-11, when fighter jet cover echoed through the walls. She writes openly about the threats, the withering media spotlight, and the transformation of her role. One of the first U.S. officials to visit war-torn Afghanistan, she reached out to disease-stricken African nations and tirelessly advocated for women in the Middle East and dissidents in Burma. Laura Bush's compassion, her grace, and her uncommon willingness to bare her heart make this story deeply revelatory, beautifully rendered, and unlike any other First Lady's memoir ever written.	2010	Simon & Schuster, Limited						ZZZ000000

The scandal that followed left her exiled from America, ostracized from Hollywood, vilified by the press and separated from her young daughter. \par In the words of those who were involved, Chandler describes Bergman's life before, during and after the scandal. Among those Chandler spoke with were Alfred Hitchcock, George Cukor, Cary Grant and Greta Garbo. She also spoke with Roberto Rossellini, their twin daughters, Isabella and Isotta Ingrid, Rossellini's son Renzo, Ingrid's daughter Pia Lindstrom and others who knew Ingrid well. This extraordinary access makes INGRID: A PERSONAL BIOGRAPHY the most perceptive and revealing book ever written about the charismatic Hollywood legend. \par }	2008-03-03	POCKET BOOKS						ZZZ000000

John Gribbin and Michael White examine both the scientist and the science, putting one firmly in the context of the other. Thus they bring us a revealing portrait of a man plagued by illness and personal tragedy, who was nonetheless driven throughout his life to pursue his scientific goals. At the same time they lucidly explain the enormous impact of his thinking on natural selecton and evolution, bringing the reader up to date in terms of how Darwinism has shaped modern scientific thought.	2009-02-02	Simon & Schuster, Limited						BIO015000
9781847391537	Egonomics,What Makes Ego Our Greatest Asset (or Most Expensive Liability)	Dave Marcum&Steven Smith		Backed by five years of research, David Marcum and Steven Smith's egonomics informs readers that the key to great leadership is understanding exactly what ego is - and what it should not be. With the aid of real-life examples and persuasive writing, egonomics argues that while most people believe ego is negative, it is actually a healthy, necessary element to management effectiveness and business leadership. Marcum and Smith illustrate that the distinction between a good and a great leader is how humility affects their ambition, and egonomics is full of ideas that help both upper and middle management keep their egos in balance. With a compelling combination of business and psychology expertise, these two specialists explain how (a) being too competitive can make you less competitive, (b) seeking respect and recognition dilutes effectiveness and (c) humility, curiosity and veracity are the essential components to outstanding leadership. Full of the best advice from the experts in the field, egonomics is poised to be the blockbuster business bestseller of the season.	2009-03-02	Simon & Schuster, Limited						ZZZ000000

Before meth, Sheff's son Nic was a varsity athlete, honor student, and award-winning journalist. After meth, he was a trembling wreck who stole money from his eight-year-old brother and lived on the streets.

He shows us that whatever an addict's fate, the rest of the family must care for one another too, lest they become addicted to addiction.	2009-01-05	Pocket Books						ZZZ000000

9781847393180	Human smoke,the beginnings of World War II, the end of civilization	Nicholson Baker		At a time when the West seems ever more eager to call on military aggression as a means of securing international peace, Nicholson Baker's provocative narrative exploring the political misjudgements and personal biases that gave birth to the terrifying consequences of the Second World War could not be more pertinent. With original and controversial insights brought about by meticulous research, Human Smoke re-evaluates the political turning points that led up to war, challenging some of the treasured myths we hold about how war came about and how atrocities like the Holocaust were able to happen. Baker reminds us, for instance, not to forget that it was thanks in great part to Churchill and England that Mussolini ascended to power so quickly, and that, before leading the United States against Nazi Germany, a young FDR spent much of his time lobbying for a restriction in the number of Jews admitted to Harvard. Conversely, Human Smoke also reminds us of those who had the foresight to anticipate the coming bloodshed and the courage to oppose the tide of history, as Gandhi demonstrated when he made his symbolic walk to the ocean. Praised by critics and readers alike for his gifted writing and exquisitely observant eye, Baker offers a combination of sweeping narrative history and a series of finely delineated vignettes of the individuals and moments that shaped history.	2009	Simon & Schuster						HIS027100
9781847393197	Reconciliation,Her Final Words on Islam, Democracy and the West	Benazir Bhutto		Former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, the chairperson of the Pakistan People's Party, was seen as vital to that country's future. In exile for years, in late 2007 she felt the time had come to actively re-engage and to return to the country she loved. Part of that process was a clear-eyed assessment of where Pakistan was, and of the nature of its relationship with the West, with Islam, and with extremism. In this important new book, completed just days before her assassination, Ms Bhutto demonstrats that extremism is not inherent to Islam, but that various factors, including some policies of the West, have empowered Islamic fundamentalists and are responsible for the current battle for the hearts, minds and bodies of the Umma (the Islamic nation around the world). RECONCILIATION was her compelling and convincing prescription for the country at the heart of the so-called 'clash of civilizations'. It argues that democracy, economic development, moderation and modernity are the greatest threats to international terrorism. She pledged to work with the United States and the West to ensure that Pakistan ceased to be the petri dish of international radicals, and to re-establish its bona fides as a realistic and effective moderate alternative for one billion Muslims around the world.	2008	Simon & Schuster-Uk						ZZZ000000
9781847393364	The Halo Effect,How Managers Let Themselves Be Deceived. Phil Rosenzweig	Philip M. Rosenzweig		Why do some companies prosper while others fail? Despite great amounts of research, many of the studies that claim to pin down the secret of success are based in pseudoscience. THE HALO EFFECT is the outcome of that pseudoscience, a myth that Philip Rosenzweig masterfully debunks in THE HALO EFFECT. THE HALO EFFECT highlights the tendency of experts to point to the high financial performance of a successful company and then spread its golden glow to all of the company's attributes - clear strategy, strong values, and brilliant leadership. But in fact, as Rosenzweig clearly illustrates, the experts are not just wrong, but deluded. Rosenzweig suggests a more accurate way to think about leading a company, a robust and clearheaded approach that can save any business from ultimate failure.	2008	Pocket Books						ZZZ000000
9781847393470	Never enough	Joe McGinniss		At thirty-nine, Nancy Kissel had it all: glamour, wealth and the royal lifestyle of the expatriate wife. Not to mention three young children and what a friend described as "the best marriage in the universe" to Robert Kissel, a hugely successful investment banker. But that marriage ended abruptly one November night in 2003 in the bedroom of their luxury apartment high above Hong Kong's glittering Victoria Harbour. Hong Kong prosecutors, who charged Nancy with murder, said she wanted to inherit Robert's millions and start a new life with her lover. She said she'd killed her husband in self-defence while fighting for her life against a brutal, cocaine-addicted husband. Her trial in 2005 captured attention worldwide, and less than a year after the verdict Rob's brother Andrew, a real estate tycoon facing prison for fraud and embezzlement was also found dead - tied up and stabbed in the basement of his multi-million dollar home by person or persons unknown. Never Enough is the harrowing true story of Robert and Andrew Kissel, who wanted to own the world but instead wound up murdered half a world apart; and of Nancy Kissel, a riddle wrapped inside an enigma, for whom having it all might not have been enough.	2008-11-03	Pocket						ZZZ000000
9781847393746	The Duel,Pakistan on the Flight Path of American Power	Tariq Ali		Pakistan stands on the front line of the war against terror. Yet this long-time ally of the West, whose links with the US have caused enormous friction within the country, is in deepening crisis. As President Pervez Musharraf struggles to cling to power through states of emergency, press curbs and imprisonment of his opponents, a range of forces threaten to destroy him and tip the country into a full-blown civil war. Drawing on extensive first-hand research and personal knowledge, Tariq Ali investigates both the causes and the consequences of Pakistan's rapid spiral into political chaos. Shedding new light on controversial questions (did the US greenlight the execution of President Zufikar Ali Bhutto in 1979? Is NATO negotiating to grant the Taliban a role in Afghanistan? Are those now jockeying for power any less corrupt than Musharraf's current cronies?) he examines the various disparate elements and each of the key individuals whose conflicts are tearing Pakistan apart.	2009-09-07	Simon & Schuster, Limited						ZZZ000000

9781847395269	More Sex Is Safer Sex,The Unconventional Wisdom of Economics	Steven E. Landsburg		With his long-running 'Everyday Economics' column in Slate and his popular book, The Armchair Economist, Steven Landsburg has been leading the pack of economists who are transforming their science from a drab meditation on graphs and charts into a fascinating window on human nature. Now he's back and more provocative than ever with surprises on virtually every page. In More Sex is Safer Sex, Professor Landsburg offers readers a series of stimulating discussions that all flow from one unsettling fact. Combining the rational decisions of each of us often produces an irrational result for all of us. Avoiding casual sex can actually encourage the spread of diseases. To solve population pressures, we need more people. In his tantalizing, entertaining narrative, Landsburg guides us through these shocking notions by the light of compelling logic and evidence and makes suggestions along the way: Why not charge juries if a convicted felon is exonerated? Why not let firemen keep the property they rescue? As entertaining as it is inflammatory, More Sex is Safer Sex will make readers think about their decisions in unforgettable ways -- and spark debate over much that we all take for granted.	2009-07-06	POCKET BOOKS						ZZZ000000

9781847399564	The Good Thief's Guide to Vegas	Chris Ewan		Charlie Howard - mystery writer and incorrigible thief - is in for a tough vacation in Las Vegas. Losing heavily at poker is one thing, but to find his literary agent, Victoria, being charmed by the Fifty-Fifty casino resort's star magician, Josh Masters, is another irritation entirely. Still, Charlie's not one to hold a grudge, least of all when he could be holding Masters' wallet. With access to the magician's deluxe suite now tantalizingly at hand, a spot of burglary seems to be in order and Charlie's only too happy to oblige. Problem is, everything's bigger in Sin City - including the fall-out from petty crimes - and it isn't long before Charlie and Victoria find themselves threatened with a one-way trip into the Nevada desert unless they can conjure up a small fortune in twenty-four hours. For Charlie, there's only one viable course of action: break into as many hotel rooms as he can, steal as much as possible, and just hope that Victoria can summon Lady Luck to the gaming table of her choice. Mind you, it would all be a lot easier if Charlie hadn't stumbled upon a dead woman, and if Josh Masters hadn't vanished in the middle of his act...	2010-04-29	Simon & Schuster, Limited						FIC022000

9781847734280	Tigers (New Holland)	Michael W. Richards		Just 1141 Tigers in India! Scary! This endangered species is just about becoming extinct. Save Tiger initiative needs everyone's support. The Tiger is one of the world's most iconic animals, yet it stands on the brink of tragedy. Poaching and habitat loss have so reduced tiger numbers that extinction in the wild is now a real possibility. Only in a few protected areas are they secure; one such place is Pench National Park in central India, where for the past three years a TV film crew have followed the lives of a remarkable tigress and her four cubs. This book provides a unique insight into their lives through diary extracts by cameraman Michael W. Richards. A series of twelve feature spreads by tiger expert Hashim Tyabji looks at the broader picture, at subjects such as tiger ecology and conservation, the impact of poaching and at what the future may hold for the world's increasingly beleaguered wild tigers. Published in association with the BBC, this book is illustrated by superb photography drawn from "Tiger - Spy in the Jungle", a television program made for the BBC by John Downer Productions and anticipated for transmission in spring 2008. The story of the Pench tigers offers hope that, with adequate protection, the Tiger can continue to prowl the forests of Asia in safety.	2010-01-01	New Holland						ZZZ000000
9781847920072	McMafia,Crime Without Frontiers	Misha Glenny		In this powerful and groundbreaking book, Misha Glenny takes us on a journey through the new world of international organised crime. For three years, he has been recording the stories of gun runners in Ukraine, money launderers in Dubai, drug syndicates in Canada, cyber criminals in Brazil, racketeers in Japan and many more.During his investigation of the dark side, he has spoken to countless gangsters, policemen and victims of organised crime while also exploring the ferocious consumer demand for drugs, trafficked women, illegal labour and arms across five continents. The journey begins with an appalling and inexplicable murder in England's stockbroker belt and continues with stories that are often horrifying, sometimes inspiring, usually bizarre and occasionally funny. But together they build a breathtaking picture of the shadow economy that has grown so fast that it may now account for about 20% of the world's GDP. Usually the preserve of sensationalist reporting in the tabloid press, organised crime has seeped into our lives in so many ways and often without our knowledge. This consistently riveting account unveils the nature of crime in today's world but it also offers profound insights into the pitfalls of a globalisation where the rules dividing the legal from the illegal are often far from clear. IMcMafia/I unpicks the nexus of crime, politics and money worldwide which have become entangled and interdependent in entirely novel forms since the 1980s. It argues that conventional policing methods are no longer appropriate to deal with a problem whose roots lie in global poverty and the ever widening divisions between rich and poor.	2008-04-03	Bodley Head						ZZZ000000
9781847921079	Philosophical Baby	Alison Gopnik		* For most of us, having a baby is the most profound, intense, and fascinating experience of our lives. Now scientists and philosophers are starting to appreciate babies, too. * The last decade has witnessed a revolution in our understanding of infants and young children. Scientists used to believe that babies were irrational, and that their thinking and experience were limited. Recently, they have discovered that babies learn more, create more, care more, and experience more than we could ever have imagined. And there is good reason to believe that babies are actually cleverer, more thoughtful, and even more conscious than adults. * This new science holds answers to some of the deepest and oldest questions about what it means to be human. A new baby's captivated gaze at her mother's face lays the foundations for love and morality. A toddler's unstoppable explorations of his playpen hold the key to scientific discovery. A three-year-old's wild make-believe explains how we can imagine the future, write novels, and invent new technologies. * Alison Gopnik a leading psychologist and philosopher, as well as a mother explains the groundbreaking new psychological, neuroscientific, and philosophical developments in our understanding of very young children, transforming our understanding of how babies see the world, and in turn promoting a deeper appreciation for the role of parents.	2009-08-06	BODLEY HEAD						ZZZ000000
9781847940025	The Wall Street Self-Defense Manual	Henry Blodget		A one-time top-ranked stock analyst at Merrill Lynch, Henry Blodget left Wall Street and became, like millions of ordinary Americans, a financial consumer. Confronting the bewildering array of advertising, glossy presentation books, and ever-changing investment advice offered by Wall Street and the financial media, Blodget soon realized that his former expertise was of little help in managing a personal portfolio. So, after combining his own Wall Street experience with some additional research, he formulated some basic rules of the road that can help anyone with a portfolio, a 40IK, or an IRA become a smarter investor. In an age in which pensions are disappearing and ordinary Americans are responsible for their own retirement funds, smart investing is more crucial than ever.

9781847940360	The longer long tail,how endless choice is creating unlimited demand	Chris Anderson		What happens when there is almost unlimited choice? When everything becomes available to everyone? And when the combined value of the millions of items that only sell in small quantities equals or even exceeds the value of a handful of best-sellers?

9781849830409	Building Strong Brands	David Aaker		As industries turn increasingly hostile, it is clear that strong brand-building skills are needed to survive and prosper. In David Aaker's pathbreaking book,Managing Brand Equity,managers discovered the value of a brand as a strategic asset and a company's primary source of competitive advantage. Now, in this compelling new work, Aaker uses real brand-building cases from Saturn, General Electric, Kodak, Healthy Choice, McDonald's, and others to demonstrate how strong brands have been created and managed.A common pitfall of brand strategists is to focus on brand attributes. Aaker shows how to break out of the box by considering emotional and self-expressive benefits and by introducing the brand-as-person, brand-as-organization, and brand-as-symbol perspectives. The twin concepts of brand identity (the brand image that brand strategists aspire to create or maintain) and brand position (that part of the brand identity that is to be actively communicated) play a key role in managing the "out-of-the-box" brand.A second pitfall is to ignore the fact that individual brands are part of a larger system consisting of many intertwined and overlapping brands and subbrands. Aaker shows how to manage the "brand system" to achieve clarity and synergy, to adapt to a changing environment, and to leverage brand assets into new markets and products.Aaker also addresses practical management issues, introducing a set of brand equity measures, termed the brand equity ten, to help those who measure and track brand equity across products and markets. He presents and analyzes brand-nurturing organizational forms that are responsive to the challenges of coordinated brands across markets, products, roles, and contexts. Potentially destructive organizational pressures to change a brand's identity and position are also discussed.As executives in a wide range of industries seek to prevent their products and services from becoming commodities, they are recommitting themselves to brands as a foundation of business strategy. This new work will be essential reading for the battle-ready.	2010	Simon & Schuster, Limited						ZZZ000000

9781854797483	Out of India,A Raj Childhood	Michael Foss		Born in India in 1937, Michael Foss's childhood was spent between the cold, grey austerity of Britain under threat, and the brightly lit and teeming vitality of wartime India. Here, beautifully evoked, is a childhood spent amongst grudging and unloving English relations; a sufferance of cruelly harsh schooling, a bleak, dank landscape; and a sense of permanent cold and a savage hunger even for dreadful food. All of this was suddenly changed for the sub-continent's jumble of conflicting sights and sounds and smells: the vital, stinking, hot, noisy, crowded streets; the calm, quiet grace of moghul architecture; the ancient Hindu kingdoms reduced to stones amid the roots of trees; the monumental Victorian buildings that echoed British power; the attitudes of the Raj; the self-conscious majesty and pomp. The British, the author notes, lived on but not in India. "Our rules for living were not their rules," he writes in this wry, affectionate reflection on a childhood spent between two continents, two civilizations, two versions of history.	2002	Michael O'Mara						ZZZ000000

Empires expanded and receded. Dynasties rose and retracted. India was conquered and reconquered, destroyed and disfigured. But it has remained beautiful'.

In theory, he argues, the world's wealthiest countries and supra-national institutions like the IMF, World Bank and WTO want to see all nations developing into modern industrial societies. In practice, though, those at the top are 'kicking away the ladder' to wealth that they themselves climbed. Why? Self-interest certainly plays a part. But, more often, rich and powerful governments and institutions are actually being 'Bad Samaritans': their intentions are worthy but their simplistic free-market ideology and poor understanding of history leads them to inflict policy errors on others. Chang demonstrates this by contrasting the route to success of economically vibrant countries with the very different route now being dictated to the world's poorer nations. In the course of this, he shows just how muddled the thinking is in such key areas as trade and foreign investment. He shows that the case for privatisation and against state involvement is far from proven. And he explores the ways in which attitudes to national cultures and political ideologies are obscuring clear thinking and creating bad policy. Finally, he argues the case for new strategies for a more prosperous world that may appall the 'Bad Samaritans'.	2008	Random House Business						ZZZ000000

But a stone which in the present century could be used for a terrifying new purpose.  Now rival groups are assembling their teams to hunt the idol down, at any cost.  The only clue to the idol's final resting place is to be found in a 400-year-old manuscript. Which introduces Professor William Race, a mild-mannered but brilliant young linguist who is unwillingly recruited to interpret the document that could lead to the idol itself.  So begins the mission that will lead Race and his companions to a mysterious temple hidden in the foothills of the Andes. There they find a carefully contrived sanctuary seething with menace and unexpected dangers. But it is not until the silence of the temple is breached that Race and his team discover they have broken a golden rule . . .  Some doors are meant to remain unopened.	2001-01-12	Pan						ZZZ000000

9780330487603	India,a wounded civilization	V S Naipaul		In 1964 V.S. Naipaul published An Area of Darkness , his semi-autobiographical account of a year in India. Two visits later, prompted by the Emergency of 1975, he came to write India: A Wounded Civilization , in which he casts a more analytical eye over Indian attitudes. In this work, he recapitulates and further investigates the feelings that the vast, mysterious and agonised continent has previously aroused in him. What he sees and what he hears - evoked so superbly and vividly in this book - only reinforce in him his conviction that India, wounded by a thousand years of foreign rule, has not yet found an ideology of regeneration.

The case fell to the Santa Teresa County Sheriff's Department, but the detectives had little to go on, and after months of investigation, the murder remained unsolved.  That was eighteen years ago. Now the two men who found the body, both nearing the end of long careers in law enforcement, want one last shot at the case . . . and they turn to Kinsey Millhone to help them find closure. But revisiting the past can be a dangerous business, and what begins with the pursuit of Jane Doe's real identity ends in a high-risk hunt for her killer.  Based on an unsolved homicide that occured in 1969, "Q is for Quarry" and Grafton's interest in the case have renewed police efforts. The body has been exhumed, and a facial reconstruction made that appears in the last pages of the novel.

In the years that followed, the relationship between father and son revived, then fell apart. For Aatish, their tension had not just to do with the tensions of a son rediscovering his absent father - they were intensified by the fact that Aatish was Indian, his father Pakistani and Muslim. It had complicated his parents' relationship; now it complicated his.	2009	Pan Macmillan Ltd.						ZZZ000000

9780330512381	Point Omega	Don DeLillo		In the middle of a desert 'somewhere south of nowhere', to a forlorn house made of metal and clapboard, a secret war adviser has gone in search of space and time. Richard Elster, seventy-three, was a scholar - an outsider - when he was called to a meeting with government war planners. For two years he tried to make intellectual sense of the troop deployments, counterinsurgency, orders for rendition. He was to map the reality these men were trying to create. At the end of his service, Elster retreats to the desert, where he is joined by a young filmmaker intent on documenting his experience. Jim Finley wants to make a one-take film, Elster its single character - 'Just a man against a wall.' The two men sit on the deck, drinking and talking. Finley makes the case for his film. Weeks go by. And then Elster's daughter Jessie visits - an 'otherworldly' woman from New York - who dramatically alters the dynamic of the story. When a devastating event follows, all the men's talk, the accumulated meaning of conversation and isolation, is thrown into question. What is left is loss, fierce and incomprehensible. "Point Omega" is a deeply unnerving and brilliant work from one of our greatest living writers.

9780385614801	A Really Short History of Nearly Everything	Bill Bryson		Bill's own fascination with science began with a battered old schoolbook he had when he was about ten or eleven years old in America. It had an illustration that captivated him - a cutaway diagram showing Earth's interior as it would look if you cut into it with a large knife and carefully removed about a quarter of its bulk. The idea of lots of startled cars and people falling off the edge of that sudden cliff(and 4,000 miles is a pretty long way to fall) was what grabbed him in the beginning, but gradually his attention turned to what the picture was trying to teach him - namely, that Earth's interior is made up of several different layers of materials, and at the very centre of it all is a glowing sphere of iron and nickel, which is as hot as the surface of the Sun, according to the caption. And he very clearly remembers thinking: "How do they know that?" Bill's story-telling skill makes the "How?" and, just as importantly, the "Who?" of scientific discovery entertaining and accessible for all ages. In this exciting new edition for younger readers, he covers the wonder and mysteries of time and space, the frequently bizarre and often obsessive scientists and the methods they used, the crackpot theories which held sway for far too long, the extraordinary accidental discoveries which suddenly advanced whole areas of science when the people were actually looking for something else (or in the wrong direction) and the mind-boggling fact that, somehow, the universe exists and, against all odds, life came to be on this wondrous planet we call home.	2008-10-02	Doubleday						ZZZ000000

9780099505693	Made to Stick,Why Some Ideas Take Hold and Others Come Unstuck	Chip Heath&Dan Heath		What is that makes urban myths so persistent but many everyday truths so eminently forgettable? How do newspapers set about ensuring that their headlines make you want to read on? And why do we remember complicated stories but not complicated facts? In the course of over ten years of study, Chip and Dan Heath have established what it is that determines whether particular ideas or stories stick in our minds or not, and Made to Stick is the fascinating outcome of their painstaking research. Packed full of case histories and though-provoking anecdotes, it shows, among other things, how one Australian scientist convinced the world he'd discovered the cause of stomach ulcers by drinking a glass filled with bacteria, how a gifted sports reporter got people to watch a football match by showing them the outside of the stadium, and how high-concept pitches such as 'Jaws on a spaceship' (Alien) and 'Die Hard on a bus' (Speed) convince movie executives to invest vast sums of money in a project on the basis of almost no information. Entertaining and informative by turns, this is a fascinating and multi-faceted account of a key area of human behaviour.

9780099526445	Exit Ghost	Philip Roth		Like Rip Van Winkle returning to his hometown to find that all has changed, Nathan Zuckerman comes back to New York, the city he left eleven years before. Alone on his New England mountain, Zuckerman has been nothing but a writer: no voices, no media, no terrorist threats, no women, no news, no tasks other than his work and the enduring of old age. Walking the streets like a revenant, he quickly makes three connections that explode his carefully protected solitude. One is with a young couple with whom, in a rash moment, he offers to swap homes. They will flee post-9/11 Manhattan for his country refuge, and he will return to city life. But from the time he meets them, Zuckerman also wants to swap his solitude for the erotic challenge of the young woman, Jaime, whose allure draws him back to all that he thought he had left behind: intimacy, the vibrant play of heart and body. The second connection is with a figure from Zuckerman's youth, Amy Bellette, companion and muse to Zuckerman's first literary hero, E.I. Lonoff. The once irresistible Amy is now an old woman depleted by illness, guarding the memory of that grandly austere American writer who showed Nathan the solitary path to a writing vocation. The third connection is with Lonoff's would-be biographer, a young literary hound who will do and say nearly anything to get to Lonoff's "great secret". Suddenly involved, as he never wanted or intended to be involved again, with love, mourning, desire, and animosity, Zuckerman plays out an interior drama of vivid and poignant possibilities. Haunted by Roth's earlier works the melancholy comedy of The Ghost Writer, the counterpoint of the imaginary and the real in The Counterlife, the distinctive dialogues of Deception Exit Ghost is a reminder of Roth's incomparable style and themes and an amazing leap into yet another phase in this great writer's insatiable commitment to fiction.	2008-01-01	Random House UK Ltd						ZZZ000000

Like her mother, young Sarah Carrier is bright and wilful, openly challenging the small, brutal world in which they live. In this startling novel, she narrates the story of her early life in Andover, near Salem. Her father is a farmer, English in origin, quietly stoical but with a secret history. Her mother is a herbalist, tough but loving, and above all a good mother. Often at odds with each other, Sarah and her mother have a close but also cold relationship, yet it is clear that Martha understands her daughter like no other. When Martha is accused of witchcraft, and the whisperings in the community escalate, she makes her daughter promise not to stand up for her if the case is taken to court. As Sarah and her brothers are hauled into the prison themselves, the vicious cruelty of the trials is apparent, as the Carrier family, along with other innocents, are starved and deprived of any decency, battling their way through the hysteria with the sheer willpower their mother has taught them.	2008	Macmillan						ZZZ000000

Today the challenge of radical Islam represents the greatest threat to world peace seen since the darkest days of the Cold War, and the legacy of Khomeini's Islamic Revolution lies at the heart of many of the world's most intractable conflicts. Khomeini's Ghost is the definitive biographical account of how an impoverished young student from a remote area of southern Iran came to be the political and the spiritual leader of his country. Drawing on a wide variety of Iranian sources, including religious figures who knew and worked with Khomeini both in exile and in power, Con Coughlin examines in detail the principles of Khomeini's Islamic Revolution and the impact of his legacy today, whether it is in Iran's support for radical Islamic groups or Iran's commitment to developing an atom bomb. Frighteningly topical, compellingly readable and written with authority and profound understanding of the subject, this is political biography at its best.	2009-02-20	Pan Macmillan						ZZZ000000

9780330418836	Cat O' Nine Tales	Jeffrey Archer		"A storyteller in the class of Alexander Dumas. . . Unsurpassed skill...making the reader wonder intensely what will happen next.""---The Washington Post""" "Cat o'Nine Tales" is the fifth collection of irresistible short stories from the master storyteller. Ingeniously plotted, with richly drawn characters and Jeffrey Archer's trademark of deliciously unexpected conclusions, this new collection has the added bonus of thirteen charming illustrations by the internationally acclaimed artist Ronald Searle. Some of these twelve stories were inspired by the two years Jeffrey Archer spent in prison, including the story of a company chairman who tries to poison his wife while on a trip to St. Petersburg---with unexpected consequences. "The Red King" is a tale about a con man who discovers that an English lord requires one more chess piece to complete a set that would be worth a fortune. In another tale of deception, "The Commissioner," a Bombay con artist ends up in the morgue after he uses the police chief as bait in his latest scam. "The Perfect Murder" reveals how a convict manages to remove an old enemy while he's locked up in jail, and then set up two prison officers as his alibi. In "Charity Begins at Home," an accountant realizes he has achieved nothing in his life, and sets out to make a fortune before he retires. And then there is Archer's favorite, "In the Eye of the Beholder," in which a handsome star athlete falls in love with a three-hundred-pound woman . . . who happens to be the ninth-richest woman in Italy. Jeffrey Archer is the only author to have topped international bestseller lists with his fiction, nonfiction, and short stories. "Cat o'Nine Tales" is Archer at his best: witty, poignant, sad, surprising, and unforgettable.	2007	Pan Books						ZZZ000000

9780330432894	Flat Earth	Christine Garwood		Contrary to popular belief, fostered in countless school classrooms the world over, Christopher Columbus did not discover that the world was round. The idea of the world as a sphere had been widely accepted in scientific, philosophical, and even religious circles from as early as the fourth century BC. Bizarrely, it was not until the supposedly more rational nineteenth century that the notion that the world might actually be flat really took hold. Even more bizarrely, it persists to this day. Based on a range of original sources, Garwoods history of flat-earth beliefsfrom the Babylonians to the present dayraises issues central to the history and philosophy of science, its relationship with religion, and the making of human knowledge about the natural world. Flat Earth is the first definitive study of one of historys most notorious and persistent ideas, and evokes all the intellectual, philosophical, and spiritual turmoil of the modern age.	2008-04-18	Pan Macmillan						ZZZ000000

Now seventy, he has had his second massive stroke. His young third wife Lia believes that somewhere deep inside his mind is still alive, but Alex's ex-wife and son, Toinette and Sean, have come to this remote place to help him die.  Scarlet four o'clock, terminal sedation, night blooming cereus, respiratory depression, sacred datura, persistent vegetative state, love-lies-bleeding, life long devotion: the names of desert flowers and the language of death are equally potent and mysterious in this haunting and urgent play. Like "Wit" and "Whose Life Is It Anyway?," " Love-Lies-Bleeding" explores the perilous question of when life ends--or should. It is also a play about a son looking for the father who abandoned him, and it is about the odd emotional tenacity of relationships long-ended, about shared language as the antidote to loss.

Someone older, patient and wise, who understood you when you were young and searching, helped you see the world as a more profound place, gave you sound advice to help you make your way through it. For Mitch Albom, that person was Morrie Schwartz, his college professor from nearly twenty years ago. Maybe, like Mitch, you lost track of this mentor as you made your way, and the insights faded, and the world seemed colder. Wouldn't you like to see that person again, ask the bigger questions that still haunt you, receive wisdom for your busy life today the way you once did when you were younger? Mitch Albom had that second chance. He rediscovered Morrie in the last months of the older man's life. Knowing he was dying, Morrie visited with Mitch in his study every Tuesday, just as they used to back in college. Their rekindled relationship turned into one final "class": lessons in how to live. "Tuesdays with Morrie is a magical chronicle of their time together, through which Mitch shares Morrie's lasting gift with the world. "From the Hardcover edition.	1999-07	Doubleday						ZZZ000000
9780385611671	Mutiny on the Bounty,A Novel of the "Bounty"	John Boyne		December 23, 1787, Portsmouth. A 14-year-old boy, John Jacob Turnstile, has got into trouble with the police on one too many occasions and is on his way to prison when an offer is put to him - a ship has been refitted over the last few months and is about to set sail with an important mission. The boy who was expected to serve as the captain's personal valet has been injured and a replacement must be found immediately. The deal is struck and he finds himself onboard, meeting the captain, just as the ship sets sail. The ship is HMS Bounty, the captain is William Bligh, and their destination is Tahiti. Mutiny on the Bounty is the first novel to explore all the events relating to the Bounty's voyage, from their long journey across the ocean to their adventures on the island of Tahiti and the subsequent 48 day expedition towards Timor. A vivid recreation of the famous mutiny, the story is packed with humour, violence and historical detail, while presenting a very different portrait of Captain Bligh and Mr Christian than has ever been shown before. A brick of a book - well researched, accessible and a brilliant read. Told from the point of view of a 14 year old boy and the naivety that comes with that, this has more similarities with Boy in Striped Pyjamas than one would expect despite the fact that it is written for the adult market. John spoke of this when at last year's Storylines Festival, so fans will be awaiting it eagerly.	2008-05-05	Doubleday						ZZZ000000

Along the way he describes the colors, characters, and the passion of Morocco, and comes to understand why it is such an enchanting land. From master masons who labor only at night to Sufi wise men who write for soap operas, and Tuareg guides afflicted by reality TV,In Arabian Nightstakes us on an unforgettable journey, shining a light on facets of a society that are normally left in darkness.

9780385615211	The Genesis Enigma	Andrew Parker		Why is the Bible s creation story written as it is? The first page of Genesis features no humans at all. The substance of heaven and earth and Earth s earliest creatures arise spontaneously at God s command. Light is mentioned twice, once in let there be light and secondly in let there be lights . . . to divide the day from night . Whales appear before birds. Vegetation appears after let there be light , but before day is separated from night. Any study of the Bible will show that the rest of the Bible is written with exacting care, through prolonged, meticulous narratives of human adventure. Yet the description of the creation as it appears in the Bible makes no sense. Could it be that the creation story in Genesis was written as it was, complete with its seemingly odd order, because that is in fact the correct order of events at the beginning of the world? Modern science has more than ever before revealed, in stunning detail, how the world and all of the life on it came into being. Does modern science while agreeing with Darwinian evolution, the big bang theory and the complexity and deep age of the universe prove the order of events as described in the Bible to be true? In engrossing detail, respected scientist Andrew Parker brings the latest discoveries of science to bear on this controversial and contentious question.	2009	Transworld Publishers Limited						ZZZ000000

9780552773911	Blind Faith	Ben Elton		As Trafford Sewell struggles to work through the usual crowds of commuters, he is confronted by the intimidating figure of his priest, full of accusatory questions. Why has Trafford not been streaming his every moment of sexual intimacy onto the community website like everybody else? Does he think he's different or special in some way? Better than his fellow man and woman? Does he have something to hide? Imagine a world where everyone knows everything about everybody. Where what a person "feels" and "truly believes" is protected under the law, while what is rational, even provable, is condemned as heresy. A world where to question ignorance and intolerance is to commit a crime against Faith. Ben Elton's dark, savagely comic novel imagines a post-apocalyptic society where religious intolerance combines with a confessional sex obsessed, self-centric culture to create a world where nakedness is modesty, ignorance is wisdom, and privacy is a dangerous perversion. A chilling vision of what's to come, or something rather close to what we call reality?	2008	Transworld Publishers						ZZZ000000

9780552997027	A walk in the woods	Bill Bryson		The Appalachian Trail covers 14 states, and over 2,000 miles. It stretches along the East Coast of the United States, from Maine in the north to Georgia in the south. It is famous for being the longest continuous footpath in the world. (Compare this with the Pennine Way, which is a mere 250 miles long.) It snakes through some of the wildest and most spectacular landscapes in America, as well as through some of its most poverty-stricken and primitive backwoods areas - Redneck country - Moonshine, Lil' Abner, there's bears in them thar hills. Remember the film Deliverance? God only knows what possessed Bill Bryson, a reluctant adventurer if ever there was one, to undertake this gruelling hike. Perhaps it was just a long-held ambition to lose weight: he has lost two stone so far. As he recently wrote from the trail to his publisher: 'Speaking of vigorous exercise, boy have I just had some. Maine was a bitch. I want you to come back and walk it with me so that when you die if you go to hell you will be able to say: "Call this hell? Try walking across Maine in August."' Reared in the tradition of Mark Twain, James Thurber and S.J. Perelman, Bryson used his many years in Britain to soak up a peculiarly English sense of irony and humour and to hone a laugh-out-loud style that is uniquely, hilariously, his own.	1998	Black Swan						ZZZ000000

9780553816945	Desert Royal	Jean P. Sasson		Reissue of the third gripping instalment of Princess Sultana's 'life behind the veil' revelations by the author of the bestselling Princess and Daughters of Arabia. Readers of Princess Sultana's extraordinary autobiography, Princess, were gripped by her powerful indictment of women's lives within the royal family of Saudi Arabia. In Desert Royal she continues her story at a period of crisis in her life when she reveals her shameful secret - especially so in a Muslim country where alcohol is forbidden - that she has a drinking problem. The forced marriage of her niece to a cruel and depraved older man, and her discovery of the harem of sex slaves kept by another cousin, makes her more determined than ever to defend the rights of women in her country. Her cause is given an extra sense of urgency against the backdrop of increased dissent against the Al Sa'uds, and the looming spectre of Islamic Fundamentalism.	2004-01-10	Bantam						ZZZ000000

9780553817423	Hidden Power of Dreams,A Guide to Understanding Their Meaning	Robin Royston		Have you ever woken suddenly from a vivid or terrifying dream, uncertain where the dream ends and reality begins? Since the publication of Freud's The Interpretation of Dreams in 1900, there have been enormous scientific advances in our understanding of the nature of the mind. Yet there is still no agreement on one key question: why do we dream? In The Hidden Power of Dreams Dr Robin Royston challenges our most fundamental ideas about dreams and what they are trying to tell us. Increasingly, in this age of spiritual poverty people are searching for a more rewarding, imaginative way of life. Instinctively, we know that we can influence our world and improve our own lives. So how can dreams help? As Dr Royston draws on the real-life experiences of people who have had unusual and disturbing dreams, he describes how, when we dream, we slip into a hidden world where nature takes control and where the dream, not the dreamer, holds the key to understanding. With information no longer 'filtered' or viewed critically, the brain freewheels in neutral, spinning pictures around problems in an attempt to solve them. Dr Royston also shows us how to approach decoding our dreams, and explores how our inner mind can unlock our creative depths. Whether mildly engaging or horrifically disturbing, if interpreted accurately, our dreams can help us to solve complex problems and reassure or, equally importantly, warn us. Life will always be unpredictable, and forewarned is forearmed. Dreams may even have the power to offer clues to illness and, in exceptional cases, save lives.	2007-04-02	Transworld Publishers Limited						ZZZ000000

As a favour to a colleague, Dr David Hunter is on the remote Hebridean island of Runa to inspect a grisly discovery. He's familiar with death in all its guises but is shocked by what he finds: a body, incinerated but for the feet and a single hand. It appears to be a textbook case of spontaneous human combustion. The local police are certain it's an accidental death, but Hunter is not convinced. Examining the scorched remains, he finds evidence that this was no accident; this was murder. And as the isolated community considers the enormity of Hunter's findings, a catastrophic storm hits the island. The power goes down, communication with the outside world ceases...and the killing begins in earnest.	2008-04-21	Bantam Books						ZZZ000000

9780684843131	Angela's Ashes	Frank McCourt		"When I look back on my childhood I wonder how I managed to survive at all. It was, of course, a miserable childhood: the happy childhood is hardly worth your while. Worse than the ordinary miserable childhood is the miserable Irish childhood, and worse yet is the miserable Irish Catholic childhood." So begins the luminous memoir of Frank McCourt, born in Depression-era Brooklyn to recent Irish immigrants and raised in the slums of Limerick, Ireland. Frank's mother, Angela, has no money to feed the children since Frank's father, Malachy, rarely works, and when he does he drinks his wages. Yet Malachy-- exasperating, irresponsible and beguiling-- does nurture in Frank an appetite for the one thing he can provide: a story. Frank lives for his father's tales of Cuchulain, who saved Ireland, and of the Angel on the Seventh Step, who brings his mother babies. Perhaps it is story that accounts for Frank's survival. Wearing rags for diapers, begging a pig's head for Christmas dinner and gathering coal from the roadside to light a fire, Frank endures poverty, near-starvation and the casual cruelty of relatives and neighbors--yet lives to tell his tale with eloquence, exuberance and remarkable forgiveness. Angela's Ashes, imbued on every page with Frank McCourt's astounding humor and compassion, is a glorious book that bears all the marks of a classic.	1997	Simon & Schuster						ZZZ000000

Will the caffeine in coffee cross into my baby's bloodstream? I'm entering my second trimester, and I'm losing weight, not gaining help! Is all sushi off limits? How do I get enough calcium if I'm lactose intolerant? I keep dreaming about a hot fudge sundae can I indulge? (The answer is yes!)	2006-01-03	Simon & Schuster, Limited						HEA041000
9780743285391	The Lost Battles,Leonardo, Michelangelo and the Artistic Duel That Defined the Renaissance	Jonathan Jones		Michelangelo and Leonardo lived five centuries ago, but their works still obsess our culture, with a popular and universal quality that nothing else matches. They have been equally revered and famous since their lifetimes, but our admiration for them exists mostly in isolation of each other. But in 1504 they competed with each other directly, to paint the walls of a room in Florence's Palazzo Vecchio. It is remarkable enough that the same city had produced two such geniuses in the same century -- let alone that they met and exhibited together. But this competition, perhaps the most important event in the history of Renaissance art, the moment at which individual style came to command its own value, has been largely forgotten because the rival works did not survive. This great artistic clash, Jonathan Jones argues in this riveting account, marks the true beginning of the High Renaissance. Re-creating sixteenth-century Florence with astonishing verve and aplomb, THE LOST BATTLES not only sheds new light on the making of the modern world but, in its portrait of two cultural titans going toe to toe, rewires our understanding of the personalities of the Renaissance's greatest icons.	2010-04-06	Simon & Schuster						ZZZ000000

9780743403863	The measure of a man,a memoir	Sidney Poitier		In this beautifully written, candid memoir, legendary actor Sidney Poitier reveals the spiritual depth, passion and intellectual fervour that has driven his remarkable life. Poitier credits his childhood of poverty on idyllic Cat Island in the Bahamas for equipping him with the unflinching sense of self-worth, family values and simple ethics that he has never since surrendered and that have dramatically shaped his world. Just a few years after his introduction to indoor plumbing and the automobile, Poitier broke countless barriers to launch a pioneering career portraying important, dignified characters in some of the most morally significant films of the late 20th century. His engaging memoir spans a time in American history from segregation, through the early Civil Rights conflicts, to present-day cultural struggles. Poitier shares his provocative thoughts on racism in Hollywood, consumerism and the media, illness and mortality, honouring a higher consciousness and paying the price for artistic integrity. This book is a powerful testament to the rewards of being true to one's self, acting passionately on one's convictions and boldly walking on the edge.	2001-06-04	Pocket Books						ZZZ000000

James Kynge shows not only the extraordinary rise of the Chinese economy, but what the future holds as China begins to influence the world.On the eve of the British industrial revolution some 230 years ago, China accounted for one third of the global economy. In 1979, after 30 years of Communism, its economy contributed only two per cent to global GDP. Now it is back up to five per cent, and rising. Although China is already a palpable force in the world, its re-emergence is only just starting to be felt. Over the next decade the hunger for foreign jobs, raw materials, energy and food will reshape world trade, capital flows and politics.Kynge shows China's weaknesses - its environmental polution, its crisis in social trust, its weak financial system and the faltering institutions of its governments - which are poised to have disruptive effects on the world. The fall-out from any failure in China's rush to modernity or simply from a temporary economic crash in the Chinese economy would be felt around the world.	2006-12-27	Orion Publishing Group, Limited						ZZZ000000

In this book he marshalls a wide range of powerful evidence from business research and psychology that shows that the current model of work -- in which people are treated essentially as machines that should be able to perform at top speed for extraordinarily long hours, be able to multi-task, be always accessible and online, withstand often harsh and emotionally punishing treatment, and be primarily driven by the need to make profits -- is not only not optimal, it is specfically counter-productive because it saps us of our physical, emotional, mental and spiritual energy. In order for us to perform at our best, we must make a set of key changes in our work lives -- and in order to develop the full potential of their work force, our managers and companies must institute changes that will provide us with the regular physical renewal, emotional reward, mental focus and stimulation; and sense of purpose and significance that we need.	2010	Simon & Schuster, Limited						ZZZ000000

9781405054621	Amis & son,two literary generations	Neil Powell		Two of the most successful British novelists of the last fifty years, Kingsley and Martin Amis are both known for their savage wit and their indifference to causing controversy.  In his critical biography, Neil Powell looks at the careers of these two very divisive, and hugely talented writers: how they were formed by their upbringings, developed as writers and in turn how they affected literature, and each other. He examines how success (which is the title one of Martin Amis's novels) affected their relationship, and themselves as writers (Kingsley: "Martin's spending a year abroad for tax purposes. 29, he is. Little shit."). Through this we see what it has meant to be a man, and a writer, (and, most importantly, a comic writer) in Britain over the last sixty years, following Kinglsey from jazz-loving iconoclast to Thatcher-loving Tory and Martin from wild young man of letters to God knows what.	2008	Macmillan						ZZZ000000

9781416502968	The One Thing You Need to Know,...About Great Managing, Great Leading, and Sustained Individual Success	Marcus Buckingham		Drawing on a wide body of research, including extensive in-depth interviews, THE ONE THING YOU NEED TO KNOW reveals the central insights that lie at the core of: Great Managing, Great Leadership and Great Careers. Buckingham uses a wealth of relevant examples to reveal that at the heart of each insight lies a controlling insight. Lose sight of this 'one thing' and all of your best efforts at managing, leading, or individual achievement will be diminished. For great managing, the controlling insight has less to do with fairness, or team building, or clear expectations (although all are important). Rather, the one thing great managers know is the need to discover and then capitalize on what is unique about each person. For leadership, the controlling insight is the opposite - discover and capitalize on what is universal to all your people, regardless of differences in personality, race, sex, or age. For sustained individual success, the controlling insight is the need to discover what you don't like doing, and know how and when to stop doing it. In every way a groundbreaking work, THE ONE THING YOU NEED TO KNOW offers crucial performance and career lessons for business people at every level.	2006-10-31	Pocket Books						ZZZ000000

Exploring all aspects of his life and career, CHURCHILL AND THE JEWS sheds new light on a key figure of the twentieth century and how his attitudes affected not just the prosecution of the Second World War but the establishment of a Jewish state that followed it.	2008-04-07	Pocket Books						ZZZ000000

9781416532187	The pirate's dilemma,how youth culture is reinventing capitalism	Matt James Mason		It started with punk. Hip-hop, rave, graffiti, and gaming took it to another level, and now modern technology has made the ideas and innovations of youth culture increasingly intimate and increasingly global at the same time.In The Pirate's Dilemma, VICE magazine's Matt Mason -- poised to become the Malcolm Gladwell of the iPod Generation -- brings the exuberance of a passionate music fan and the technological savvy of an IT wizard to the task of sorting through the changes brought about by the interface of pop culture and innovation. He charts the rise of various youth movements -- from pirate radio to remix culture -- and tracks their ripple effect throughout larger society. Mason brings a passion and a breadth of intelligence to questions such as the following: How did a male model who messed with disco records in the 1970s influence the way Boeing designs airplanes? Who was the nun who invented dance music, and how is her influence undermining capitalism as we know it? Did three high school kids who remixed Nazis into Smurfs in the 1980s change the future of the video game industry? Can hip-hop really bring about world peace? Each chapter crystallizes the idea behind one of these fringe movements and shows how it combined with technology to subvert old hierarchies and empower the individual.With great wit and insight -- and a cast of characters that includes such icons as the Ramones, Andy Warhol, Madonna, Russell Simmons, and 50 Cent -- Mason uncovers the trends that have transformed countercultural scenes into burgeoning global industries and movements, ultimately changing our way of life.	2008-01-08	Free Press						ZZZ000000

9781416546993	Nineteen Minutes	Jodi Picoult		Sterling is an ordinary New Hampshire town where nothing ever happens, until the day its complacency is shattered by an act of violence. Josie Cormier, the daughter of the judge sitting on the case, should be the state's best witness, but she can't remember what happened before her very own eyes - or can she? As the trial progresses, fault lines between the high school and the adult community begin to show - destroying the closest of friendships and families. 'Nineteen minutes' asks what it means to be different in our society, who has the right to judge someone else, and whether anyone is ever really who they seem to be.	2007-11-06	Simon + Schuster Inc.

9781416560371	Duma Key	Stephen King		From the Publisher: No more than a dark pencil line on a blank page. A horizon line, maybe. But also a slot for blackness to pour through. A terrible construction site accident takes Edgar Freemantle's right arm and scrambles his memory and his mind, leaving him with little but rage as he begins the ordeal of rehabilitation. A marriage that produced two lovely daughters suddenly ends, and Edgar begins to wish he hadn't survived the injuries that could have killed him. He wants out. His psychologist, Dr. Kamen, suggests a "geographic cure," a new life distant from the Twin Cities and the building business Edgar grew from scratch. And Kamen suggests something else. "Edgar, does anything make you happy?" "I used to sketch." "Take it up again. You need hedges-hedges against the night." Edgar leaves Minnesota for a rented house on Duma Key, a stunningly beautiful, eerily undeveloped splinter of the Florida coast. The sun setting into the Gulf of Mexico and the tidal rattling of shells on the beach call out to him, and Edgar draws. A visit from Ilse, the daughter he dotes on, starts his movement out of solitude. He meets a kindred spirit in Wireman, a man reluctant to reveal his own wounds, and then Elizabeth Eastlake, a sick old woman whose roots are tangled deep in Duma Key. Now Edgar paints, sometimes feverishly, his exploding talent both a wonder and a weapon. Many of his paintings have a power that cannot be controlled. When Elizabeth's past unfolds and the ghosts of her childhood begin to appear, the damage of which they are capable is truly devastating. The tenacity of love, the perils of creativity, the mysteries of memory and the nature of the supernatural-Stephen King gives us a novel as fascinating as it is gripping and terrifying.	2008-01-01	Simon + Schuster Inc.

This book isn't just the story of Patrick's fight against cancer, it's the story of a remarkable life and career. Intended as a low budget, straight-to-video production, Dirty Dancing became a cult hit and remains one of the most enduring films of the 80s. Ghost cemented Patrick as a hugely bankable star, and most recently Patrick returned to the public's adoring arms in TV's The Beast. This book will chronicle Patrick's personal life, too -- including his treatment for alcoholism following the death of his father and sister's sudden death. What remained a constant in Patrick's life was his marriage and Patrick and Lisa's love story is inspiring, honest, heartfelt and transcends the typical celebrity marriage. Lisa and Patrick have shown the world that cancer isn't just a diagnosis given to one individual, but a disease that can bring a household together or pull a family apart. Bold, honest and inspiring, Patrick Swayze's memoir is the story of a remarkable man's life and career and of his refusal to give up without a fight.	2010-05-01	Simon & Schuster, Limited						ZZZ000000
9781847399113	I, Sniper	Stephen Hunter		When four famous 1960s' radicals are gunned down, including the wife of an international media mogul, it would appear to be an open-and-shut case. A wealth of evidence ties the chief suspect, retired Marine sniper Carl Hitchcock, to the murders. Holder, until recently, of the record number of kills in Vietnam and anxious to reclaim his title, Hitchcock's subsequent suicide would seem to confirm his guilt. But FBI assistant director Nick Memphis has his doubts - and calls on former Marine Corps sniper Bob Lee Swagger to investigate. As Swagger digs deeper, it becomes clear that matters are more complicated than would initially appear. The shots were not executed with the scope of a 1972 rifle, Hitchcock's weapon of choice, but by a high-tech scope used by active Marines. But as Swagger starts to unravel the tangled web of connections surrounding the murders, he finds his own days may be numbered. Because he's about to face one of his most ruthless adversaries yet - a sniper whose keen intellect and pinpoint accuracy rivals his own. The end result will be a bloody confrontation that only one of them can survive.	2010	Simon & Schuster, Limited						ZZZ000000

9780330487078	The loss of El Dorado,a colonial history	V. S. Naipaul		"'What I had known of Trinidad as a child had seemed to me ordinary, unplanned, just there, with nothing like a past. But the past was there: in the schoolyard, below the saman tree, we stood perhaps on the site of Dominique Cert's Bel-Air estate, where in 1803 the slave commandeur or headman, out of a twisted love for his master, had tried to poison the other slaves. More haunting than this was the thought of the vanished aborigines, on whose land and among whose spirits we all lived.'"  From "Reading and Writing" by V.S. Naipaul, 2000  V.S. Naipaul has gone back more than once to the illuminations of this startling and original book. It is the most human kind of history, done with a novelist's eye. Living characters large and small are rescued from the records and set in a larger, guiding narrative - about the New World, empire, African slavery, revolution - which is never less than gripping.  There are two linked themes: the grinding down of the aborigines during the long rivalries of the foolish El Dorado quest; and then two hundred years later, in the man-made wilderness, the man-made horror of the new slave colony. The Caribbean slave plantations were thought at the time to be more brutal than the American, and this brilliantly researched book, with its accumulation of casual, awful detail, takes us as close as we can get to day-to-day life in the slave colony. Nothing gracious here, in spite of the various titles of nobility; only an opportunist, near-lawless community living on its nerves, always fearful of slave suicide or poison, of African sorcery and revolt, with the infamous Port of Spain jail, and its daily horrors (the planters paid the whipping and torture fees), always in the background, the only protection against chaos.	2001-09-01	Picador						ZZZ000000
9780330487122	The mystic masseur ; &, Miguel Street	Vidiadhar Surajprasad Naipaul		Two of V. S. Naipaul's earliest novels, already displaying his humour, endless inventiveness and imaginitive brilliance. The Mystic Masseu r tells the story of Ganesh, who at the beginning of the novel is a struggling masseur at a time when 'masseurs were ten a penny in Trinidad'. From failed primary-school teacher and masseur to author, revered mystic and MBE, his is a journey memorable for its hilarious and bewildering success. Naipaul's clarity of style, humorous touch and powerful characterization are all in evidence in this, his first book. Funny, touching and perceptive, this novel is a wonderful introduction for readers new to Naipaul's writing. Included too in this edition is another exceptional early novel, MIGUEL STREET, which won the Somerset Maugham Award on its appearance in 1959.	2002	Picador						ZZZ000000
9780330487160	An area of darkness	Vidiadhar Surajprasad Naipaul		AN AREA OF DARKNESS is V.S. Naipaul's semi-autobiographical account - at once painful and hilarious, always concerned - of his first visit to India, the land of his forbears. From the moment of his inauspicious arrival in Prohibition-dry Bombay, bearing whisky and cheap brandy, he began to experience a sense of cultural estrangement from the subcontinent. It became for him a land of myths, an area of darkness closing up behind him as he travelled . . .  The experience was not a pleasant one, but the pain the author suffered was creative rather than numbing, and engendered a masterful work of literature that is by turns tender, lyrical, explosive and cruel. With spectacular narrative skill, Naipaul provides a revelation both of India and of himself: a displaced person who paradoxically possesses a stronger sense of place than almost anyone.

9780330491396	Lenin,a biography	Robert Service		LENIN: His politics still reverberate around the world even after the end of the USSR. His name elicits revulsion and reverence. And yet Lenin the man remains largely a mystery. This biography shows us Lenin as we have never seen him, in his full complexity as revolutionary, political leader, thinker, and private person.Born Vladimir Illich Ulyanov in 1870, the son of a schools inspector and a doctor's daughter, Lenin was to become the greatest single force in the Soviet revolution -- and perhaps the most influential politician of the twentieth century. Drawing on sources only recently discovered, Robert Service explores the social, cultural, and political catalysts for Lenin's explosion into global prominence. His book gives us the vast panorama of Russia in that awesome vortex of change from tsarism's collapse to the establishment of the communist one-party state. Through the prism of Lenin's career Service focuses on dictatorship, the Marxist revolutionary dream, civil war, and inter-war European politics. And we are shown how Lenin, despite the hardships he inflicted, was widely mourned after his death in 1924.Robert Service's Lenin is a political colossus but also a believable human being. This biography stresses the importance of his supportive family and of its ethnic and cultural background. Service examines his education, upbringing, and the troubles of his early life to explain the emergence of a rebel whose devotion to destruction proved greater than his love for the 'proletariat' he supposedly served. We are enabled to see how his intellectual preoccupations and inner rage underwent volatile interaction and propelled his career from young Marxist activist to founder ofthe communist party and the Soviet state -- and how he bequeathed to Russia a legacy of political oppression and social intimidation that has yet to be expunged.	2002	Pan Books						ZZZ000000

9780385720151	Lexus and the Olive Tree	Thomas L. Friedman		From one of our most perceptive commentators and winner of the National Book Award, a comprehensive look at the new world of globalization, the international system that, more than anything else, is shaping world affairs today. As the Foreign Affairs columnist for The New York Times, Thomas L. Friedman has traveled the globe, interviewing people from all walks of contemporary life; Brazilian peasants in the Amazon rain forest, new entrepreneurs in Indonesia, Islamic students in Teheran, and the financial wizards on Wall Street and in Silicon Valley. Now Friedman has drawn on his years on the road to produce an engrossing and original look at globalization. Globalization, he argues, is not just a phenomenon and not just a passing trend. It is the international system that replaced the Cold War system; the new, well-greased, interconnected system; Globalization is the integration of capital, technology, and information across national borders, in a way that is creating a single global market and, to some degreee, a global village. Simply put, one can't possibly understand the morning news or one's own investments without some grasp of the system. Just one example - During the Cold War, we reached for the hot line between the White House and the Kremlin - a symbol that we were all divided but at least the two superpowers were in charge. In the era of globalization, we reach for the Internet - a symbol that we are all connected but nobody is totally in charge. With vivid stories and a set of original terms and concepts, Friedman offers readers remarkable access to his unique understanding of this new world order, and shows us how to see this new system. He dramatizes the conflict of 'the Lexus and the olive tree' - the tension between the globalization system and ancient forces of culture, geography, tradition, and community. He also details the powerful backlash that globalization produces among those who feel brutalized by it, and he spells out what we all need to do to keep the system in balance. Finding the proper balance between the Lexus and the olive tree is the great drama of he globalization era, and the ultimate theme of Friedman's challenging, provocative book - essential reading for all who care about how the world really works.	2000-04	Anchor Books						ZZZ000000

Nafisi s intelligent and complicated mother, disappointed in her dreams of leading an important and romantic life, created mesmerising fictions about herself, her family, and her past.But her daughter soon learned that these narratives of triumph hid as much as they revealed.Nafisi s father escaped into narratives of another kind, enchanting his children with classic tales like the Shahnameh, the Persian Book of Kings.When her father began to see other women, young Azar began to keep his secrets from her mother.Nafisi s complicity in these childhood dramas ultimately led her to resist remaining silent about other personal as well as political, cultural, and social injustices.

9780500017678	The necklace,from antiquity to the present	Amanda Triossi&Daniela Mascetti		Somewhere between jewelry and body adornment, the necklace offers perhaps the most exciting decorative possibilities of any article of personal display. What is worn around the neck cannot be ignored - unlike the more discreet charms of ear and finger decoration - and the necklace as an emblem of wealth, status and proclivity has been shaped and reshaped through the centuries by successive fashions, techniques and materials, from the Egyptian broad collar and the Celtic gold torc, to the diamond sautoirs of the 1920s and the exuberant creations of the liberated sixties. The major part of this book is devoted to the necklace in the 19th and 20th centuries, as theses are the most acessible to the potential buyer and collector.	1997	Thames and Hudson						ZZZ000000
9780500278987	Women of the Raj	Margaret MacMillan		The role of the women of the Raj was to create a replica of British society in the face of almost insuperable difficulties. Exiled to strange land, surrounded by people whose language, customs and religion were mysterious and for the most part alien, how did these women react and live - how did they adjust, if at all, to life in bungalows with teams of servants, to repeated moves and heart-breaking separations from their families, to heat, illness, loneliness and boredom, to holidays in hill-stations and the unforgettable Indian landscapes? Looking at the whole of Britain's involvement in India over three and a half centuries, but particularly the period of empire from 1850s to 1947, Margaret MacMillan provides answers to these questions - from the women's own letters and memoirs, and from novels and interviews with survivors, including her own grandmother. Complemented by a wide ranging selection of contemporary illustrations, this text vividly brings to life the experiences of these women for contemporary readers.	1996-11-01	Thames and Hudson						ZZZ000000
9780500281611	Earrings,From Antiquity to the Present	Daniela Mascetti&Amanda Triossi		Daniela Mascetti and Amanda Triossi, both experts from Sotheby's, are themselves under the spell of earrings, and their erudition does not disguise that this book is as much a romance as a fine piece of art-historical research. The authors relate how the fashion of wearing precious earrings spread from ancient Egypt to the Classical Greek and Roman worlds to Byzantium. Techniques in the cutting of gemstones and diamonds, perfected in the eighteenth century, allowed earring design to evolve towards its most stylish and glamorous, and the book covers every period and style up to the present.The great names among designers and international jewelry houses -- Cartier, Van Cleef & Arpels, Harry Winston, Bulgari -- are represented in dazzling displays of precious and semi-precious earrings. Illustrations range from Rococo flowers and long, heavy girondoles thick with diamonds and emeralds to chaste Neoclassical disks and the delicate nodding sprays of the late nineteenth century.A wide-rangingstudy that will be a rich source of inspiration and delight for collectors, designers, and fashion lovers, this is a feast for the eye and a revelation of the wonders that artistry can create.	1999-10-21	Thames & Hudson						ZZZ000000

9780500288221	Maharaja,The Spectacular Heritage of Princely India	Andrew Robinson		In the annals of world history there are few more striking tales than those of Princely India. The Maharajas became bywords for excess, for lifetimes spent in extravagant expenditure and splendour on an almost unparalleled scale. The Princes, their palaces and feudal loyalties live on, and the full gorgeous spectacle of their life-style is captured for perhaps the last time in the pages of this book. This is very much a visual story, full of dazzling colours: a story of throne rooms with gilded and painted ceilings, crystal fountains and peacocks in terraced gardens, gold and silver treasures, of weddings, celebrations and festivals, and of the Maharajas themselves and their families, in public and in private.	2009	Thames & Hudson, Limited						TRV003040

9780500512005	How to read a painting,decoding, understanding and enjoying the old masters	Patrick de Rynck		Clues to the meaning of the masterpieces of art history lie in a rich system of symbols, themes and motifs that often elude the modern eye. Without the intimate knowledge of Greek and Roman mythology, folklore and Christian theology so vivid in the minds of the artists and familiar to their public, we often miss the visual metaphors and other hints that gave contemporary meaning to a painting. Patrick de Rynck draws out attention to the significant imagery and apparently inconsequential details in paintings by Giotto, Botticelli, El Greco, Michelangelo, Rubens, Vermeer, Hogarth, Gainsborough and many more.	2004	Thames & Hudson						ZZZ000000
9780500512777	Tibetan furniture,identifying, appreciating, collecting	Chris Buckley		This is a unique time in the history of Tibetan furniture, and this is the only comprehensive book on the subject. Tibetans value their painted furniture highly, but their reverence of antiquities for their own sake is not particularly strong. As a result, antique Tibetan furniture is more highly valued outside Tibet than it is within, and it is becoming increasingly popular among Western collectors. This beautifully presented volume explains the forms and uses of Tibetan furniture, the construction and decoration of the main types, and the history of its designs. Copious photographs illustrate the range of furniture in Tibet and its exquisite decoration, both painted and carved. Although aesthetic merit is the primary criterion for inclusion, this book is far more than a simple catalogue of attractive pieces, and will be of incalculable value to all collectors and enthusiasts. Readers will learn to: identify the main types of Tibetan furniture; appreciate their origin and their uses; identify and understand the most common designs; judge the quality of the pieces; and derive increased pleasure from Tibetan furniture they have bought.	2005-11-30	Thames & Hudson						ZZZ000000

9780552996006	Notes from a small island	Bill Bryson		After Nearly Two Decades In Britain, Bill Bryson Took The Decision To Move Back To The States For A While, To Let His Kids Experience Life In Another Country, To Give His Wife The Chance To Shop Until 10 P.M. Seven Nights A Week, And, Most Of All, Because He Had Read The 3.7 Million Americans Believed That They Had Been Abducted By Aliens At One Time Or Another, And It Was Thus Clear To Him That His People Needed Him.But Before Leaving His Much-Loved Home In North Yorkshire, Bryson Insisted On Taking One Last Trip Around Britain, A Sort Of Valedictory Tour Of The Green And Kindly Island That Had So Long Been His Home. His Aim Was To Take Stock Of The Nation'S Public Face And Private Parts (As It Were), And To Analyse What Precisely It Was He Loved So Much About A Country That Had Produced Marmite, A Military Hero Whose Dying Wish Was To Be Kissed By A Fellow Named Hardy, Place Names Like Farleigh Wallop, Titsey And Shellow Bowells, People Who Said 'Mustn'T Grumble', And Gardeners' Question Time.So In Notes From A Small Island, Bryson Turns A Laconic But Affectionate Eye On His Adopted Country.

9780552997034	Down under	Bill Bryson		'It Was As If I Had Privately Discovered Life On Another Planet, Or A Parallel Universe Where Life Was At Once Recognizably Similar But Entirely Different. I Can'T Tell You How Exciting It Was. Insofar As I Had Accumulated My Expectations Of Australia At All In The Intervening Years, I Had Thought Of It As A Kind Of Alternative Southern California, A Place Of Constant Sunshine And The Cheerful Vapidity Of A Beach Lifestyle, But With A Slightly British Bent - A Sort Of Baywatch With Cricket&'Of Course, What Greeted Bill Bryson Was Something Rather Different. Australia Is A Country That Exists On A Vast Scale. It Is The World'S Sixth Largest Country And Its Largest Island. ItIs The Only Island That Is Also A Continent And The Only Continent That Is Also A Country. It Is The Driest, Flattest, Hottest, Most Desiccated, Infertile And Climatically Aggressive Of All The Inhabited Continents And Still It Teems With Life - A Large Proportion Of It Quite Deadly.In Fact, Australia Has More Things That Can Kill You In A Very Nasty Way Than Anywhere Else. This Is A Country Where Even The Fluffiest Of Caterpillars Can Lay You Out With A Toxic Nip, Where Seashells Will Not Just Sting You But Actually Sometimes Go For You. If You Are Not Stung Or Pronged To Death In Some Unexpected Manner, You May Be Fatally Chomped By Sharks Or Crocodiles, Or Carried Helplessly Out To Sea By Irresistable Currents, Or Left To Stagger To An Unhappy Death In The Baking Outback.Ignoring Such Dangers - Yet Curiously Obsessed By Them - Bill Bryson Journeyed To Australia And Promptly Fell In Love With The Country. And Who Can Blame Him? The People Are Cheerful, Extrovert, Quick-Witted And Unfailingly Obliging; Their Cities Are Safe And Clean And Nearly Always Built On Water; The Food Is Excellent; The Beer Is Cold And The Sun Nearly Always Shines. Life Doesn'T Get Much Better Than This.	2001	Black Swan						ZZZ000000

Des Moines couldn't hold him, but it did lure him back. After ten years in England he returned to the land of his youth, and drove almost 14,000 miles in search of a mythical small town called Amalgam, the kind of smiling village where the films of his youth were set. Instead he drove through a series of horrific burgs which he renamed Smellville, Fartville, Coleslaw, Dead Squaw, Coma, Doldrum. At best his search led him to anywhere, USA; a lookalike strip of gas stations, motels and hamburger outlets populated by obese and slow-witted hicks with a partiality for synthetic fibres. He found a continent that was doubly lost; lost to itself because blighted by greed, pollution, mobile homes and television; lost to him because he had become a foreigner in his own country.	1999	Black Swan						ZZZ000000

9780553574579	Beach music	Pat Conroy		Pat Conroy is without doubt America's favorite storyteller, a writer who portrays the anguished truth of the human heart and the painful secrets offamilies in richly lyrical prose and unforgettable narratives. Now, in Beach Music, he tells of the dark memories that haunt generations, in a storythat spans South Carolina and Rome and reaches back into the unutterable terrors of the Holocaust.Beach Music is about Jack McCall, an American living in Rome with his young daughter, trying to find peace after the recent trauma of his wife'ssuicide. But his solitude is disturbed by the appearance of his sister-in-law, who begs him to return home, and of two school friends asking for his help intracking down another classmate who went underground as a Vietnam protester and never resurfaced. These requests launch Jack on a journey that encompasses the past and the present in both Europe and the American South, and that leads him to shocking--and ultimately liberating--truths.Told with deep feeling and trademark Conroy humor, Beach Music is powerful and compulsively readable. It is another masterpiece in the legendarylist of classics that his body of work has already become.PAT CONROY is the author of five previous books: The Boo, The Water Is Wide, The Great Santini, The Lords of Discipline, andThe Prince of Tides, the last four of which were made into feature films.	1996	Bantam Books						ZZZ000000

But by the time they reach their destination, two of them are dead. Harry Barnett is leading a contented life in Vancouver with his wife and daughter when he is brought back to England by the death of his mother. He intends to spend just a few days sorting out her affairs when a chance meeting he will regret for the rest of his life makes him change his plans. Two old acquaintances from his National Service days track Harry down to his mother's house the last address they had for him. A lavish reunion has been organized to mark the fiftieth anniversary of their RAF days. Harry decides to go. During the war, Harry and his fellow RAF conscripts spent three months in a Scottish castle where they acted as guinea pigs in a psychological experiment. The reunion is to take place in the same castle. It will be a chance to see friends, settle old scores and lay a few ghosts to rest. The party begins on the train up to Aberdeen, until the apparent suicide of one of their number shatters the holiday atmosphere. Their arrival in Scotland seems under a cloud, and when another comrade dies soon after their arrival, Harry is gripped by a sense of foreboding. As well, the recollections of the old comrades of their time in the castle are frighteningly different, and unexplained events from 1955 still haunt them. As Harry tries to solve the mystery of what really happened fifty years ago, he uncovers an extraordinary secret that convinces him he will never leave the castle alive.

9780684842929	General Psychological Theory	Sigmund Freud		Freud's stress on the sexual aspects of man's nature was not the only reason for his unpopularity at the turn of the century. He was attacked just as severely for daring to build his science on the basis of hypotheses that were contradictory to many scientific views then current. For example, he assumed the presence of the unconscious mind - an underworld that only a few poets had hinted at - and used that very assumption to prove its existence and its powerful influence on human behavior. Freud's purpose in theorizing is, as the editor of these essays puts it, to provide 'steady points of reference from which to map journeys leading...into the jungle of emotions.' Exploration is the keynote as the reader follows Freud through clear explanations of his theories concerning the libido, narcissism, negation, mourning and melancholia, repression, dreams, paranoia, and masochism. In this volume, as in his other works, it is evident that Freud was not afraid to venture into unknown areas of the human mind and that he was superbly equipped to uncover its secrets.	1997-08-01	Touchstone						ZZZ000000

9780743205603	The rule of three,surviving and thriving in competitive markets	Jagdish N. Sheth&Rajendra Sisodia		Name any industry and more likely than not you will find that the three strongest, most efficient companies control 70 to 90 percent of the market. Here are just a few examples:McDonald's, Burger King, and Wendy'sGeneral Mills, Kellogg, and PostNike, Adidas, and ReebokBank of America, Chase Manhattan, and Banc OneAmerican, United, and Delta Merck, Johnson & Johnson, and Bristol-Myers SquibbBased on extensive studies of market forces, the distinguished business school strategists and corporate advisers Jagdish Sheth and Rajendra Sisodia show that natural competitive forces shape the vast majority of companies under "the rule of three." This stunning new concept has powerful strategic implications for businesses large and small alike.Drawing on years of research covering hundreds of industries both local and global, The Rule of Three documents the evolution of markets into two complementary sectors -- generalists, which cater to a large, mainstream group of customers; and specialists, which satisfy the needs of customers at both the high and low ends of the market. Any company caught in the middle ("the ditch") is likely to be swallowed up or destroyed. Sheth and Sisodia show how most markets resemble a shopping mall with specialty shops anchored by large stores. Drawing wisdom from these markets, The Rule of Three offers counterintuitive insights, with suggested strategies for the "Big 3" players, as well as for mid-sized companies that may want to mount a challenge and for specialists striving to flourish in the shadow of industry giants. The book explains how to recognize signs of market disruptions that can result in serious reversals and upheavals for companies caught unprepared. Such disruptions include new technologies, regulatory shifts, innovations in distribution and packaging, demographic and cultural shifts, and venture capital as well as other forms of investor funding.Years in the making and sweeping in scope, The Rule of Three provides authoritative, research-based insights into market dynamics that no business manager should be without.	2002	Simon and Schuster						ZZZ000000

"Because the ideas I had about supernatural beings came to me the same way my mathematical ideas did," came the answer. "So I took them seriously."

The inspiration for a major motion picture, Sylvia Nasar's award-winning biography is a drama about the mystery of the human mind, triumph over incredible adversity, and the healing power of love.	2001-12	Simon & Schuster						ZZZ000000

Then she tells us how we can do better.

The "stateless statesman," uninhibited by the need to temper his message to suit partisan politics, here delivers his most forceful and penetrating description of how the country that should provide a beacon for good governance around the world has lost direction - such that it believes its own rhetoric and myth-making, in defiance of the facts that will shape all our futures. Soros insists that "America must undergo a change of heart." And if we're looking for somewhere to start, he says, America had better begin by renouncing the "feel-good" misconceptions implicit in the War on Terror.	2007-03-05	Orion Publishing Group, Limited						ZZZ000000

9780857201362	Women Food and God,An Unexpected Path to Almost Everything	Geneen Roth		Millions of us are locked into an unwinnable weight game, as our self-worth is shredded with every diet failure. Combine the utter inefficacy of dieting with the lack of spiritual nourishment and we have generations of mad, ravenous self-loathing women. So says Geneen Roth, in her life-changing new book, Women, Food and God. Since her 1991 bestseller, When Food Is Love, was published, Roth has taken the sum total of her experience and combined it with spirituality and psychology to explain women's true hunger. Roth's approach to eating is that it is the same as any addiction - an activity to avoid feeling emotions. From the first page, readers will be struck by the author's intelligence, humour and sensitivity, as she traces the path of overeating from its subtle beginnings through to its logical end. Whether the drug is booze or brownies, the problem is the same: opting out of life. She powerfully urges readers to pay attention to what they truly need - which cannot be found in a supermarket. She provides seven basic guidelines for eating (the most important is to never diet) and shares reassuring, practical advice that has helped thousands of women who have attended her highly successful seminars. Truly a thinking woman's guide to eating - and an anti-diet book - women everywhere will find insights and revelations on every page.	2010	Simon & Schuster, Limited						ZZZ000000

Sumner Redstone and Rupert Murdoch are both masters of this truth--and have led Viacom and News Corporation to sustained competitive success as a result. They are as comfortable in a courtroom as they are in a boardroom. Napster founder Shawn Fanning learned the lesson too late, only after incumbent recording companies in the music business had driven him from the market. G. Richard Shell, an award-winning professor at one of the worlds leading business schools, brings the strategic insights of leaders like Gates, Ford, Redstone, and Murdoch into bold relief. Using stories drawn from both today's headlines and business historys rich treasure trove, he shows exactly how to make the rules in your market and how to defend your interests when rivals beat you to it. What kind of rules? The rules that executives negotiate into contracts, lobby into new laws, litigate into court decisions, and persuade bureaucrats to write into regulatory standards. Many managers run away from the rules, terrified of lawyers and afraid of political entanglements. The smartest executives know that the law is far too important to leave to the lawyers. They follow the example set by legally savvy corporate leaders: Learn the 10 percent of legal strategy that makes 90 percent of the difference in winning competitive battles. Shells book will completely change the way you think about: Branding. What if your competitor tries to deny you the right to use your product name, as Coke did when it launched a worldwide campaign to stop Pepsi from using the word cola? Pricing Strategy. Wal-Mart is crushing you by discounting. How about writing rules to protect your profits? Gas retailers did this to stop Wal-Mart from selling discount gas in the United States. Crown Jewel Products. A giant competitor copies your hit products, markets them as its own, and laughs at your threatened lawsuit. What is your next step? Nintendos leaders faced a situation much like this when it battled Universal Studios over Nintendos first megahit game--Donkey Kong. Rules that shape the way markets work are like the invisible electric fences that keep pets inside a yard. The businesses that write the rules can offer their products and services with relative freedom--while their rivals must stay inside the fence. Make the Rules or Your Rivals Will provides the ?rst comprehensive guide to this crucial, largely hidden aspect of corporate strategy. Someone is going to write the rules in your market. Will it be you or your competitors?	2004-04-20	Crown Business						ZZZ000000

Fishman		What will happen when China can manufacture nearly everything that the United States and Europe can, at one-third the cost? It's a ground-shaking question and, when it comes to the West's future economic health, not everyone will want to hear the answer. The burgeoning output of China's vast low-cost factories and the swelling appetite of its 1.3 billion consumers, both of which are driven by infusions of foreign capital and technological know-how, are rapidly altering global commerce. So are China's newfound freedoms, national ambitions, and growing prestige. In CHINA INC., veteran journalist and former commodities trader, Ted Fishman, shows that economics is just where the story begins. Fishman paints a vivid picture of how the mega trends radiating out of China are shaping the day-to-day lives of people everywhere. Drawing on hundreds of interviews with Chinese, European and American workers, managers, and executives, Fishman also tells how China will force all of us to make big changes in how we think about ourselves as consumers, workers, citizens, and even as parents.

From the moment it arrived on our planet in the form of ice from outer space, water has been journeying throughout the earth, acquiring knowledge, wisdom and experience as it flows. Through captivating photographs and words, Emoto takes us on this cycle of water so we, too, can experience water's secret life and learn what is has to teach us. By reconnecting to this sacred flow, we return to our source and remember the important truths that we have somehow forgotten. The problems that face us - war, environmental destruction, dependence on oil, increasing materialism - can be alleviated by a collective consciousness that joins together with a common goal of peace. Emoto believes this is possible because the water crystals show us so. When people join together near water to pray for peace, beautiful crystals form from water that once yielded only deformed crystals. Water crystals show us the very real way in which prayer can change the world. In The Secret Life of Water, Emoto elaborates on the art of photographing and analyzing water crystals. He also continues his discussion of hado: how we can align ourselves with the hado of happiness, the science behind hado, and how the healing effects of hado can be found in numerous sources, such as music, flower essences, and homeopathy. Also included are Emoto's latest water crystal photographs, comparing various common phrases, music, religions and water from around the world. Humankind needs to start listening to the voice of water. Its secret life will help you return to the natural flow of nature. There is no need to resist the flow - just move ahead knowing that you are water.	2006-01-31	Pocket						ZZZ000000

9781847370815	Death of a dissident,the poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko and the return of the KGB	Alex Goldfarb&Marina Litvinenko		The first reports seemed absurd, almost surreal. A Russian dissident, formerly an employee of the KGB and its successor, the FSB, had seemingly been poisoned in a London sushi bar. As Alexander Litvinenko's condition worsened, however, and he was transferred to hospital and placed under armed guard, the story took a sinister turn. On 23 November 2006, Litvinenko died, apparently from polonium-210 radiation poisoning. He himself, in a dramatic statement from his deathbed, accused his former employers at the Kremlin of being responsible for his murder. Who was Alexander Litvinenko? What had happened in Russia since the end of the Cold War to make his life there untenable, and even in severe jeopardy in Britain, the country that had granted him asylum? And how did he really die? The hall of mirrors that this extraordinary case opens up threatens to overwhelm rational explanation. But in his spokesman and close friend, Alex Goldfarb, and widow Marina, we have two people who know more than anyone about the real Sasha Litvinenko, and about his murder. Their riveting book sheds astonishing light not just on these strange and troubling events but also on the biggest crisis in relations with Russia since the fall of the Berlin Wall.	2007	Simon & Schuster						ZZZ000000

9781847390547	Einstein,His Life and Universe	Walter Isaacson		Einstein is the great icon of our age: The kindly refugee from oppression whose wild halo of hair, twinkling eyes, engaging humanity and extraordinary brilliance made his face a symbol and his name a synonym for genius. He was a rebel and nonconformist from boyhood days. His character, creativity and imagination were related, and they drove both his life and his science. In this marvellously clear and accessible narrative, Walter Isaacson explains how his mind worked and the mysteries of the universe that he discovered. Einstein's success came from questioning conventional wisdom and marvelling at mysteries that struck others as mundane. This led him to embrace a worldview based on respect for free spirits and free individuals. All of which helped make Einstein into a rebel but with a reverence for the harmony of nature, one with just the right blend of imagination and wisdom to transform our understanding of the universe. This new biography, the first since all of Einstein's papers have become available, is the fullest picture yet of one of the key figures of the twentieth century.	2008-01-01	Simon & Schuster, Limited						ZZZ000000

Here, for the first time, he looks back to the beginning of his career and charmingly evokes the young man he once was. Born in Texas but raised in California, Steve was seduced early by the comedy shows that played on the radio when the family travelled back and forth to visit relatives. When Disneyland opened just a couple of miles away from home, an enchanted Steve was given his first chance to learn magic and entertain an audience.

While a philosophy student at UCLA, he worked hard at local clubs honing his comedy and slowly attracting a following until he was picked up to write for TV. From here on, Steve Martin became an acclaimed comedian, packing out venues nationwide. One night, however, he noticed empty seats and realised he had 'reached the top of the rollercoaster'.

9781847394200	Creative Capitalism	Michael Kinsley		Bill Gates is not only the world's most successful capitalist; he's the world's biggest philanthropist. Gates has approached philanthropy the same way he revolutionized computer software: with a fierce ambition to change the rules of the game. That's why at last year's annual meeting of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Gates advocated a 'creative capitalism', in which big corporations should integrate doing good into their way of doing business. This controversial new idea is discussed and debated by the more than 40 contributors to this book, among them three Nobel laureates and two former U.S. cabinet secretaries. Edited by author and columnist Michael Kinsley, Creative Capitalism brings together some of the world's best minds to engage Gates's challenge. From Warren Buffet, who seconds Gates's analysis, to Lawrence Summers, who worries about the consequences of multiple corporate objectives, the essays cover a broad spectrum of opinion. Creative Capitalism is not just a book for philanthropists. It's a book that challenges the conventional wisdom about our economic system, a roadmap for the new global economy that is emerging as capitalism adapts itself once again to a changing world.	2009-12	Simon + Schuster UK						ZZZ000000

9781842430347	Skinny Legs and All	Tom Robbins		An Arab and a Jew open a restaurant together across the street from the United Nations.... It sounds like the beginning of an ethnic joke, but it's the axis around which this gutsy, fun-loving, and alarmingly provocative novel spins, in which a bean can philosophizes, a dessert spoon mystifies, a young waitress takes on the New York art world, and a rowdy redneck welder discovers the lost god of Palestine-while the illusions that obscure humanity's view of the true universe fall away, one by one, like Salome's veils. Skinny Legs and All deals with today's most sensitive issues: race, politics, marriage, art, religion, money, and lust. It weaves lyrically through what some call the "end days" of our planet. Refusing to avert its gaze from the horrors of the apocalypse, it also refuses to let the alleged end of the world spoil its mood. And its mood is defiantly upbeat. In the gloriously inventive Tom Robbins style, here are characters, phrases, stories, and ideas that dance together on the page, wild and sexy, like Salome herself.

9780330452441	Parisians,An Adventure History of Paris	Graham Robb		No-one knows a city like the people who live there - so who better to relate the history of Paris than its inhabitants through the ages? Taking us from 1750 to the new millennium, "Parisians" introduces us to some of those inhabitants: we meet spies, soldiers, scientists and alchemists; police commissioners, photographers and philosophers; adulterers, murderers, prisoners and prostitutes. We encounter political and sexual intrigues, witness real and would-be revolutions, assassination attempts and several all too successful executions; we visit underground caverns and catacombs, enjoy the view from the top of the Eiffel Tower, are there for the opening of the Metro, accompany Hitler on a flying visit to the French capital - and much more besides.  Entertaining and illuminating, and written with Graham Robb's customary attention to detail - and, indeed, the unusual - "Parisians" is both history and travel guide, yet also part memoir, part mystery. A book unlike any other, it is at once a book to read from cover to cover, to lose yourself in, to dip in and out of at leisure, and a book to return to again and again - rather like the city itself, in fact.  Praise for "The Discovery of France":  'An extraordinary journey of discovery that will delight even the most indolent armchair traveller' "Daily Telegraph"  'A superior historical guidebook for the unhurried traveller, and altogether a book to savour' "Independent"	2010	Pan Macmillan						ZZZ000000

His proposal is characteristically clear: a practical plan to eradicate world poverty' Observer Would you walk past a drowning child? This is a book that will change the way you think about giving. It shows what you can do, as an individual, about the fact that more than a billion people are living in extreme poverty. It argues for an urgent change in our culture, and it invites you to play your part. The complexities of the aid debate are well rehearsed; the phrase 'charity begins at home' is all too familiar; the sheer scale of the task is overwhelming. But Singer, who has been writing for more than three decades about how we should respond to hunger and poverty, suggests that anything other than urgent and direct action is tantamount to walking by. If enough people regularly give a small amount, he says, we can together make a significant difference. Find out about the life you can save.

Josie goes back a long way with Nell and Lisa - they've been flatmates, soul-mates, and best mates and, what now seems a lifetime ago, have all lived in London in a succession of grotty flats. Finding a photo of the three of them together on a sun-kissed beach has prompted Josie into proposing a reunion for things are different now - for a start, those glorious, multi-coloured crop tops and scant bikinis have (in her case, anyway) been exchanged for all-in-one black swimsuits and cover-all sarongs.

9780330456821	Falling Off the Edge,Globalization, World Peace and Other Lies	Alex Perry		Since the fall of the Berlin Wall, international corporations and governments have embraced the idea of a global village: a shrinking, booming world in which everyone benefits. What if that's not the case? Alex Perry, award-winning foreign correspondent, travels from the South China Sea to the highlands of Afghanistan to the Sahara to see first-hand globalization at the sharp end -- and it's not pretty. Whether it's Shenzen, China's boom city where sweatshops pay under-age workers less than $4 a day, or Bombay, where the gap between rich and poor means million-dollar apartments overlook million-people slums, or on the high seas with the pirates of southeast Asia who prey on the world's central trade artery, or South Africa, where Mandela's dream for a Rainbow Nation is being crushed by a new economic apartheid, Perry demonstrates, vividly and chillingly, that for every winner in our brave new world, there are hundreds of millions of losers. And be they Chinese army veterans, Indian Maoist rebels or the Somali branch of al Qaeda, they are all very, very angry. Falling Off the Edge is an adrenaline-charged journey through the developing world, which reveals with clarity that globalization starts wars. Far from living in a time of peace and prosperity, Perry suggests, the boom is about to go bang.	2010-03-03	Pan Macmillan						ZZZ000000
9780330456937	Out of Mao's Shadow,The Battle for China's Soul	Philip P. Pan		Philip P Pan's groundbreaking book takes us inside the dramatic battle for China's soul and into the lives of individuals struggling to come to terms with their nation's past - the turmoil and trauma of Mao's rule - and to take control of its future. Capitalism has brought prosperity and global respect to China, but the Communist government continues to resist the demands of its people for political freedom. Pan, who reported in China for the Post for seven years and speaks fluent Chinese, eluded the police and succeeded in going where few Western journalists have dared. From the rusting factories in the industrial northeast to a tabloid newsroom in the booming south, from a small-town courtroom to the plush offices of the nation's wealthiest tycoons, he tells the gripping stories of ordinary men and women fighting for political change. This is a book of individual testimonies that seeks to answer one of the most pressing questions of our age: will China become a democracy, a dictatorship, or something in between - and how will this outcome for China affect not only the lives of its population, but the rest of the world?	2008	Pan Macmillan						ZZZ000000

9780330465281	The Flying Carpet to Baghdad,One Woman's Fight for Two Orphans of War	Hala Jaber		Zahra, aged 3, and Hawra, just a few months old were the only survivors of a missile strike in Baghdad in 2003. Their parents and their five siblings all died. Unable to have children herself, Hala Jaber, an award-winning foreign correspondent, was determined to do all she could to help them. Sent to Iraq by the Sunday Timesto cover the war, the last thing she expected was to find herself trying to save two little girls who had lost everything. But what happened next tells us far more about that conflict than any news bulletin ever could. Being a Lebanese Muslim, as well as the employee of a London paper, Hala is in the privileged position of being able to straddle two very different worlds and explain one to the other, and her beautifully written and deeply moving account affords a genuinely fresh insight into the Iraq war and its terrible human cost. Praise for The Flying Carpet to Baghdad: 'I read the book in one sitting and confess I cried more than once. (...) Jaber's story doesn't tie it all up with a neat pink ribbon, but it is all the more telling and universal for that.' - TheSunday Times 'nothing I have read compares to Hala Jaber's mesmerising account of how her longing for a baby drew her into an intense, often agonising, involvement with two little Iraqi sisters orphaned by a U.S missile strike' The Daily Mail 'Far from the usual gung-ho memoirs by war correspondents, this is a heart-rending and highly personal story by an incredibly brave woman.'- Christina Lamb, author of The Africa Houseand The Sewing Circles of Herat	2010	Pan Macmillan						ZZZ000000

It tells first of an Indian servant in Washington, then of an Asian West Indian in London who is in jail for murder.

At a time of tribal conflict they have to make the long drive to the safety of their compound. In the background, the threat of violence looms.The voices in this novel are breathtakingly vivid, while the characters are portrayed with an intelligence and sensitivity that is rarely seen in contemporary writing. Dennis Potter described the book as one 'of such lucid complexity and such genuine insight, so deft and deep, that it somehow manages to agitate, charm, amuse and excuse the reader all at the same pitch of experience'. This is one of V.S. Naipaul's greatest novels, hard but full of pity.	2002	Picador						ZZZ000000

Now in exile from his native country, he has taken up residence at a quaint hotel in a London suburb, where he is writing his memoirs in an attempt to impose order on a chaotic existence. His memories lead him to recognize the cultural paradoxes and tainted fantasies of his colonial childhood and later life: his attempts to fit in at school, his short-lived marriage to an ostenatious white woman. But it is the return of Isabella and his subsequent immersion in the roiling political atmosphere of a newly self-governing nation - every kind of racial fantasy taking wing - that ultimately provide Singh with the necessary insight to discover the crux of his disillusionment.  'Ambitious and successful... Extremely perceptive' "The Times"  'The sweep of Naipaul's imagination, the brilliant fictional frame that expresses it, are in my view eithout equal today'  "New York Times Book Review"	2002-05-01	Picador						ZZZ000000

9780330492553	Empires and Barbarians,Migration, Development and the Birth of Europe	Peter Heather		Here is a fresh, provocative look at how a recognizable Europe came into being in the first millennium AD. With sharp analytic insight, Peter Heather explores the dynamics of migration and social and economic interaction that changed two vastly different worlds--the undeveloped barbarian world and the sophisticated Roman Empire--into remarkably similar societies and states.  The book's vivid narrative begins at the time of Christ, when the Mediterranean circle, newly united under the Romans, hosted a politically sophisticated, economically advanced, and culturally developed civilization--one with philosophy, banking, professional armies, literature, stunning architecture, even garbage collection. The rest of Europe, meanwhile, was home to subsistence farmers living in small groups, dominated largely by Germanic speakers. Although having some iron tools and weapons, these mostly illiterate peoples worked mainly in wood and never built in stone. The farther east one went, the simpler it became: fewer iron tools and ever less productive economies. And yet ten centuries later, from the Atlantic to the Urals, the European world had turned. Slavic speakers had largely superseded Germanic speakers in central and Eastern Europe, literacy was growing, Christianity had spread, and most fundamentally, Mediterranean supremacy was broken. The emergence of larger and stronger states in the north and east had, by the year 1000, brought patterns of human organization into much greater homogeneity across the continent. Barbarian Europe was barbarian no longer.  Bringing the whole of first millennium European history together for the first time, and challenging current arguments that migration played but a tiny role in this unfolding narrative, Empires and Barbarians views the destruction of the ancient world order in the light of modern migration and globalization patterns. The result is a compelling, nuanced, and integrated view of how the foundations of modern Europe were laid.	2010-05-01	Pan Macmillan						ZZZ000000

The piano belongs to Surgeon-Major Anthony Carroll, an enigmatic British officer, whose success at making peace in the war-torn Shan States is legendary, but whose unorthodox methods have begun to attract suspicion.  So begins the journey of the soft-spoken Edgar across Europe, the Red Sea, India, Burma, and at last into the remote highlands of the Shan States. En route he is entranced by the Doctor's letters and by the shifting cast of tale-spinners, soldiers and thieves who cross his path.

And, ultimately, whether he will ever be able to return home unchanged to the woman who awaits him there . . .  Sensuous and lyrical, rich with passion and adventure, THE PIANO TUNER is an unforgettable and haunting novel.	2004-01-02	Picador						ZZZ000000
9780330492706	A Far Country	Daniel Mason		"When they spoke of it in town, they called it simply "the city," as if it was the only city in the world . . ."  Raised in a remote village on the edge of a sugarcane plantation, Isabel was born with the gift and curse of 'seeing farther'. When drought and war grip their land, her beloved brother Isaias joins a great exodus to a teeming, labyrinthine city in the south.  Soon the fourteen-year-old Isabel follows, forsaking the only home she's ever known, her sole consolation the thought of being with her brother again. But when she arrives, she discovers that Isaias has disappeared. Weeks and then months pass, until one day, armed only with her unshakeable hope, Isabel descends into the chaos of the city to find him.  Told with extraordinary empathy, richly evocative, the story of Isabel's quest - of her dignity and determination, her deeply spiritual world - becomes a universal tale about the bonds of family and a sister's love for her brother, about being caught between two worlds, and about true heroism. A tour de force of emotional and narrative power, it is destined to become a classic.  'Mason is a superb storyteller. He inhabits Isabel's mind with fine sensitivity, and cleverly uses his imaginary setting to write of dauntless, timeless love and loyalty' "The Times"	2008-02-01	Picador						FIC045000

9780330506656	Love Letters of Great Men	Ursula Doyle		From the private papers of Mark Twain and Mozart to those of Robert Browning and Nelson, Love Letters of Great Men collects together some of the most romantic letters in history. For some of these great men, love is a 'delicious poison' (William Congreve); for others, 'a nice soft wife on a sofa with good fire, & books & music' (Charles Darwin). Love can scorch like the heat of the sun (Henry VIII), or penetrate the depths of one's heart like a cooling rain (Flaubert). Every shade of love is here, from the exquisite eloquence of Oscar Wilde and the simple devotion of Robert Browning, to the wonderfully modern misery of the Roman Pliny the Younger, losing himself in work to forget how much he misses his beloved wife, Calpurnia. Taken together, these love letters show that perhaps men haven't changed so very much over the last 2,000 years; passion, jealousy, hope and longing are all represented here - as is the simple pleasure of sending a letter to, and receiving one from, the person you love most.	2009-09-01	Pan Books						ZZZ000000

9780330509947	The Bridge,The Life and Rise of Barack Obama	David Remnick		The rise of Barack Obama is one of the great stories of this century: a defining moment in American history, and one with truly global resonance. Until now, no journalist or historian has written a book that fully investigates the circumstances and experiences of Obama's life or explores the ambition and conviction behind his journey to election. The Bridge from a writer whose gift for illuminating the historical significance of unfolding events is unsurpassed offers a portrait, at once masterly and fresh, nuanced and unexpected, of the man who was determined to become the first African-American president. Through extensive on-the-record interviews with friends and teachers, mentors and disparagers, family members and Obama himself, David Remnick allow us to see an early life coloured by absence and uncertainty: one that asked demanding questions of a rootless and literate man in search of himself, sending him firstly towards social work and then into law. Deftly setting Obama's burgeoning political career against the volatile scene in Chicago, Remnick shows us how it was that city's complex racial legacy that shaped the young politician and made his first forays into politics a source of controversy and bare-knuckle tactics: his clashes with older black politicians in the Illinois State Senate, his disastrous decision to challenge the former Black Panther Bobby Rush for Congress in 2000, the sex scandals that would decimate his more experienced opponents in the 2004 Senate race, and the story from both sides of his confrontation with his former pastor, Jeremiah Wright. In exploring the way in which Barack Obama imagined and fashioned an identity for himself against the backdrop of race in America, Remnick illuminates an American life without precedent, and reminds us that, electrifying though Obama's victory may have been, there was nothing fated about it. Interrogating both the personal and political elements of the story and, most crucially, the points at which they intersect he gives shape to a decisive period of American history, and in turn, to the way it crucially influenced, animated and motivated a gifted and complex man.	2010	Pan Macmillan						ZZZ000000
9780330510042	Absolute War,Soviet Russia in the Second World War	Chris Bellamy		From the Pan Military Classics Series comes a hugely accomplished, definitive account of one of history's most pivotal wars. Absolute War tells the story of the greatest and most terrible land-air conflict of all time: the war between Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia. There have been many individual accounts of particular moments in the vicious war between the Nazi regime and the Sovet behemoth, but none which sets out to tell the full and dreadful story of that absolute war: absolute because both sides aimed to 'exterminate the opponent, to destroy his political existence' and total because it was fought by all elements of society, not simply the armed forces, but civilians - men, women, children - too. Chris Bellamy, Profesor of Military Science at Cranfield University, is one of the wolrd's leading experts on this subject and has been working on this book for almost a decade. It benefits from his remarkable insight into strategic issues as well as exhaustive research in hitherto unopened Russian archives. It is the definitive study of what the Soviets called - and what their fifteen successor states still call - the Great Patriotic War.	2009-08-21	Pan Macmillan						ZZZ000000

9780330510950	Child of God	Cormac McCarthy		By the author of the critically acclaimed Border Trilogy, "Child of God" is a taut, chilling novel that plumbs the depths of human degradation. Lester Ballard, a violent, solitary and introverted young backwoodsman dispossessed on his ancestral land, is released from jail and allowed to haunt the hill country of East Tennessee, preying on the population with his strange lusts. McCarthy transforms commonplace brushes with humanity - in homesteads, stores and in the woods - into stunning scenes of the comic and the grotesque, and as the story hurtles toward its unforgettable conclusion, depicts the most sordid aspects of life with dignity, humour, and characteristic lyrical brilliance.  'Demands its reader's attention from the opening sentence' "Newsweek"  'A reading experience so impressive, so 'new', so clearly well made that it seems almost to defy the easy aesthetic categories . . . Accomplished in rare, spare, precise yet poetic prose' "New Republic "  'His prose, unfailingly beautiful and exact, carries us into a dreamworld of astonishing and violent revelation. It is a frightening, entrancing world, which we must finally recognize as our own' Tobias Wolff  'McCarthy is a powerful and talented writer, able to elicit compassion for his protagonist however terrible his action' "Sunday Times "	2010	Picador USA						ZZZ000000

When Billy comes back to his own home he finds himself and his world irrevocably changed. His loss of innocence has come at a price, and once again the border beckons with its desolate beauty and cruel promise.  'McCarthy writes prose as clean as a bullet cutting through the air and constructs tales as compelling as any you will read . . . They are stories about people as real as the land they ride and as disturbing as the rituals they enact' "Daily" "Telegraph"	2010	Pan Macmillan						ZZZ000000

9780330511865	Hops and Glory,One Man's Search for the Beer That Built the British Empire	Pete Brown		The original India Pale Ale was pure gold in a glass; a semi-mythical beer specially invented, in the 19th century, to travel halfway around the world, through storms and tropical sunshine, and arrive in perfect condition for a long, cold drink on an Indian verandah. But although you can still buy beers with 'IPA' on the label they are, to be frank, a pale imitation of the original. For the first time in 140 years, a keg of Burton IPA has been brewed with the original recipe for a voyage to India by canal and tall ship, around the Cape of Good Hope; and the man carrying it is the award-winning Pete Brown, Britain's best beer write. Brazilian pirates and Iranian customs officials lie ahead, but will he even make it that far, have fallen in the canal just a few miles out of Burton? And if Pete does make it to the other side of the world with 'Barry' the barrel, one question remains: what will the real IPA taste like? Weaving first-class travel writing with assured comedy, Hops and Glory is both a rollicking, raucous history of the Raj and a wonderfully entertaining, groundbreaking experiment to recreate the finest beer ever produced.	2010	Pan Macmillan						ZZZ000000

Her highly personal interpretation of Confucian thought was rapturously received, An edited transcript of the lectures sold 10,000 copies on the day it was published in book form and by September the following year the book had sold 4.2 million legal copies in China and an estimated 6 million pirated ones, remaining at the top of the Chinese bestseller lists today. Simply written, and with a view to taking the wisdom of Confucius out of the hands of the academics and the philosophers and making it accessible to the general reader, "Confucius From the Heart" gives us a contemporary Confucius, one who can teach us how to attain spiritual happiness, adjust our daily routines and find our place in modern life. Yu Dan argues that his sayings, or Analects - far from being merely interesting quotes from ancient lore, of little use in our hectic, stress-filled world. Instead, they are simple truths that can speak to each and every one of us and help us lead better, happier, calmer lives.	2010	Pan Macmillan						ZZZ000000

9780330513937	The Song House	Trezza Azzopardi		A novel about the lies we tell, the secrets we don't, and the stories that result. When Kenneth Earl advertises for someone to help him catalogue his vast collection of music, Maggie - the final candidate - is his last hope. What he doesn't know, however, is that this isn't the first time that Maggie has been to Earl House, and it's no coincidence that she applied for the job. As a child, Maggie and her mother lived near the river that runs past the house. Maggie's memories of that time are patchy, like pieces from a jigsaw puzzle that don't quite fit: she remembers Kenneth's son, William; a boat; a dog; she remembers children singing, and being alone, afraid. She remembers - afterwards - returning home, mute, refusing to speak. For her, going back to Earl House as an adult offers the chance to fill in the gaps and finally, perhaps, lay the ghosts of her childhood: for her, as for William, this is her chance to reclaim her past. Written in clear, ringing prose, THE SONG HOUSE is about language and music, memory and place, about who we are and the narratives we weave about the events of our lives. Beautiful and haunting, its cadences, themes and characters will resonate with the reader long after the final page is finished.	2010	Pan Macmillan						ZZZ000000

For some of these great men, love is a 'delicious poison' (William Congreve); for others, 'a nice soft wife on a sofa with good fire, & books & music' (Charles Darwin).

What of the secret hopes and lives of some of the greatest women in history? Taken together, these love letters show that perhaps little has changed over the last 2,000 years. Passion, jealousy, hope and longing are all represented here - as is the simple pleasure of sending a letter to, and receiving one from, the person you love most. Includes letters by: Anne Boleyn * Beethoven * Edith Wharton * Mark Twain * Mary Wordsworth * Nell Gwyn (mistress of Charles II) * Elizabeth Barrett Browning * GK Chesterton * Queen Victoria * Napoleon Bonaparte * The Empress Josephine * Mary Wollstonecraft * Amadeus Mozart * Katherine Mansfield Praise for "Love Letters of Great Men": 'The most romantic book ever' "Daily Mail" 'Inspired by the "Sex and the City" movie...

9780330517096	Imperial Bedrooms	Bret Easton Ellis		Twenty-five years on from LESS THAN ZERO, we pick up again with Clay. In 1985, Bret Easton Ellis shocked, stunned and disturbed with LESS THAN ZERO, his "extraordinarily accomplished first novel" (New Yorker), successfully chronicling the frightening consequences of unmitigated hedonism within the ranks of the ethically bereft youth of 80s Los Angeles. Now, twenty-five years later, Ellis returns to those same characters: to Clay and the band of infamous teenagers whose lives weave sporadically through his. But now, some years on, they face an even greater period of disaffection: their own middle age. Clay seems to have moved on - he's become a successful screenwriter - but when he returns from New York to Los Angeles, to help cast his new movie, he's soon drifting through a long-familiar circle. Blair, his former girlfriend, is now married to Trent, and their Beverly Hills parties attract excessive levels of fame and fortune, though for all that Trent is a powerful manager, his baser instincts remain: he's still a bisexual philanderer. Then there's Clay's childhood friend, Julian - who's now a recovering addict - and their old dealer, Rip - face-lifted beyond recognition and seemingly even more sinister than he was in his notorious past. Clay, too, struggles with his own demons after a meeting with a gorgeous actress determined to win a role in his movie. And with his life careening out of control, he's forced to come to terms with the deepest recesses of his character - and with his seemingly endless proclivity for betrayal.	2010-01-20	Macmillan Publishers Ltd						ZZZ000000

Then considered a radical rethinking of marketing basics, this bestselling book has become today's bible for marketers. Now finally available in paperback, this completely revised and updated edition--with an all-new User's Guide--takes readers step-by-step through the latest strategies needed for any business to compete, and succeed, in the Interactive Age.Most businesses follow time-honored mass-marketing rules of pitching their products to the greatest number of people. However, selling more goods to fewer people is not only more efficient but far more profitable. The One to One Future is a radically innovative business paradigm focusing on the share of customer--one customer at a time--rather than just the share of market.Authors Don Peppers and Martha Rogers reveal one to one strategies to: * Find the 20 percent--or 2 percent--of your own customers and prospects who are the most loyal and who offer the biggest opportunities for future profit;* Collaborate with each customer, one at a time, just as you now work with individual suppliers or marketing partners;* Nurture your relationships with each customer by relying on new one to one media vehicles--not just the mail, but the fax machine, the touch-tone phone, voice mail, cell phones, and interactive television.Leading-edge companies such as MCI, Lexus, Levi Strauss, and Nissan Canada, and thousands of smaller enterprises, have already adopted the one-to-one perspective. The strategies outlined in this book work just as well--often even better--for small companies, from two-person accounting firms to flower shops to furniture stores.	1997	Currency Doubleday						ZZZ000000

9780385616416	American Wife	Curtis Sittenfeld		In the year 2000, in the closest election in American history, Alice Blackwell's husband becomes president of the United States. Their time in the White House proves to be heady, tumultuous, and controversial. But it is Alice's own story - that of a kind, bookish, only child born in the 1940s Midwest who comes to inhabit a life of dizzying wealth and power - that is itself remarkable. Alice candidly describes her small-town upbringing, and the tragedy that shaped her identity; she recalls her early adulthood as a librarian, and her surprising courtship with the man who swept her off her feet; she tells of the crisis that almost ended their marriage; and she confides the privileges and difficulties of being first lady, a role that is uniquely cloistered and public, secretive and exposed. In Alice Blackwell, Curtis Sittenfeld has created her most dynamic and complex heroine yet. American Wife is not a novel about politics. It is a gorgeously written novel that weaves race, class, fate and wealth into a brilliant tapestry.

From the moment that Jim and his best friend Charlie bug the staffroom and overhear two of their teachers speaking to each other in a secret language, they know there's an adventure on its way. But what does "spudvetch" mean, and why do Mr Kidd's eyes flicker with fluorescent blue light when Charlie says it to him? Perhaps Kidd and Pearce are bank robbers talking in code. Perhaps they're spies. Perhaps they're aliens. Whatever they are, Jimbo and Charlie are determined to find out. There really is an adventure on its way.

9780434019557	The Accidental Billionaires,Sex, Money, Betrayal and the Founding of Facebook	Ben Mezrich		From the moment they met, Eduardo and Mark Zuckerberg had an intense bond. Both outsiders at Harvard, the two boys shared a geeky awkwardness - especially when it came to matters of the opposite sex. But at Harvard, social acceptance was something you had to apply for. The Final Clubs, elite societies that had groomed generations of powerful men, were at the top of the social hierarchy and acceptance into one meant instant cool. But without family money or innate charisma, Eduardo and Mark turned to their natural talents and hacked into the administration's computer system, pulled up a picture of every female student and designed a complex alogarithm named FaceSmash that allowed users to rank their 'hotness'. Within two hours 80% of Harvard's population had voted and the university's computer system crashed. Narrowly escaping expulsion, Eduardo and Mark refocused their programming into something less controversal - Facebook. It spread like a wildfire across campuses... and around the world. Suddenly, Eduardo and Mark had gained notoriety and were finally getting nods not just from their fellow students but also from Venture capitalists who threw larger and larger sums at them to buy Facebook. With that the first cracks in their friendship started to appear. Before long, what began as a simple argument erupted into an out and out war with back-stabbing and actual violence. THE ACCIDENTAL BILLIONAIRES shows, with compulsively readable verve, an American Dream polluted by sex, greed, betrayal and excess.	2009-08-06	William Heinemann						ZZZ000000

9780440226499	Love Beyond Life,The Healing Power of After-Death Communications	Joel Martin&Patricia Romanowski		Despite our cultural aversion to death, two in five Americans--over 40 million people--have experienced contact with the dead. What do these communications tell us about life here and beyond? What can these glimpses beyond the veil teach us about acceptance, love, and faith? How can they help us to resolve our grief, incorporate a loved one's death into our daily lives, and draw purpose and meaning from unspeakable tragedy?Joel Martin and Patricia Romanowski, authors of the classic, We Don't Die, here explore the power of after-death communication--deathbed visions, dream visitations, apparitions, and other phenomena--to comfort us, to strengthen us, and to create a new, life-affirming notion of what it means to grieve and to die. In the midst of life we live with death, a fact we are culturally conditioned to deny. We avoid the dying, the dead, and the bereaved at every opportunity and then wonder why we feel so alone when death touches our lives. Love Beyond Life is an invaluable resource for those who have lost someone dear, and for anyone who yearns to make sense of life's final journey.	1998-11-10	Dell						ZZZ000000

With Dietz watching her for the merest sign of her usual recklessness, Kinsey plunges into her case.

9780465012039	The mature mind,the positive power of the aging brain	Gene D. Cohen		The Golden Years are being redefined. The fastest-growing segment of the population, those beyond the age of fifty, are no longer content to simply cope with the losses of age. Mental acuity and vitality are becoming a life-long pursuit. Now, the science of the mind is catching up with the Baby Boom generation. In this landmark book, renowned psychiatrist Gene Cohen challenges the long-held belief that our brain power inevitably declines as we age, and shows that there are actually positive changes taking place in our minds. Based on the latest studies of the brain, as well as moving stories of men and women in the second half of life, The Mature Mind reveals for the first time how we can continue to grow and flourish. Cohen's groundbreaking theory-the first to elaborate on the psychology of later life-describes how the mind gives us "inner pushes" and creates new opportunities for positive change throughout adult life. He shows how we can jump-start that growth at any age and under any circumstances, fine-tuning as we go, actively building brain reserves and new possibilities. The Mature Mind offers a profoundly different and intriguing look at ourselves, challenging old assumptions, raising bold new questions, and providing exciting answers grounded in science and the realities of everyday life.	2005	Basic Books						ZZZ000000

In a stunning final chapter, Haidt addresses the grand question "How can I live a meaningful life?," offering an original answer that draws on the rich inspiration of both philosophy and science.	2006	Basic Books						ZZZ000000

9780500237809	The history of Greek vases,potters, painters and pictures	John Boardman		Greek pottery has long fascinated scholars and historians of art. It provides a continuous commentary on all other Greek arts, even sculpture, and the scenes figured on the vases can prove to be as subtle and informative as the works of Greek literature.In no other art of antiquity do we come closer to the visual experience of the ancient Greeks or share their views on life, myth, and even politics. The stylistic history of Greek vases has been demonstrated in other Thames & Hudson books by John Boardman. Here he sketches that history but goes on to explore the many other matters that make the study so fruitful.He describes the methods of making and decorating vases, the processes of identifying the artists, life in the potters' quarter in Greek towns, the way in which the wares were traded far beyond the borders of the Greek world, from Morocco to Persia, from Russia to the Sudan, and problems in making and decorating them. He shows how Greek artists exercised a style of narrative in art that was long influential in the West, and how their pictures reflected not simply on storytelling but on the politics and social order of the day. The vases' function in Greek culture and as messengers of style and subject are explained.	2001	Thames & Hudson						ZZZ000000

9780500282946	The splendour of Islamic calligraphy	Abdelkebir Khatibi&Mohammed Sijelmassi		Calligraphy, the art that combines visual image and written word, is perhaps at its most brilliant in the arts of Islam. Islamic calligraphy traditionally took its inspiration from the Muslim belief in the divine origin of Arabic writing, the medium through which the Qur'anic revelation to the Prophet Muhammad was recorded. In early Islam the use of Arabic writing is sacred, and official texts gave rise to a wonderful profusion of scripts and a calligraphic tradition that has flourished for over a thousand yearsnot only in manuscript decoration but in architecture, ceramics, and painting. With chapters on the use of calligraphy in architecture and contemporary painting, The Splendor of Islamic Calligraphy provides a comprehensive and fascinating survey of the subject from its earliest origins to the present day. It explains the geometrical and ornamental principles of calligraphy with the help of numerous line drawings, and examines the interdependence of script and page decoration.

9780500283608	Safari Style	Tim Beddow&Natasha Burns		For decades the East African savanna has attracted Europeans eager to experience life with nature at its largest - on safari. Drawing on the experience of the safari these visitors have created a compelling style of living, distinctly displayed in the architecture and interiors of the homes, safari lodges and camps they have established across the vast reaches of Africa. 'Safari Style' reveals this most appealing approach to interior design, with its emphasis on relaxed living and interest in texture and colour, its borrowing of native African patterns and architecture, and its vital interaction with nature. From treehouses to luxury camps, from thatched cottages to a moorish fantasy palace, Tim Beddow and Natasha Burns have gloriously evoked the distinctive ambience of safari style.	2002-09-02	Thames & Hudson						ZZZ000000

9780500283868	The master jewelers	Abraham Kenneth Snowman		In the mid-nineteenth century, the master jewelers of the Western world began to shed the anonymity under which artist-craftsmen had generally worked. They emerged as individual voices, discarding the bland, predictable standards of the earlier era in jewelry design in favor of evocative new creations.The renowned designers whose work is featured in this book can be instantly identified by their particular interests and discoveries. Faberge emphasized originality of design and the quality of craftsmanship, rather than the intrinsic value of the materials used. Castellani is known for his nostalgic glances back at Etruscan gold work. Lalique was irresistibly fascinated by the strange forms he adapted from nature. The searching, critical eye of a Cartier or a Boucheron lent chic to their beloved abstract patterns.In fifteen chapters written by leading experts in the field, the world of fine jewelry, encompassing its social, aesthetic, and business aspects, springs to life. The magnificent illustrations display extraordinary confections of gold, silver, and platinum, gems cut and polished in every conceivable fashion, and enamels, translucent, opaque, or as clear as stained-glass windows -- all designed and executed to enhance the allure of the people fortunate enough to wear them.	2002-09-24	Thames & Hudson						ZZZ000000

9780500284957	The rivers of the Mandala,journey into the heart of Buddhism	Simon Allix&Benoit de Vilmorin		Today's young travelers are in many ways similar to those who in previous generations also set out to explore the world, both literally and in the imagination. But there are vital differences. Travelers now, as enthused as ever by cultures other than their own, want their experiences imaginatively re-created, and their information imparted, in a way that relates to twenty-first century life back home: a noisy, raucous, digitally influenced, comic-book, mixed-media life of intense experiences thrown together without homage to tradition. In this captivating book, two young Frenchmen focus on Mount Kailash, the sacred mountain in Tibet venerated by Buddhists who look upon it as a mandala, a design representing the different stages that lead towards the Budha's awakening. Drawings in pencil, charcoal, and ink, photographs of awesome landscapes and humorous incidents alike, computer-created collages all testify to each moment of an amazing journey. Following the four great rivers, Sutlej, Brahmaputra,Indus, and,Karnali, that originate around Mount Kailash, with plentiful detours of the body (and the mind) into other countries and cultures, the authors enthuse and inform everyone.	2004-09-30	Thames & Hudson						ZZZ000000

9780500342374	The architecture of parking	Simon Henley		The first comprehensive international survey of one of the most important building types of the modern era: the parking garage. Since the invention of the car, the buildings that house them have been a source of inspiration and consternation to architects. Although many dreary car parks and garages do exist, the challenge of efficiently housing a maximum number of cars in a well-designed space has attracted a stellar array of contemporary architects. From the classic circular Marina City tower in Chicago to the Parcheggio Nuovo Salario under construction in Rome, from Frank Gehry to Rem Koolhaas to Zaha Hadid, the form and function of the parking garage have been hugely influential not only on contemporary architects but also on popular culture. This book is at once a survey of the finest examples of parking garages and a presentation of exciting and innovative design. An introduction covers the history and architectural significance of these buildings and their relevance today, and is followed by chapters that define the most influential aspects of parking design: elevations, materials, the use of light, and innovation and experimentation. Featuring detailed plans plus case studies of iconic buildings, this is an indispensable and inspirational resource for professional architects, engineers, urban planners, and developers. 300 illustrations and photographs, 150 in color.	2007-11-01	Thames & Hudson						ZZZ000000

9780552153614	Madonna,Like an Icon	Lucy O'Brien		Madonna is the biggest female pop star in the world yet there is no serious biography of her, and no biography at all by a woman. Existing books are either gossipy style manuals or rehashes of press cuttings and they all end in 2001 with Madonna's marriage to Guy Ritchie. Yet her story hardly ends there, as evinced by her two record breaking world tours since then... Lucy O'Brien's extensive and well-researched biography will look at Madonna the artist, giving detailed analysis of her music, complete with revealing interviews with musicians and producers. It will focus on her cultural impact and the way she uses cinema, photography, visual art, theatre and dance in her work. It will take an in-depth look at how - and, more to the point, why - Madonna has reinvented herself through her twenties, thirties, forties and will no doubt do so again in her fifties. It will also look at the wider context and include interviews with similarly crusading female artists like Tori Amos, Laurie Anderson, Jeanette Winterson and Tracey Emin. This will be, quite simply, the definitive Madonna biography.	2008-08-11	Corgi Books						BIO005000
9780552155144	The Lemon Tree	Sandy Tolan		In the summer of 1967, not long after the Six Day War, three young Palestinian men ventured into the town of Ramla in Israel. They were cousins, on a pilgrimage to see their childhood homes, from which they and their families had been driven out nearly twenty years earlier. One cousin had the door slammed in his face, one found that his old house had been converted into a school. But the third, Bashir, was met at the door by a young woman named Dalia, who invited him inThis poignant encounter is the starting point for the story of two families one Arab, one Jewish which spans the fraught modern history of the region. In the lemon tree his father planted in the backyard of his childhood home, Bashir sees a symbol of occupation; Dalia, who arrived in 1948 as an infant with her family, as a fugitive from Bulgaria, sees hope for a people devastated by the Holocaust. Both are inevitably swept up in the fates of their people and the stories of their lives form a microcosm of more than half a century of Israeli-Palestinian history.What began as a simple meeting between two young people grew into a dialogue lasting four decades. The Lemon Tree offers a much needed human perspective on this seemingly intractable conflict and reminds us not only of all that is at stake, but also of all that is possible.	2008-03-10	Black Swan						ZZZ000000

9780552773812	I Feel Bad about My Neck,And Other Thoughts on Being a Woman	Nora Ephron		If I said to you 'I absolutely cannot stand my neck' , you'd undoubtedly respond by saying something nice, like, 'I don't know what you're talking about.' You'd be lying, of course, but I forgive you. You can put makeup on your face and concealer under your eyes and dye on your hair, you can shoot collagen and Botox and Restylane into your wrinkles and creases, but short of surgery, there's not a damn thing you can do about a neck. Acclaimed Hollywood filmwriter and director Nora Ephron turns her sharp powers of observation back onto herself in these autobiographical essays as she examines the indignities of ageing for the Baby Boom generation. Filled with witty and biting essays like 'I Hate My Handbag', 'Blind as a Bat' and 'What I Wish I'd Known' this book offers the consolation that no matter how much your neck sags, your boobs droop, your skin wrinkles and your children don't appreciate you, someone has been there before you. Laugh-out-loud funny, irreverent and brutally honest, Nora Ephron captures the essence of what it means to be a woman growing older in a book that will strike chords of empathy, heartbreak, and hilarity with any woman who reads it.	2006	Black Swan						ZZZ000000

9780553406634	Black holes and baby universes and other essays	Stephen Hawking		Readers worldwide have come to know the work of Stephen Hawking through his phenomenal million-copy hardcover best-seller A "Brief History Of Time". Bantam is proud to present the paperback edition of Dr. Hawking's first new book since that event, a collection of fascinating and illuminating essays, and a remarkable interview broadcast by the BBC on Christmas Day, 1992. These fourteen pieces reveal Hawking variously as the scientist, the man, the concerned world citizen, and-always-the rigorous and imaginative thinker. Hawking's wit, directness of style, and absence of pomp characterize all of them, whether he is remembering his first experience at nursery school; calling for adequate education in science that will enable the public to play its part in making informed decisions on matters such as nuclear disarmament; exploring the origins or the future of the universe; or reflecting on the history of "A Brief History Of Time. Black Holes And Baby Universes" is an important work from one of the greatest minds of the twentieth century. "[Hawking] sprinkles his explanations with a wry sense of humor and a keen awareness that the sciences today delve not only into the far reaches of the cosmos, but into the Inner philosophical world as well".- "New York Times Book Review"	1994-08-09	Bantam Books						ZZZ000000

9780553817683	The Great Wall	John Man		China's Great Wall north of Beijing is one of the world's most famous sights. Millions every year climb the line of stone snaking over mountains. We all feel we know the Wall. But we are wrong. It is too big, too varied, too complex to be captured by a few images or a day-trip. Myths surround it. Many believe that the stone barrier marches across all China, that it has been in existence for over 2,000 years, and that it is the only man-made structure visible from the Moon. In fact, most of it is made of earth, and much of it is not there at all. It cannot even be seen from earth orbit, let alone the Moon. Estimates of its length vary from 1,500 to 5,000 miles. Even its name is deceptive: it is not an it, a single entity, but many walls (hence the uncertain length), built at different times. Yet behind the confusion are great simplicities. The many walls are united by two ideas -- self-protection and unity -- which go back to the First Emperor, who founded the nation in 221 BC. For 2,000 years, the Wall marked the border between China and nomadic peoples to the north and west. Mutual hostility inspired centuries of attacks, counter-attacks and Wall-building, until the northward spread of China in the 20th century made the Wall redundant. For this riveting account, John Man travelled the Wall from the far western deserts to the Pacific, exploring the grandest sections and many "wild" ones. He is the first writer to describe two unknown walls in Mongolia. He covers two millennia of history, from the country's first unification to the present day, when the Great Wall, built and rebuilt over centuries of war, has become a symbol of tranquility.

9780553818499	The Female Brain	Louann Brizendine		In this groundbreaking book, Dr Louann Brizendine describes the uniquely flexible structure of the female brain and its constant, dynamic state of change - the key difference that separates it from that of the male - and reveals how women think, what they value, how they communicate, and whom they'll love. She also reveals the neurological explanations behind why... * A woman remembers fights that a man insists never happened... * Thoughts about sex enter a woman's brain perhaps once every couple of days, but mayenter a man's brain up to once every minute... * A woman's brain goes on high alert during pregnancy and stays that way long after giving birth... * A woman over 50 is more likely to initiate divorce than a man... * Women tend to know what people are feeling, while men can't spot an emotion unless someone cries or threatens them with bodily harm! Accessible, fun and compelling, and based on more than three decades of research, The Female Brain will help women to better understand themselves - and the men in their lives.	2008-01-02	Bantam						ZZZ000000

9780553840230	Working with emotional intelligence	Daniel Goleman		The secret of success is not what they taught you in school. What matters most is not IQ, not a business school degree, not even technical know-how or years of expertise. The single most important factor in job performance and advancement is emotional intelligence. Emotional intelligence is actually a set of skills that anyone can acquire, and in this practical guide, Daniel Goleman identifies them, explains their performance, and shows how they can be fostered. For leaders, emotional intelligence is 90 percent of what sets stars apart from the mediocre. As Goleman documents, it's the essential ingredient for reaching and staying at the top of any field, even in high-tech careers. And organizations that learn to operate in emotionally intelligent ways are the companies that will remain vital and dynamic in the competitive marketplace of today-and the future. Comprehensively researched, crisply written, and packed with fascinating case histories of triumphs, disasters, and dramatic turnarounds, Working with Emotional Intelligence may be the most important business book you'll ever read. --back cover	1999	Bantam Books						ZZZ000000

9780593061695	Managing the Dragon,Building a Billion-Dollar Business in China	Jack Perkowski		After a highly successful career on Wall Street, in the early 1990s Jack Perkowski needed a new challenge. Having decided that China would be the future, he set about investigating this little-known market and the business opportunities it offered. Before long, Jack set up ASIMCO, a manufacturing business specializing in car components, which now has an annual turnover of over $500 million. In Managing the Dragon Jack provides an insider's view of China, its many peculiarities and working practices. For example, we see how China's economy and government are highly decentralized and how the country tends to operate like a series of villages spread across a vast landscape; we discover how much influence 'the Party' has on the banks, and how economic incentives at local government level causes China to create overcapacity in virtually every industry. This may explain why the country has, almost single-handedly, placed the entire world in a cost / price squeeze. Managing the Dragon is a revealing and thought-provoking memoir offering a fresh perspective on a country at the dawn of a new age. Through its colourful narrative it also tells the story of one of the most influential and pioneering entrepreneurs of today.	2008-08	Bantam Press						ZZZ000000

But in a small town in upstate New York, Pellam experiences a very different reception -- his illusionary world is shattered by a savage murder, and Pellam is suddenly center stage in an unfolding drama of violence, lust, and conspiracy, which have a stranglehold on this less-than-picture-perfect locale.	2000-09-01	Pocket Books						ZZZ000000

Should you protect the endangered owl or maintain jobs for loggers?   How do you handle questions such as these? We frequently face ethical dilemmas in our daily lives, and few have trouble with the "right vs. wrong" choices. However, the "right vs. right" dilemmas, in which neither choice is clearly or widely accepted as wrong, many times present obstacles that call for value-based decisions, and that's where we often need help.   Kidder -- the founder of the Institute for Global Ethics -- teaches us how to think for ourselves in order to resolve any ethical dilemma, from the personal to the philosophical. Unique in its approach and full of illustrative anecdotes, How Good People Make Tough Choices is an indispensable resource for arriving at sound conclusions when facing tough choices.	2003-12-04	HarperCollins						ZZZ000000

For each of them she writes a separate private book, bound in different colours and placed on a shelf.

Each family carries their own secrets. Into their world comes a young stranger, a working-class boy from the potteries, drawn by the beauty of the Museum's treasures. And in midsummer a German puppeteer arrives, bringing dark dramas. The world seems full of promise but the calm is already rocked by political differences, by Fabian arguments about class and free love , by the idealism of anarchists from Russia and Germany. The sons rebel against their parents' plans; the girls dream of independent futures, becoming doctors or fighting for the vote. This vivid, rich and moving saga is played out against the great, rippling tides of the day, taking us from the Kent marshes to Paris and Munich and the trenches of the Somme.

9780714124360	Bengali myths	T. Richard Blurton		This series of narratives from the rich tradition of Bengali story-telling will draw from the substantial Bengal collections of the British Museum, which range from the courtly to the popular, and date from the 9th century to the present day. It will demonstrate the connections of history and myth, and will features works from undivided Bengal - that is West Bengal in the Union of India, and the sovereign state of Bangladesh. The beginning of the book will focus on the powerful goddesses such as Durga, whose Puja is celebrated throughout the world wherever Bengalis are settled. Images of this event and of the goddess appear in paintings, prints and clay sculptures. Also wellknown is Kali, after whom the city of Calcultta is probably named. Her legendary paradox of blood-thirst and tenderness is clear from the turbulent oil paintings of the 20th century recluse Sachidananda Sen. Poetry and prose descriptions of her story make lively reading. Other important female deities whose exotic stories fill scroll-paintings and popular prints include the snake goddess Manasa, and the goddesses of learning, Sarasvati, and of wealth, Laxmi. Story-telling scrolls which were used for recitation enable these dramatic stories to be told. Each are different in ambience, from heroic and the adventurous to exquisitely sensuous and erotic sensibility. Gods and goddesses aren't the whole story. Scrolls used by story-telling are filled with exciting myths that cross the Hindu-Muslim divide. The most important of all the scrolls in the British Museum collection, which tells the story of the Muslim saint, Gazi, illustrates the way in which Muslim pioneers penetrated the delta and settled in the swampy, jungle-filled lands.	2006	British Museum						ZZZ000000

9780714124407	Mughal miniatures	J. M.

9780714128191	Jewellery in the Age of Queen Victoria,A Mirror to the World	Charlotte Gere&Judy Rudoe		This book rewrites the history of jewellery in the age of Victoria. The age of Victoria is taken in its widest sense to encompass jewellery made throughout Europe and America, displayed at the great international exhibitions and distributed through foreign trade, illustrated publications and a burgeoning tourist industry. Throughout, links with other disciplines will provide both the specialist and the non-specialist with the information to understand how jewellery permeated all walks and conditions of life in the 19th century. The focus of the book is on the attitudes of owners to their jewellery and the symbolic weight that it was expected to carry. Rather than concentrating on the major figures at the top end of the jewellery trade, it is oriented towards the social aspects of owning, wearing and displaying jewellery. For example, novelists used jewellery to add a moral or metaphorical dimension to a character, while jewels depicted in portraits often carried multiple messages which could be immediately decoded by the viewer. The achievements of science, the fascination with nature and the Victorian sense of humour are all embodied in jewellery. Topics discussed in depth include the importance of jewellery in the life of the Queen herself, jewellery and dress, the language of jewellery, the cult of novelty, the importance of nationalism in the revival of historical styles, and the contribution of archaeological discoveries. The volume is sumptuously illustrated with contemporary reportage, photographs and portraits as well as examples of jewellery from the British Museum and other collections.	2010-05-01	British Museum Press						ZZZ000000

She then takes us into modern sleep labs across the country, bringing the scientists to life as she interprets their intellectual breakthroughs and asks the questions that intrigue us all: Why do we remember only a fraction of our dreams? Why are dreams usually accompanied by intense emotion, such as fear or anxiety? Can we really control our dreams without waking up? Are universal dream interpretations valid? Is dreaming our way of consolidating long-term memories and filtering the day's mental detritus? Can dreams truly spark creative thought or help solve problems? Accessible and engaging, The Mind at Night shines a bright light on our nocturnal journeys, while revealing the crucial role dreams could play in penetrating the mystery of consciousness.	2004-03-02	Basic Books						ZZZ000000

9780743207379	Waiting for snow in Havana,confessions of a Cuban boyhood	Carlos M. N. Eire		Publisher's description: In 1962, at the age of eleven, Carlos Eire was one of 14,000 children airlifted out of Cuba, his parents left behind. His life until then is the subject of Waiting for Snow in Havana, a wry, heartbreaking, intoxicatingly beautiful memoir of growing up in a privileged Havana household -- and of being exiled from his own childhood by the Cuban revolution. That childhood, until his world changes, is as joyous and troubled as any other -- but with exotic differences. Lizards roam the house and grounds. Fights aren't waged with snowballs but with breadfruit. The rich are outlandishly rich, like the eight-year-old son of a sugar baron who has a real miniature race car, or the neighbor with a private animal garden, complete with tiger. All this is bathed in sunlight and shades of turquoise and tangerine: the island of Cuba, says one of the stern monks at Carlos's school, might have been the original Paradise -- and it is tempting to believe. His father is a municipal judge and an obsessive collector of art and antiques, convinced that in a past life he was Louis XVI and that his wife was Marie Antoinette. His mother looks to the future conceived on a transatlantic liner bound for Cuba from Spain, she wants her children to be modern, which means embracing all things American. His older brother electrocutes lizards. Surrounded by eccentrics, in a home crammed with portraits of Jesus that speak to him in dreams and nightmares, Carlos searches for secret proofs of the existence of God. Then, in January 1959, President Batista is suddenly gone, a cigar-smoking guerrilla named Castro has taken his place, and Christmas is canceled. The echo of firing squads is everywhere. At the Aquarium of the Revolution, sharks multiply in a swimming pool. And one by one, the author's schoolmates begin to disappear -- spirited away to the United States. Carlos will end up there himself, alone, never to see his father again. Narrated with the urgency of a confession, Waiting for Snow in Havana is both an exorcism and an ode to a paradise lost. More than that, it captures the terrible beauty of those times in our lives when we are certain we have died -- and then are somehow, miraculously, reborn.	2003-01	Scribner						ZZZ000000

9780743232227	The state of Africa,a history of fifty years of independence	Martin Meredith		Africa is forever on our TV screens, but the bad-news stories (famine, genocide, corruption) massively outweigh the good (South Africa). Ever since the process of decolonialisation began in the mid-1950s, and arguably before, the continent has appeared to be stuck in a process of irreversible decline. Constant war, improper use of natural resources and misappropriation of revenues and aid monies contribute to an impression of a continent beyond hope. How did we get here? What, if anything, is to be done? Weaving together the key stories and characters of the last fifty years into a stunningly compelling and coherent narrative, Martin Meredith has produced the definitive history of how European ideas of how to organise 10,000 different ethnic groups has led to what Tony Blair described as the 'scar on the conscience of the world'. Authoritative, provocative and consistently fascinating, this is a major book on one of the most important issues facing the West today.	2006	Free Press						ZZZ000000

9780743265713	The real Pepsi challenge,the inspirational story of breaking the color barrier in American business	Stephanie Capparell		In America's long march toward racial equality, small acts of courage by men and women whose names we don't recall have contributed mightily to our nation's struggle to achieve its own ideals. This moving book details the story of one such little-noted chapter.In the late 1940s and early 1950s, as Jackie Robinson changed the face of baseball, a group of African-American businessmen -- twelve at its peak -- changed the face of American business by being among the first black Americans to work at professional jobs in Corporate America and to target black consumers as a distinct market.The corporation was Pepsi-Cola, led by the charismatic and socially progressive Walter Mack, a visionary business leader. Though Mack was a guarded idealist, his consent for a campaign aimed at black consumers was primarily motivated by the pursuit of profits -- and the campaign succeeded, boosting Pepsi's earnings and market share. But America succeeded as well, as longstanding stereotypes were chipped away and African- Americans were recognized as both talented employees and valued customers. It was a significant step in our becoming a more inclusive society.On one level, The Real Pepsi Challenge, whose author is an editor and writer for The Wall Street Journal, is a straightforward business book about the birth of niche marketing. But, as we quickly learn, it is a truly inspirational story, recalling a time when we as a nation first learned to see the strength of our diversity. It is far more than a history of marketing in America; it is a key chapter in the social history of our nation.Until these men came along, typical advertisements depicted African-Americans as one-dimensional characters: Aunt Jemimas and Uncle Bens. But thereafter, Pepsi-Cola took a different approach, portraying American blacks for what they were increasingly becoming -- accomplished middle-class citizens. While such portrayals seem commonplace to us today, they were revolutionary in their time, and the men who brought them into existence risked day-to-day professional indignities parallel to those that Jackie Robinson suffered for breaking baseball's color line. As they crossed the country in the course of their jobs, they faced the cruelty of American racial attitudes. Jim Crow laws often limited where they could eat and sleep while on the road, and they faced resistance even within their own company. Yet these men succeeded as businessmen, and all went on to success in other professions as well, including medicine, journalism, education, and international diplomacy.Happily, six of these pioneers lived to tell their stories to the author. Their voices, full of pride, good humor, and sharp recollection, enrich these pages and give voice to the continuing American saga.	2007-01-09	Simon and Schuster						ZZZ000000

9780743276955	The Intention Experiment,Using Your Thoughts to Change Your Life and the World	Lynne McTaggart		The book you hold in your hands is revolutionary, a groundbreaking exploration of the science of intention. It is also the first book to invite you, the reader, to take an active part in its original research. Drawing on the findings of leading scientists on human consciousness from around the world, The Intention Experiment demonstrates that thought is a thing that affects other things. Thought generates its own palpable energy that you can use to improve your life, to help others around you, and to change the world.In The Intention Experiment, internationally bestselling author Lynne McTaggart, an award-winning science journalist and leading figure in the human consciousness studies community, presents a gripping scientific detective story and takes you on a mind-blowing journey to the farthest reaches of consciousness. She profiles the colorful pioneers in intention science and works with a team of renowned scientists from around the world, including physicist Fritz-Albert Popp of the International Institute of Biophysics and Dr. Gary Schwartz, professor of psychology, medicine, and neurology at the University of Arizona, to determine the effects of focused group intention on scientifically quantifiable targets -- animal, plant, and human.The Intention Experiment builds on the discoveries of McTaggart's first book, international bestseller The Field: The Quest for the Secret Force of the Universe, which documented discoveries that point to the existence of a quantum energy field. The Field created a picture of an interconnected universe and a scientific explanation for many of the most profound human mysteries, from alternative medicine and spiritual healing to extrasensory perception and the collective unconscious. The Intention Experiment shows you myriad ways that all this information can be incorporated into your life.After narrating the exciting developments in the science of intention, McTaggart offers a practical program to get in touch with your own thoughts, to increase the activity and strength of your intentions, and to begin achieving real change in your life. After you've begun to realize the amazing potential of focused intention, and the times when it is most powerful, McTaggart invites you to participate in an unprecedented experiment: Using The Intention Experiment website to coordinate your involvement and track results, you and other participants around the world will focus your power of intention on specific targets, giving you the opportunity to become a part of scientific history.The Intention Experiment redefines what a book does. It is the first "living" book in three dimensions. The book's text and website are inextricably linked, forming the hub of an entirely self-funded research program, the ultimate aim of which is philanthropic. An original piece of scientific investigation that involves the reader in its quest, The Intention Experiment explores human thought and intention as a tangible energy -- an inexhaustible but simple resource with an awesome potential to focus our lives, heal our illnesses, clean up our communities, and improve the planet.The Intention Experiment also forces you to rethink what it is to be human. As it proves, we're connected to everyone and everything, and that discovery demands that we pay better attention to our thoughts, intentions, and actions. Here's how you can.	2007-01-09	Simon & Schuster						ZZZ000000

9780743289177	No,Why Kids--of All Ages--Need to Hear It and Ways Parents Can Say It	David Walsh		No. It's not just a one-word answer, it's a parenting strategy. By saying No when you need to, you help your children develop skills such as self-reliance, self-discipline, respect, integrity, the ability to delay gratification, and a host of other crucial character traits they need to be successful. Although the importance of using No should be obvious, many parents have a hard time saying it -- even when they know they should -- when other parents and the culture around them are being permissive. Now, successful psychologist, bestselling author, and nationally known parenting expert Dr. David Walsh provides you with an arsenal of tactics, explanations, and examples for using No the right way with your kids. With Dr. Walsh's straightforward "parent tool kits," you can assess and improve your relationship with your kids, set and enforce limits that make sense for different ages (from toddlers to teens), and otherwise make No a positive influence on kids' behavior and in your overall family life. Other parenting books broach the topics of tough love and discipline, but only "No" offers the lively voice, warm wisdom, science made simple, and breadth of knowledge that readers have come to expect from Dr. Walsh. The first look at the psychological importance of No in a child's development, "No" is filled with down-to-earth advice that you can put into practice immediately. Dr. Walsh's memorable, affecting, and sometimes humorous anecdotes remind you that you're not alone in your parenting struggles and help you regain confidence in your own judgment and ability to say No. Hisstories also reinforce his message that establishing healthy limits is not only essential for kids' well-being, it's vital for creating disciplined, productive adults who can compete in a global marketplace and ensure a prosperous economic future for our country. Most important, "No" gives parents real, effective strategies for helping their children bloom and grow, giving them the psychological resources to become healthy, happy adults.	2007-01-09	Simon & Schuster						ZZZ000000
9780743291255	The halo effect-- and the eight other business delusions that deceive managers	Philip M. Rosenzweig		Much of our business thinking is shaped by delusions -- errors of logic and flawed judgments that distort our understanding of the real reasons for a company's performance. In a brilliant and unconventional book, Phil Rosenzweig unmasks the delusions that are commonly found in the corporate world. These delusions affect the business press and academic research, as well as many bestselling books that promise to reveal the secrets of success or the path to greatness. Such books claim to be based on rigorous thinking, but operate mainly at the level of storytelling. They provide comfort and inspiration, but deceive managers about the true nature of business success.The most pervasive delusion is the Halo Effect. When a company's sales and profits are up, people often conclude that it has a brilliant strategy, a visionary leader, capable employees, and a superb corporate culture. When performance falters, they conclude that the strategy was wrong, the leader became arrogant, the people were complacent, and the culture was stagnant. In fact, little may have changed -- company performance creates a Halo that shapes the way we perceive strategy, leadership, people, culture, and more.Drawing on examples from leading companies including Cisco Systems, IBM, Nokia, and ABB, Rosenzweig shows how the Halo Effect is widespread, undermining the usefulness of business bestsellers from In Search of Excellence to Built to Last and Good to Great.Rosenzweig identifies nine popular business delusions. Among them: The Delusion of Absolute Performance: Company performance is relative to competition, not absolute, which is why following a formula can never guarantee results. Success comes from doing things better than rivals, which means that managers have to take risks. The Delusion of Rigorous Research: Many bestselling authors praise themselves for the vast amount of data they have gathered, but forget that if the data aren't valid, it doesn't matter how much was gathered or how sophisticated the research methods appear to be. They trick the reader by substituting sizzle for substance. The Delusion of Single Explanations: Many studies show that a particular factor, such as corporate culture or social responsibility or customer focus, leads to improved performance. But since many of these factors are highly correlated, the effect of each one is usually less than suggested.In what promises to be a landmark book, The Halo Effect replaces mistaken thinking with a sharper understanding of what drives business success and failure. The Halo Effect is a guide for the thinking manager, a way to detect errors in business research and to reach a clearer understanding of what drives business success and failure.Skeptical, brilliant, iconoclastic, and mercifully free of business jargon, Rosenzweig's book is nevertheless dead serious, making his arguments about important issues in an unsparing and direct way that will appeal to a broad business audience. For managers who want to separate fact from fiction in the world of business, The Halo Effect is essential reading -- witty, often funny, and sharply argued, it's an antidote to so much of the conventional thinking that clutters business bookshelves.	2007	Free Press						ZZZ000000

9780743294522	The Power of Story,Rewrite Your Destiny in Business and in Life	Jim Loehr		In his groundbreaking new book, Dr. Jim Loehr, New York Times bestselling coauthor of The Power of Full Engagement, examines the way we tell stories about ourselves to ourselves -- and, most important, the way we can change those stories to transform our business and personal lives. "Your story is your life," says Loehr. As human beings, we continually tell ourselves stories -- of success or failure; of power or victimhood; stories that endure for an hour, or a day, or an entire lifetime. We have stories about our work, our families and relationships, our health; about what we want and what we're capable of achieving. Yet, while our stories profoundly affect how others see us and we see ourselves, too few of us even recognize that we're telling stories, or what they are, or that we can change them -- and, in turn, transform our very destinies.Telling ourselves stories provides structure and direction as we navigate life's challenges and opportunities, and helps us interpret our goals and skills. Stories make sense of chaos; they organize our many divergent experiences into a coherent thread; they shape our entire reality. And far too many of our stories, says Loehr, are dysfunctional, in need of serious editing. First, he asks you to answer the question, "In which areas of my life is it clear that I cannot achieve my goals with the story I've got?" He then shows you how to create new, reality-based stories that inspire you to action, and take you where you want to go both in your work and personal life.For decades, at the Human Performance Institute, Loehr has been examining the power of story to increase engagement and productivity, and Fortune 500 companies have paid millions to send employees to his program, in which he applies the principles and methods that he now offers in this book. Global business leaders, world-class athletes, military special forces, and thousands of individuals from every walk of life have sought out and benefited from his life-altering insight and expertise.Our capacity to tell stories is one of our profoundest gifts. Loehr's approach to creating deeply engaging stories will give you the tools to wield the power of storytelling and forever change your business and personal life.	2007-09-18	Simon & Schuster						ZZZ000000

He had witnessed violence already, both at home and abroad, but it wasn't until he covered his first war -- in El Salvador -- that he felt he had arrived. Armed with the fearlessness of youth he lived for the job, was in love with it, aware of the dangers but assuming the bullets and bombs were meant for others. In 2000, however, after eleven years in some of the world's most dangerous places, the bullets came too close for comfort, and a close friend was killed in Lebanon. This, and then the birth of his first child, began a process of reassessment that culminated in the end of the affair.

9780743450676	Two Sides of the Moon,Our Story of the Cold War Space Race	David Scott&Alexei Leonov		Growing up on either side of the Iron Curtain, Alexei Leonov and David Scott shared the same dream -- to become a pilot. Excelling at flying, they were chosen by their countries' burgeoning space programmes to be part of the greatest technological race ever -- to land a man on the moon. Cosmonaut Alexei Leonov became the first man to walk in space. He won a place in history, but almost lost his life. In 1966, David Scott and Neil Armstrong were seconds away from dying as Gemini 8 spun violently out of control across space. Both men survived against dramatic odds and Scott went on to command the most complex expedition in the history of space exploration, Apollo 15. When the US and USSR space programmes were eventually brought together in the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project, Scott and Leonov finally met. The project marked the end of the Cold War silence and started a friendship that would last for decades.	2005-04-04	Pocket books						ZZZ000000

9780743468053	A Sense of the World,How a Blind Man Became History's Greatest Traveller	Jason Roberts		When Lieutenant James Holman sailed to Russia in 1822, intent on crossing Siberia on his way to circumnavigate a globe still largely uncharted, the authorities of the Tsar arrested him on suspicion of espionage. Their scepticism was understandable: James Holman was completely blind. Holman returned to London and wrote a bestselling book about his abortive trip. But the wanderlust remained: as he put it, "In my case, the deprivation of sight has been succeeded by an increased desire for locomotion." In 1827 he set off again, this time for Africa. He would not return until 1832, having visited India, the Far East and Australia en route, and indulged in seemingly suicidal adventures such as stalking rogue elephants in Ceylon and helping blaze a road through uncharted New South Wales. For Holman it was the raw intensity of such experiences that kept depression at bay: he travelled in order to regain the sensation of feeling fully alive. Jason Roberts has used Holman's own writings as well as myriad other contemporary sources to weave a spellbinding narrative about this fascinating character. Full of suspense and humour, and vivid in its re-creation of a world experienced through the non-visual senses, A SENSE OF THE WORLD is a marvellous blend of travel, biography and history, and a great tribute to a man of rare spirit.	2007-05-08	Simon & Schuster, Limited						ZZZ000000

9780743492324	First Man,The Life of Neil Armstrong	James R. Hansen		On 20 July 1969, the world stood still to watch 38-year-old astronaut Neil Armstrong become the first person ever to walk on the Moon. Perhaps no words in recent human history became better known than those few he uttered at that historic moment. Upon his return to Earth, Armstrong was honoured and celebrated for his achievement. But he was also misunderstood. As authorised biographer James Hansen reveals in this fascinating and important book, it was the act of flying that had driven Armstrong rather than the pull of the destination, from his distinguished career as a fighter pilot in the Korean War right through to his most famous mission. Drawing on flight logs, family and Nasa archives and over 125 original interviews with key participants, FIRST MAN vividly re-creates Armstrong's life and career in flying, from the heights of honour earned as a naval aviator, test pilot and astronaut, to the dear personal price paid by Armstrong and, even more so, by his wife and children, for his dedication to his vocation. It is a unique portrait of a great but reluctant hero.	2006	Pocket						ZZZ000000

9780761134237	Younger next year,a guide to living like 50 until you're 80 and beyond	Chris Crowley&Henry S. Lodge		Turn back your biological clock. A breakthrough book for men--as much fun to read as it is persuasive--Younger Next Year draws on the very latest science of aging to show how men 50 or older can become functionally younger every year for the next five to ten years, and continue to live like fifty-year-olds until well into their eighties. To enjoy life and be stronger, healthier, and more alert. To stave off 70% of the normal decay associated with aging (weakness, sore joints, apathy), and to eliminate over 50% of all illness and potential injuries. This is the real thing, a program that will work for anyone who decides to apply himself to "Harry's Rules."Harry is Henry S. Lodge, M.D., a specialist in internal medicine and preventive healthcare. Chris Crowley is Harry's 70-year-old patient who's stronger today (and skiing better) than when he was 40. Together, in alternating chapters that are lively, sometimes outspoken, and always utterly convincing, they spell out Harry's Rules and the science behind them. The rules are deceptively simple: Exercise Six Days a Week. Eat What You Know You Should. Connect to Other People and Commit to Feeling Passionate About Something. The science, simplified and demystified, ranges from the molecular biology of growth and decay to how our bodies and minds evolved (and why they fare so poorly in our sedentary, all-feast no-famine culture). The result is nothing less than a paradigm shift in our view of aging.Welcome to the next third of your life--train for it, and you'll have a ball.	2004-12-04	Workman Pub.						ZZZ000000

9780786718870	The nuclear sphinx of Tehran,Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and the state of Iran	Yossi Melman&Meir Javedanfar		Inspired by hate and surrounded by fundamentalist leaders in a country that may soon posses nuclear weapons, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad poses the most serious threat to world peace, even while he shrewdly manipulates public opinion at home. Until now, Americans have known little about him. Since his election in June 2005, Ahmadinejad has accelerated his country's nuclear research; called for the elimination of Israel; and failed the Iranian people, who elected him on a since-neglected domestic platform. In this first book about him, we see the forces that are bringing the world to the brink of another war in the Middle East. Written by an Iranian-born insider and a world-renowned intelligence expert, it offers the first full portrait of this former mayor of Tehran whose rural roots and vituperative populism catapulted him from obscurity to national leadership. The authors examine the critical questions: Was Ahmadinejad personally involved in the assassination of Iranian political dissidents? Does he have close relations with terrorists in Iraq and Lebanon? While Iran acquired its nuclear secrets with the assistance of Western and Muslim businessmen, what religious and political influences persuaded Ahmadinejad to bring Iran back to the "glorious" days of Ayatollah Khomeini's Islamic Revolution of 1979? Did he play a role in the seizing of American hostages in 1979? With Iran on the verge of gaining nuclear weapons, even while it owns the world's second-largest oil reserves, any misunderstandings could lead to an enormous catastrophe for the West.	2007-03-21	Carroll & Graf Publishers						ZZZ000000

9780802138347	The African dream,the diaries of the revolutionary war in the Congo	Ernesto Guevara&Patrick Camiller		Ernesto "Che" Guevara was one of the greatest exemplars of the revolutionary 1960s, a man whose heroic adventures were essential to the success of the Cuban Revolution and whose legend fired the imaginations of a whole generation. In 1965, amid worldwide conjecture, Guevara left Cuba, where he was a minister in Fidel Castro's postrevolutionary government, and traveled incognito to the heart of Africa. People's hero Patrice Lumumba had recently been assassinated, and Guevara was to put his theories of guerrilla warfare to use helping the oppressed people of the Congo throw off the yoke of colonial imperialism. The first task was to assist the young Laurent Kabila in his struggle against Mobutu and Tshombe, the two key figures in the newly independent nation.For the first time, The African Dream collects Guevara's unabridged journals of the expedition. They are the record of the bitter failure of a political and ideological dream, and a telling complement to the subsequent rise of Kabila and his recent demise. Most of all, the diaries afford the reader a very personal insight into the thoughts and emotions of Che Guevara, the twentieth century's great revolutionary martyr.	2001-10-01	Grove Press						ZZZ000000

[This book] is both an urgent warning and a call to arms, outlining the history of climate change, how it will unfold over the next century, and what we can do to prevent a cataclysmic future. Along with a riveting history of climate change, [the author] offers specific suggestions for action for both lawmakers and individuals, from investing in renewable power sources like wind, solar, and geothermal energy, to offering an action plan with steps each and every one of us can take right now to reduce deadly CO2 emissions by as much as 70 percent. -Dust jacket.	2006-01-01	Grove Press						ZZZ000000

9780871139559	Thomas Paine's Rights of man,a biography	Christopher Hitchens		Thomas Paine was one of the greatest advocates of freedom in history, and his Declaration of the Rights of Man, first published in 1791, is the key to his reputation. Inspired by his outrage at Edmund Burke's attack on the French Revolution, Paine's text is a passionate defense of man's inalienable rights. Since its publication, Rights of Man has been celebrated, criticized, maligned, suppressed, and co-opted, but in Thomas Paine's Rights of Man, the polemicist and commentator Christopher Hitchens marvels at its forethought and revels in its contentiousness. Hitchens is a political descendant of the great pamphleteer, and in this engaging work he demonstrates how Thomas Paine's book forms the philosophical cornerstone of the United States of America, and how, "in a time when both rights and reason are under attack, the life and writing of Thomas Paine will always be part of the arsenal on which we shall need to depend."	2007-07-10	Atlantic Monthly Press						ZZZ000000

Born in a two-room flat in London's Soho amid political squabbles and personal tragedy, the first volume of Das Kapital was published in 1867, to muted praise. But after Marx's death, the book went on to influence thinkers, writers, and revolutionaries, from George Bernard Shaw to V. I. Lenin, changing the direction of twentieth-century history. Wheen's captivating, accessible book shows that, far from being a dry economic treatise, Das Kapital is like a vast Gothic novel whose heroes are enslaved by the monster they created: capitalism. Furthermore, Wheen argues, as long as capitalism endures, Das Kapital demands to be read and understood.	2007-11-10	Atlantic Monthly Press						ZZZ000000

9781400065592	Kabul Beauty School,an American woman goes behind the veil	Deborah Rodriguez&Kristin Ohlson		Soon after the fall of the Taliban, in 2001, Deborah Rodriguez went to Afghanistan as part of a group offering humanitarian aid to this war-torn nation. Surrounded by men and women whose skillsas doctors, nurses, and therapistsseemed eminently more practical than her own, Rodriguez, a hairdresser and mother of two from Michigan, despaired of being of any real use. Yet she soon found she had a gift for befriending Afghans, and once her profession became known she was eagerly sought out by Westerners desperate for a good haircut and by Afghan women, who have a long and proud tradition of running their own beauty salons. Thus an idea was born. With the help of corporate and international sponsors, the Kabul Beauty School welcomed its first class in 2003. Well meaning but sometimes brazen, Rodriguez stumbled through language barriers, overstepped cultural customs, and constantly juggled the challenges of a postwar nation even as she learned how to empower her students to become their families' breadwinners by learning the fundamentals of coloring techniques, haircutting, and makeup. Yet within the small haven of the beauty school, the line between teacher and student quickly blurred as these vibrant women shared with Rodriguez their stories and their hearts: the newlywed who faked her virginity on her wedding night, the twelve-year-old bride sold into marriage to pay her family's debts, the Taliban member's wife who pursued her training despite her husband's constant beatings. Through these and other stories, Rodriguez found the strength to leave her own unhealthy marriage and allow herself to love again, Afghan style. With warmth and humor, Rodriguez details the lushness of a seemingly desolate region and reveals the magnificence behind the burqa.Kabul Beauty Schoolis a remarkable tale of an extraordinary community of women who come together and learn the arts of perms, friendship, and freedom.	2007	Random House						ZZZ000000

9781401222666	Watchmen	Alan Moore&Dave Gibbons		DC Comics presents a special, new edition of the WATCHMEN, complete with recolored cover art by artist extraordinaire Dave Gibbons The WATCHMEN INTERNATIONAL EDITION is created especially for the international market, and is also available in the U.S. and Canada. One of the most influential graphic novels of all time and a perennial bestseller, WATCHMEN has only grown in stature since its original publication. Along with a new cover by Gibbons, this volume features the high-quality, recolored pages from WATCHMEN: THE ABSOLUTE EDITION, restored by Wild-Storm FX and original series colorist John Higgins. Directed by Zac Snyder (300, Sin City) the Watchmen is the most eagerly anticipated cinematic release of 2008. This special export edition graphic novel takes you back to where it all began. Penned by the legendary Alan Moore, the Watchmen has transcended its genre to become one of the great literary pieces of the 20th Century. Set in the mid 1980s, the story follows a group of super heroes led by the mysterious Dr.Manhattan. A plot has been hatched to discredit and kill them as freaks. Packed with symbolism, some of the overlying themes (arms control, nuclear threat, vigilantes) have dated but the intelligent social and political commentary, the structure of the story itself, its intertextuality (chapters appended with excerpts from other "works" and "studies" on Moore's characters, or with excerpts from another comic book being read by a child within the story), the fine pace of the writing and its humanity mean that Watchmen more than stands up--it keeps its crown as the best the genre has yet produced.	2008-01-01	DC Comics						ZZZ000000

Over the next three decades, his exploits in the Caribbean in the service of the English became legend. His daring attacks on the mighty Spanish Empire on land and sea changed the fates of kings and queens. His victories helped shape the destiny of the New World. Morgan gathered disaffected English and European sailors and soldiers, hard-bitten adventurers, runaway slaves, cutthroats and sociopaths and turned them into the fiercest and most feared army in the Western Hemisphere. Sailing out from the English stronghold of Port Royal, Jamaica, 'the wickedest city in the New World', Morgan and his men terrorised Spanish merchant ships and devastated the cities where great riches in silver, gold, and gems lay waiting to be sent to the King of Spain. His last raid, a daring assault on the fabled city of Panama, helped break Spain's solitary hold on the New World for ever. Awash with bloody battles, political intrigues, and a cast of characters more compelling, bizarre and memorable than any found in a Hollywood swashbuckler, EMPIRE OF BLUE WATER brilliantly re-creates the passions and the violence of the age of exploration and empire. What's more, it chillingly depicts the apocalyptic natural disaster that finally ended the pirates' dominion.	2008-05-06	Pocket Books						ZZZ000000

Though he has been involved with women like Diane Keaton and Beverly D'Angelo, the mother of his three children, he has never married and here reveals why, and how his feelings have changed.

9781416524243	The twelfth card	Jeffery Deaver		A high-school girl in Harlem, Geneva Settle, is the target of a ruthless professional killer - Thompson Boyd - who has been hired to murder her for reasons unknown. His first attempt, in a deserted museum early one morning, is a failure but it's clear to Lincoln Rhyme that he's going to strike again, from clues the killer leaves behind, one of which is the twelfth card in the tarot deck, The Hanged Man, whose meaning resonates eerily throughout the story. Assisted by Fred Dellray, Mel Cooper and Lon Sellitto (suffering from a severe case of shattered nerves due to a near miss by the killer), Rhyme and partner Amelia Sachs work frantically to learn who the hit man and his partner are and when they will strike next, all the while trying to crack a very 'cold' case - Rhyme believes that Geneva may have been targeted because of a paper she's writing about her ancestor, Charles Singleton, a former slave who was instrumental in the civil rights movement in the 1860s, but who was arrested for theft and disgraced. In his correspondence Charles wrote about a 'secret,' that could have tragic consequences if revealed. This secret, which Rhyme is convinced will provide the key to why Geneva is in danger, revolves around some mysterious doings in the area known as Gallows Heights, a neighborhood on the Upper West Side of Manhattan that in the 1860s was a tense mix of wealthy financiers, civil rights leaders, political crooks like Boss Tweed, and working-class laborers and thugs. What was the truth behind the crime Charles was accused of? And what was his secret? Does it have to do with stolen gold? Or does it have a far broader implications? Other complications keep the pot boiling - Rhyme is struggling through extensive therapy; will it have any effect on his quadriplegic conditions? And fiercely independent Geneva Settle battles both the killers and her protectors to maintain order in her life so that she can escape from Harlem to college and Europe as soon as possible.	2006-03-31	Pocket Star Books						ZZZ000000

For Helen, it's a dream come true, although her husband is not as thrilled about it as she had hoped. Not only wrestling with painful ghosts of the past, Helen has to deal with the fact that her outwardly perfect marriage is crumbling before her eyes. For Janey, it is an unmitigated disaster as she has just been offered the career break of a life-time.

Heart-warming, up-lifting, tear-jerking and lovely, THE YORKSHIRE PUDDING CLUB is the story of how three women find themselves empowered by unexpected pregnancy. How it revitalises one woman's tired marriage, strengthens another's belief in herself and brings love and warmth to a cold and empty life.	2007-03-05	Pocket Books						FIC000000

9781416526001	The Egg and Sperm Race	Matthew Cobb		Where do we come from? For thousands of years we really had no clue how living things were created -- great thinkers like Aristotle and Plato had attempted to explain what became known as the problem of 'generation', but neither really had the tools or the insight to solve the mystery. The result was a wealth of weird and wonderful ideas about the components necessary to create new life -- blood, 'vapours', strange pulses in the air. It was also widely accepted that animals could breed different species; the notion that two sheep can only make another sheep is a surprisingly modern idea. But all this confusion changed in a flurry of discovery in the mid-seventeenth century. In just a decade, a group of young scientists in Europe established the existence first of the human egg and then of the human sperm. At last, the building blocks were in place -- although, in one of the great ironies of science, it would be another 150 years before someone worked out how fertilisation actually took place. Focusing on the personalities and rivalries of this extraordinary period, Matthew Cobb has shed new light not just on an under-reported story of science but on our very nature -- and how little we still know about one of the greatest miracles of Nature.	2007-05-08	Pocket Books						ZZZ000000

But what if we decided not to buy anything for a whole year? Obviously, we would need necessities like food and soap, but how would be manage without new clothes, treats, entertainment? Funny, smart and self-deprecating, Not Buying It is a close look at our society's obsession with shopping and the cold turkey confession of a woman we can all identify with - someone who can't live without French roast coffee and expensive wool socks, but who has had enough of spending money for the sake of it.

Tracking their progress and lapses, she contemplates the meanings of need and desire, scarcity and security, consumerism and citizenship.

Now The Impulse Factor offers readers a unique online opportunity to analyze their own decision-making style and harness it to improve their everyday lives. Each book comes with access to a proprietary assessment developed specifically to evaluate impulsivity. With examples from business, psychology, and Tasler's own research at TalentSmart, the book also vividly illustrates how susceptible we are to the events around us and how our reactions often run contrary to our best interests.By combining his research with real-world examples of extreme decision making, Tasler teaches readers how to thrive when faced with difficult choices. More than just a book, The Impulse Factor provides a clear understanding of why you make the choices you do -- and the tools to make those decisions change your business and your life.	2008-10-07	Simon & Schuster						ZZZ000000

9781586483036	Auschwitz,a new history	Laurence Rees		Auschwitz-Birkenau is the site of the largest mass murder in human history. Yet its story is not fully known. In Auschwitz, Laurence Rees reveals new insights from more than 100 original interviews with Auschwitz survivors and Nazi perpetrators who speak on the record for the first time. Their testimonies provide a portrait of the inner workings of the camp in unrivalled detail-from the techniques of mass murder, to the politics and gossip mill that turned between guards and prisoners, to the on-camp brothel in which the lines between those guards and prisoners became surprisingly blurred. Rees examines the strategic decisions that led the Nazi leadership to prescribe Auschwitz as its primary site for the extinction of Europe's Jews-their "Final Solution." He concludes that many of the horrors that were perpetrated in Auschwitz were driven not just by ideological inevitability but as a "practical" response to a war in the East that had begun to go wrong for Germany. A terrible immoral pragmatism characterizes many of the decisions that determined what happened at Auschwitz. Thus the story of the camp becomes a morality tale, too, in which evil is shown to proceed in a series of deft, almost noiseless incremental steps until it produces the overwhelming horror of the industrial scale slaughter that was inflicted in the gas chambers of Auschwitz. Insights gleaned from more than one hundred original interviews shed new light on history's most famous death camp, with the testimonies of survivors providing a detailed and chilling portrait of the camp's inner workings, in a companion volume to the PBS documentary.	2005	Public Affairs						ZZZ000000
9781586858582	Forgotten modern,California houses 1940-1970	Alan Hess&Alan Weintraub		Mid-Century Architecture in Modern California reveals the work of the innovative architects building in California from the 1930s to the 1970s. With groundbreaking and illuminating examples that will alter the way we think of California architecture, Hess and Weintraub focus on those that exemplify early mid-century modern, variations on minimalism, and organic architecture. Though architects, historians, and the public alike have overlooked have overlooked many of these superb architects from California's past century, this book intends to bring them back to our attention. All the architects included here are important in helping to show the breadth of design, that styles like organic were more widely represented than we have previously realized, and that the fertile soil of California design fostered a wide spectrum of remarkable ideas- even of not all developed a significant school of followers.	2007	Gibbs Smith						ZZZ000000

9781842126554	In search of Zarathustra,the first prophet and the ideas that changed the world	Paul Kriwaczek		IN SEARCH OF ZARATHUSTRA is a quest to trace the influence of the prophet the Greeks called Zoroaster and considered the greatest religious legislator of the ancient world. Long before the first Hebrew temple, the birth of Christ or the mission of Muhammad, Zarathustra had taught of a single universal god, of the battle between Good and Evil, of the Devil, Heaven and Hell, and of an eventual end to the world.Over several decades, Paul Kriwaczek, an award-winning television producer, has cast his eye across Europe and Central Asia, from Hadrian's Wall to the Oxus river, from the Pyrenees to the Hindu Kush.Passing via Nietzsche's interpretation of Zarathustra for a post-religious age, the Cathars of 13th-century France, the Bulgars of 9th-century Balkans, and the prophet Mani's revision of Zarathustra's message in the later Persian empire, Paul Kriwaczek then explores the religion of Mithras - before going back past Alexander the Great's destruction of the Persian Empire, and the era of the great Persian kings Cyrus and Darius in the 6th century BC, to the beginning of the first pre-Christian millennium.	2003-02-06	Phoenix						ZZZ000000

9781845963651	Gaspipe,Confessions of a Mafia Boss	Philip Carlo		Anthony Gaspipe Casso, former head of the Lucchese family, is currently serving 13 life sentences at a federal prison in Colorado. Now, he has given bestselling author Philip Carlo the most intimate look into the world of La Cosa Nostra ever seen. Cassos mob life was preordained. His father introduced the young Anthony to the men of honour who did business by shaking pinky-ringed hands hands equally at home gripping the cold steel of a silenced pistol. The budding mobster watched and listened, and decided that he would devote his life to crime. Casso concocted ingenious schemes to hijack trucks, rob banks and traffic vast quantities of marijuana and heroin shattering the myth that the Mafia didnt handle drugs. He also worked with the other Mafia families and forged strong ties with the Russian mob, but the law finally caught up with him in his New Jersey safe house in 1994 and, rather than stoically face the music like the old-time mafiosi he revered, Casso became the thing he hated a rat. Detailing Cassos feud with John Gotti, the Windows Case that led to the beginning of the end for the mob in New York, and Cassos dealings with the NYPD Mafia cops, Gaspipe is a chilling and illuminating roller-coaster ride into a netherworld few outsiders have ever dared to enter.	2008-08-07	Mainstream Publishing Company, Limited						ZZZ000000

9781846040405	How to See Yourself As You Really Are	Dalai Lama		IHow to See Yourself As You Really Are/I is based on a fundamental Buddhist notion that love and insight work together to bring about enlightenment, like two wings of a bird. It provides a new perspective on the psychological problems of hurting ourselves through misguided, exaggerated notions of self, others, events and physical things. It shows how even our senses deceive us, drawing us into unwise attachments and negative actions that can only come back to haunt us in the future. Drawing on wisdom and techniques refined in Tibetan monasteries for more than a thousand years, and adopting as its structure traditional Buddhist steps of meditative reflection, IHow to See Yourself As You Really Are/I includes practical exercises and gives readers a clear path to assess their growth and progress. The book is enlivened throughout with warm personal anecdotes and intimate accounts of the Dalai Lama's experiences as a life-long student, a meditator, a political leader and an international figure working with other Nobel Peace Laureates to address crises around the world.	2008-01-03	Random House						ZZZ000000

9781846041075	The Road Less Travelled,A New Psychology of Love, Traditional Values and Spiritual Growth	M Scott Peck		Confronting and solving problems is a painful process which most of us attempt to avoid.

Scott Peck, a psychiatrist, suggests ways in which facing our difficulties - and suffering through the changes - can enable us to reach a higher level of self-understanding. He discusses the nature of loving relationships: how to distinguish dependency from love; how to become one's own person and how to be a more sensitive parent. This is a book that can show you how to embrace reality and yet achieve serenity and a richer existence. Hugely influential, it has now sold over six million copies - and has changed many people's lives round the globe. It may change yours.	2008-02-07	RIDER						ZZZ000000

Yet this impressive collection of her writings shows a new and unexpected picture of the Nobel Peace Prize winner.

This book is a moving chronicle of her spiritual journey and it reveals the secrets she shared only with her closest confidants. It also illustrates how the experience of agonizing doubts need not hold anyone back from doing something extraordinary with their lives..	2008-08-07	RIDER						ZZZ000000

9781846051968	New York	Edward Rutherfurd		Edward Rutherfurd tells the story of this great city as no other author could from the epic, empty grandeur of the New World to the skyscrapers of the City that Never Sleeps, from the intimate detail of lives long forgotten to those lived today at breakneck speed. The novel begins with a tiny Indian fishing village and the Dutch traders who first carved out their hopes amidst the splendour of the wilderness. The British settlers and merchants followed, with their aristocratic governors and unpopular taxation which led to rebellion, war, the burning of the city and the birth of the American Nation. Yet a country that had already rent itself asunder once did so again over slavery. As the country fought its bloody Civil War, the city was torn apart by deadly riots. Hopes and dreams, greed and corruption - they have always been the companions of freedom and opportunity in the city s teeming streets. As the immigrant ships berthed next to Ellis Island in the shadow of the Statue of Liberty, they poured more and more Germans, Irish, Italians and Jews into the churning ethnic mix of the city. Deals were struck, politicians corrupted, men bought or assassinated, heiresses wooed, fortunes were speculated on Wall Street and men became rich beyond the dreams of avarice. The heady seesaw of wealth and poverty was seen in the Roaring Twenties and the Great Crash, the city s future symbolised by its buildings which literally touched the sky: the Empire State, the Chrysler Building, the Twin Towers. Rutherfurd tells this irresistible story through a cast of fictional and true characters whose fates interweave in the rise and fall, fall and rise of the city s fortunes. It is the story of how in four centuries New York became the envy of the world. And in telling the story through the lens of New York, Rutherfurd brings the story of America itself to unforgettable life in this epic masterpiece.	2009-09	Random House						FIC000000

Whereas books like 'He's Just Not That Into You' explored relationship troubles in black and white, 'Deal Breakers' covers all the shades of grey that lie in between - all those areas where relationships can hit an impasse. Some deal breakers are easy to identify - one partner wants marriage, the other doesn't - yet many are more subtle and difficult to pinpoint. Dr Bethany Marshall is a relationships expert. She has identified specific male archetypes and the traits that frustrate and infuriate their partners. Here, for the first time in book form, is advice that can help any woman who is trying too hard to make her relationship work.	2007-04-16	Simon & Schuster, Limited						FAM027000

When Alice finally finds the courage to come out of her shell, exchanging her dowdy looks for flattering clothes and make-up, her life is completely transformed. She even attends her high school prom with a cute, popular boy. But the night turns suddenly tragic -- sending her new-found happiness crashing down around her, and hurtling Alice into a shattering new life: one that leads her to a shocking reunion with the shadows she had fled.	2010-07-01	POCKET BOOKS						FIC027000

9781847393814	A Darkness Forged in Fire	Chris Evans		Rejected by their own kind for bearing the mark of the Shadow Monarch, the Iron Elves chose instead to serve with the human armies of the Calahrian Empire, hoping through their dedication and discipline to wipe out the stain of their birth. Their reputation is legendary -- until their commander, Konowa Swiftdragon, takes it upon himself -- for the best of reasons -- to assassinate the Viceroy. Court-martialled and exiled to the forest he despises, his beloved regiment disgraced, dishonoured and disbanded, Konowa finds himself suddenly recalled and ordered to re-form the Iron Elves for one last reconnaissance mission. But the new Iron Elves are not at all the same as they were before, and the mission is a suicidal one, with more at stake than Konowa could possibly have imagined. For the Shadow Monarch and her allies have harnessed destructive forces with the power to tear worlds apart -- and those who bear her mark have a destiny greater than they know. So begins an heroic journey in the company of a motley band of misfits, rebels and outcasts, with a central character whose engaging, brilliantly realised blend of cynicism, dry humour, duty and anguish make him unlike any other in fantasy fiction.	2009-07-06	Pocket						FIC009000
9781847394231	Lifeblood	N. J. Cooper		Six months on from the events in NO ESCAPE, forensic psychologist Karen Taylor is busy assessing prisoners out on parole for a Ministry of Justice project designed to predict which of them will re-offend. One of them is Randall Greer, a violent serial rapist, whose last offence took place on the Isle of Wight. Karen is sure he will attack again - and that this time he will probably kill. So when Randall breaks the terms of his parole and goes missing, Karen breaks all the rules. She returns to the Isle of Wight to warn DCI Charlie Trench, because he was involved in Greer's arrest and subsequent trial for the rape of Lizzie Fane. Randall had threatened to kill Lizzie if she gave evidence against him. Lizzie Fane has secretly reinvented herself as Lisa Raithe, and is enjoying a burgeoning career as a successful artist. She's settled into an attractive village well away from the Island - and has tentatively started dating again. As Lisa, she has everything going for her. Until she hears that Randall is out, and on the loose. She has stoically rebuilt her shattered life - how far will she go to protect it? Soon people who gave evidence at Randall's trial are found murdered. Has the rapist now turned killer, as Karen predicted? Has Lizzie herself turned avenging angel? Or, as Karen starts to suspect, is someone else pulling the strings?	2010	Simon & Schuster, Limited						ZZZ000000

9781847396365	Life with My Sister Madonna	Christopher Ciccone&Wendy Leigh		Christopher Ciccone's extraordinary memoir is based on his forty-seven years of growing up with, working with and understanding the most famous woman of our time. Throughout most of the iconic star's kaleidoscopic career, Christopher played an important role in her life: as her back-up dancer, her personal assistant, her dresser, her decorator, her art director and tour director. Only Christopher can tell the full and riveting story behind her carefully constructed mythology, and reveal the real woman behind the glittering facade. From their shared Michigan childhood and the early days in Manhattan, when he slept on her roach-infested floor and danced with her in clubs all over town, Christopher was with her every step of the way, experiencing her first-hand in all her incarnations. The punk drummer, the raunchy Boy Toy, Material Girl, Mrs Sean Penn, loving mother, Mrs Guy Ritchie, English grand dame -- Christopher witnessed and understood all of them, as his own life was inexorably entwined with that of his chameleon sister. He tangled with a cast of characters from artist Jean-Michel Basquiat, to Gwyneth Paltrow, Kate Moss, Demi Moore and, of course, Guy Ritchie, whose advent in Madonna's life splintered the loving relationship Christopher once had with her. The mirror image of his legendary sister, with his acid Ciccone tongue, Christopher pulls no punches as he tells his astonishing story.	2009-07-06	POCKET BOOKS						ZZZ000000

9781847673152	The Decisive Moment,How the Brain Makes Up Its Mind	Jonah Lehrer		Since Plato, philosophers have described the decision-making process as either rational or emotional: we carefully deliberate or we blink and go with our gut. But as scientists break open the minds black box with the latest tools of neuroscience, theyre discovering this is not how the mind works. Our best decisions are a finely tuned blend of both feeling and reason and the precise mix depends on the situation. When buying a house, for example, its best to let our unconscious mull over the many variables. But when were picking stocks and shares, intuition often leads us astray. The trick is to determine when to lean on which part of the brain, and to do this, we need to think harder (and smarter) about how we think.In The Decisive Moment, Jonah Lehrer arms us with the tools we need, drawing on cutting-edge research by Daniel Kahneman, Colin Camerer and others, as well as the worlds most interesting deciders from airline pilots, world famous sportsmen and hedge fund investors to serial killers, politicians and poker players. He shows how the fluctuations of a few dopamine neurons saved a battleship during the Persian Gulf War, and how the fevered activity of a single brain region led to the sub-prime mortgage crisis. Lehrers goal is to answer two questions that are of interest to just about anyone, from CEOs to firefighters: How does the human mind make decisions? And how can we make those decisions better?	2010-03-04	Canongate Books						ZZZ000000

Murray		Most of us think that outstanding success derives only from groundbreaking innovation. But we're wrong. In fact, many of the most successful business ideas of our time have come about when someone has borrowed and adapted an idea from somewhere else. In Borrowing Brilliance, David Kord Murray explains exactly how you can do the same. He demonstrates conclusively that new business ideas are simply combinations of existing ideas and then sets out to show how you can solve current problems and create new opportunities by learning where to look for ideas and answers. In the process, he takes you through a simple six-step programme that will help you not only create the right mindset to innovate, but test the ideas you come up with, and implement them successfully. His reassuring message throughout is that since brilliance can be borrowed, it lies within the reach of us all.	2009-07-02	Random House						BUS025000

9781856694292	New bar and club design	Bethan Ryder		"Following the highly successful Bar and Club Design (2002), New Bar and Club Design examines current international trends, showcasing 47 bars and clubs completed since 2001." "The 1990s restaurant boom led to an increase in both the volume and diversity of restaurants, and this in turn heralded an increasingly sophisticated bar market. There has been a resurgence of cocktail culture and an explosion of the 'style bar' - professionally designed venues that serve high-quality drinks. As this book demonstrates, such bars continue to open in cities from New York to Moscow, Beirut to Kuala Lumpur. There is also a trend in lower-budget designer bars that are as visually interesting as the big budget productions, such as Andy Wahloo in Paris and Opal in London." "Likewise, club culture continues to thrive. Many nightclubs are cosier than the 'superclubs' so popular during the late 1980s and '90s, and recent years have seen the emergence of the 'boutique club' - small, exclusive nightclubs where the focus has returned to the music, the sound system and the dancing. Other alternatives include late-night lounge bars with DJs that cater to the 'grown-up clubber', offering comfort and luxury rather than an empty shell in which to dance. Some 'superclubs' are still being built and these offer the very best in technology and audiovisual entertainment, usually laid out over several different areas. This book explores the design Zeitgeist of bar and club culture worldwide." "Following a brief introduction tracing the latest international trends, four themed chapters on bars, restaurant bars, hotel bars and clubs showcase the most interesting and unusual venues from around the world. New Bar and Club Design is a must for anyone with an interest in interior design, bar or club culture."--BOOK JACKET.	2005-10	Laurence King Publishing						ZZZ000000

9781865088365	Legends of Cricket	Geoff Armstrong		In order to identify the 25 greatest cricketers of all time, ESPN assembled a panel of eminent cricket authorities. The result of their deliberations became the basis for ESPN's Legends of Cricket. The panel included Richie Benaud, Dickie Bird, Allan Border, Ian Botham, Ian Chappell, Sunil Gavaskar and Sir Richard Hadlee.The final 'legends' and the order in which they belong generated considerable debate. Most agree that Sir Donald Bradman is entitled to be No. 1, and Sir Garfield Sobers No. 2, but after that, opinions diverge. Can you compare WG Grace with Sachin Tendulkar? Who was the greatest West Indian fast bowler? Was Ian Botham, Sir Richard Hadlee, Imran Khan or Kapil Dev the best all-rounder of the '80s? Has Dennis Lillee's impact on the game been greater than that of Shane Warne? Greg Chappell is here; how about Steve Waugh and Allan Border? Which South Africans make the top 25?In Legends of Cricket, Geoff Armstrong profiles each of the champions who made the top 25. The profiles feature the opinions of more than 40 current and former Test stars, including 21 Test captains, the world's most famous umpire and a number of high-profile commentators and writers.What do the greats profiled here have in common? They all have powerful personalities, an unerring self-belief, courage and an unshakeable love for the game.

9781874061083	The Manchurian candidate	Richard Condon		"Everybody knows the controversial 1962 film of The Manchurian Candidate starring Frank Sinatra and Angela Lansbury, even though it was taken out of circulation for twenty-five years after JFK's assassination. Equally controversial on publication, and just as timely today, is Richard Condon's original novel. First published in 1959, at the height of cold war paranoia, The Manchurian Candidate is a terrifying and suspenseful political thriller featuring Sergeant Raymond Shaw, ex-prisoner of war, Medal of Honor winner, American hero...and brainwashed assassin. Condon's expert manipulation of the book's multiple themes - from anticommunist hysteria to megalomaniacal motherhood - makes this one of the most entertaining, and enduring, books of the era."--BOOK JACKET.	2000-01	Four Walls Eight Windows						ZZZ000000

9781905211364	Bad samaritans,rich nations, poor policies and the threat to the developing world	Ha-Joon Chang		It's rare that a book appears with a fresh perspective on world affairs, but renowned economist Ha-Joon Chang has some startlingly original things to say about the future of globalization. In theory, he argues, the world's wealthiest countries and supra-national institutions like the IMF, World Bank and WTO want to see all nations developing into modern industrial societies. In practice, though, those at the top are 'kicking away the ladder' to wealth that they themselves climbed. Why? Self-interest certainly plays a part. But, more often, rich and powerful governments and institutions are actually being 'Bad Samaritans': their intentions are worthy but their simplistic free-market ideology and poor understanding of history leads them to inflict policy errors on others. Chang demonstrates this by contrasting the route to success of economically vibrant countries with the very different route now being dictated to the world's poorer nations. In the course of this, he shows just how muddled the thinking is in such key areas as trade and foreign investment. He shows that the case for privatisation and against state involvement is far from proven. And he explores the ways in which attitudes to national cultures and political ideologies are obscuring clear thinking and creating bad policy. Finally, he argues the case for new strategies for a more prosperous world that may appall the 'Bad Samaritans'.	2007-07-05	Random House Business						ZZZ000000

Early projects such as the Light Urbanism study for the Municipality of Rotterdam, the headquarters for Public Broadcasting Company VPRO and housing for elderly Wozoco's in Amsterdam brought MVRDV to the attention of a wide field of clients and gave them international acclaim. What stands out as the characteristic feature of MVRDV is an adherence to reality and the need to strip the eye of preconceived ideas. The operational methodology that stems from this is centered around the application of the "technique" of the datascape, based on extensive and generalized research that tends to assemble an enormous quantity of information so as to proceed to the project phase in a rational, objective manner. The book examines the distinctive features of MVRDV's work and shows the full range of their achievements.	2006-10-24	Skira						ZZZ000000

The truth is, however, that few people - if any - ever achieve their true potential. What stops us, bizarrely, is ourselves. We are all inherently self-limiting and are unwittingly sabotaged by hidden fears and insecurities created by past experiences. Using a revolutionary blend of Neuro-Linguistic Programming, hypnosis and psychology, Jamil Qureshi - the Mind Coach - teaches us that the real secret to success lies in our ability to trust in our subconscious skills and shows us how to work with what we have, rather than what we think we lack. The Mind Coach is unique, innovative and spectacularly successful - not just for CEOs and professional sportspeople, but for every one of us who wants to make the most of our lives.

The journey became an inspirational and, at times, downright silly adventure which was chronicled in a book that went on to be an international bestseller -- Round Ireland with a Fridge. In The Fridge-Hiker's Guide to Life, Tony looks back on what he learnt on his quixotic quest. Namely: if all you have between birth and death is a journey, then wouldn't it be best to make it fun?

If you see someone lying injured in the middle of the road, for example, your attention would go to that person, but, if a bright pink dog wandered past at the same time, your attention would automatically stray to the dog, rather than the poor person lying prone in the road, and that is precisely the weakness of attention - it is pulled to the unusual. How much attention do we pay to the usual? So, what can we do about it? Well, instead of waiting for attention to be pulled towards something unusual, we can set out frameworks for 'directing' our attention in a conscious manner. Just as we can decide to look north, west or even south-east, so we can set up a framework for directing our attention, and that's where Edward de Bono's 'six frames' come into it. Each frame is a direction or method in/with which to look, based on a different shape - triangle, circle, heart, square, diamond, slab - for ease of reference. Today we are literally surrounded by information and it has never been so easy to obtain. Yet, information itself is not enough; it's how we look at it that really counts. Using the 'six frames' technique is the key to extracting real value from the masses of facts an figures out there and, like all de Bono's techniques, it is simple, effective and will utterly change the way you interpret information.	2008-08-07	Vermilion						ZZZ000000
9780091924287	The Diet Delusion	Gary Taubes		Where mainstream nutritional science has demonised dietary fat for 50 years, hundreds of millions of dollars of research have failed to prove that eating a low-fat diet will help you live longer. Nutrition and obesity scientists have struggled to make sense of the paradox that obesity has become an epidemic, that diabetes rates have soared and the incidence of heart disease has not declined despite the fact that society is more diet and health aware today than generations ago. The Diet Delusion is an in-depth, scientific, groundbreaking examination of what actually happens in your body as a result of what you eat, rather than what the diet industry might have you believe happens and is essential reading for anyone trying to decide which diet - low-fat or low-carbohydrate - is truly the healthy diet. For years we have been deluded by the dieting industry. Now it's time to find out the truth.	2009-01-01	Random House						ZZZ000000

So in deference to the dumbing down of our culture, comes Dim Wit - a collection of the most jaw-droppingly stupid things ever said. The cast includes every famous foot-in-mouther from George W Bush to Prince Philip, Paris Hilton to Jade Goody, not to mention hundreds of unsung idiots plucked from villages the world over. The result is a confederacy of dunces more pro-fun than profound - a clever witticism may coax an inward smile but it takes a really stupid remark to deliver a belly laugh. So pick up Dim Wit and prepare to embrace your inner moron - it may be the smartest thing you do... 'My grandma overheard two women talking in a doctor's surgery.

9780091925673	The Case of the Man Who Died Laughing,From the Files of Vish Puri, Most Private Investigator	Tarquin Hall		Early one morning, on the lawns of a grand boulevard in central Delhi, a group of professionals are attending their therapeutic Laughing Club when a 20-foot apparition of the Goddess Kali apppears, and strikes one of their number dead. The goddess disappears without trace, and soon news of the crime has all India agog. For the victim is celebrated sceptic and rationalist Dr Suresh Jha, enemy of all gurus and mystics, and he has been silenced in a manner calculated to unnerve even his most loyal supporters. As the media go into a frenzy, it becomes clear that the case goes to the heart of the battle between superstition and rationality in modern India. But the fact remains that a murder has been committed. And as it becomes clear that powerful forces are at play, one man is perfectly placed to investigate: the portly detective Vish Puri. In fact, the idea that he could resist getting involved in such a tantalizing murder is preposterous. There is as much chance of him going without his lunch.	2010	Random House						FIC022000
9780091925857	Portobello	Ruth Rendell		The Portobello area of West London has a rich personality vibrant, brilliant in colour, noisy, with graffiti that approach art, bizarre and splendid. An indefinable edge to it adds a spice of danger. There is nothing safe about Portobello... Eugene Wren inherited an art gallery from his father near an arcade that now sells cashmere, handmade soaps and children's clothes. But he decided to move to a more upmarket site in Kensington Church Street. Eugene was fifty, with prematurely white hair. He was, perhaps, too secretive for his own good. He also had an addictive personality. But he had cut back radically on his alcohol consumption and had given up cigarettes. Which was just as well, considering he was going out with a doctor. For all his good intentions, though, there was something he didn't want her to know about... On a shopping trip one day, Eugene, quite by chance, came across an envelope containing money. He picked it up. For some reason, rather than report the matter to the police, he wrote a note and stuck it up on lamppost near his house: 'Found in Chepstow Villas, a sum of money between eighty and a hundred and sixty pounds. Anyone who has lost such a sum should apply to the phone number below.' This note would link the lives of a number of very different people each with their obsessions, problems and dreams and despairs. And through it all the hectic life of Portobello would bustle on.	2008-11-20	Hutchinson						ZZZ000000

He also offers wise advice on everything from speed limits: 'From long experience of touring in Britain and abroad I should say that an average speed of 20 miles per hour is a sound allowance' to new technology: 'In wet weather one of the chief annoyances to the driver is an obscured wind-screen. There are highly efficient automatic wind-screen wipers on the market.'

9780091931254	Inside the Kingdom,Kings, Clerics, Modernists, Terrorists, and the Struggle for Saudi Arabia	Robert Lacey		Saudi Arabia is a country defined by paradox: it sits atop some of the richest oil deposits in the world, and yet the country s roiling disaffection produced sixteen of the nineteen 9/11 hijackers. It is a modern state, driven by contemporary technology, and yet its powerful religious establishment would have its customs and practices rolled back to match those of the Prophet Muhammed over a thousand years ago. In a world where events in the Middle East continue to have geopolitical consequences far beyond the region s boundaries, an understanding of this complex nation is essential. With Inside the Kingdom, British journalist and bestselling author Robert Lacey has given us one of the most penetrating and insightful looks at Saudi Arabia ever produced. More than twenty years after he first moved to the country to write about the Saudis at the end of the oil boom, Lacey has returned to find out how the consequences of the boom produced a society at war with itself. Filled with stories told by a broad range of Saudis, from high princes and ambassadors to men and women on the street, Inside the Kingdom is in many ways the story of the Saudis in their own words. It is a story of oil money that opened the door to Western ways, and produced a conservative backlash with effects that are still being felt today. It is a story of kings and princes who worried more about keeping power than the dangerous consequences of empowering radical clerics. It is a story of men who challenged orthodoxy and risked prison or death in the name of furthering open society, and of women who defied laws saying they should not write, drive, or play sports. And, at its heart, it is a story of a people attempting to reconcile the religious separatism of the past and the rapidly changing world with which they are increasingly intertwined. Their success or failure will have powerful reverberations in their own country, and across the globe.	2009	Random House						ZZZ000000

One of the world's biggest and most successful banks, its downfall was the event that sparked the slide of the world economy toward a Great Depression II.This is the gripping inside story of the dark characters who ruled Lehman, who refused to heed warnings that the company was headed for an iceberg: the world-class, mid-level people who valiantly fought to get Lehman off its disastrous course; the crash that didn't have to happen. A news-breaking explanation that answers the question everyone still asks: "why did it happen?"Larry McDonald, a former vice-president at Lehman Brothers in charge of distressed debt trading and convertible securities, was right at the center of the meltdown of the company and gives an intimate look at the mad house that Lehman became. This book shows beyond a doubt that Richard Fuld, the long-time CEO of Lehman, and his top executives, were totally out to lunch, allowing Lehman's risk profile to reach gargantuan proportions. While the traders, like Larry McDonald, clearly predicated more than two years in advance that the market for packaged subprime mortgages and credit default swaps would evaporate, the high-flying Lehman bosses pushed hard on the gas pedal until the very end.	2009	Ebury Press						ZZZ000000

9780099238225	Darwin & evolution	Paul Strathern		Charles Darwin's formulation of the theory of evolution with its now common place central idea of the 'survival of the fittest' is today-if not fully proven - generally accepted as logical and self-evident. Yet at the time, his revolutionary work ON THE ORIGIN OF SPECIES and the notion that mankind was just another step in an evolving process of survival and selection were shocking. This new concept challenged humanity's ingrained historical view that people were both at the centre of and superior to everything else in the natural world. Charles Darwin was to force a leap in human understanding, causing our horizons to shift and expand. So why was his 'big idea' so unacceptable to those arond him? And why was Darwin reluctant to publish his thoughts? DARWIN & EVOLUTION presents a brilliant snapshot of Darwin's life and work, and gives a clear and accessible explanation of the meaning and importance of the theory of evolution, and its implications for the world we live in today.	1998	Arrow						ZZZ000000

Now with a new introduction by Paul Theroux, "Journey Without Maps" is the spellbinding record of Greeneas journey. Crossing the red-clay terrain from Sierra Leone to the coast of Grand Bassa with a chain of porters, he came to know one of the few areas of Africa untouched by colonization. Western civilization had not yet impinged on either the human psyche or the social structure, and neither poverty, disease, nor hunger seemed able to quell the native spirit.

9780099284826	Disgrace	J. M. Coetzee		A divorced, middle-aged English professor finds himself increasingly unable to resist affairs with his female students. When discovered by the college authorities, he is expected to apologise and repent in an effort to save his job, but he refuses to become a scapegoat in what he see as as a show trial designed to reinforce a stringent political correctness. He preempts the authorities and leaves his job, and the city, to spend time with his grown-up lesbian daughter on her remote farm. Things between them are strained - there is much from the past they need to reconcile - and the situation becomes critical when they are the victims of a brutal and horrifying attack. In spectacularly powerful and lucid prose, Coetzee uses all his formidable skills to engage with a post-apartheid culture in unexpected and revealing ways. This examination into the sexual and politcal lawlines of modern South Africa as it tries desperately to start a fresh page in its history is chilling, uncompromising and unforgettable.	2000-06-04	Vintage						ZZZ000000

9780099422563	Venice,Pure City	Peter Ackroyd		Peter Ackroyd at his most magical and magisterial -- a glittering, evocative, fascinating, story-filled portrait of Venice. In this sumptuous vision of Venice, Peter Ackroyd turns his unparalleled skill at evoking place from London and the River Thames, to Italy and the city of myth, mystery and beauty, set like a jewel in its glistening lagoon. His account is at once romantic and packed with facts, conjuring up the atmosphere of the canals, bridges and sunlit squares, the churches and the markets, the fiestas and the flowers. He leads us through the history of the city, from the first refugees arrivingin the mists of the lagoon in the fourth century to the rise of a great mercantile state and a trading empire, the wars against Napoleon and the tourist invasions of today. Everything is here: the merchants on the Rialto and the Jews in the ghetto; the mosaics of St Mark's and the glass blowers of Murano; the carnival masks and the sad colonies of lepers; the doges and the destitute and the artists with their passion for colour and form -- Bellini, Titian, Tintoretto, Tiepolo. There are wars and sieges, scandals and seductions, fountains playing in deserted squares and crowds thronging the markets. And there is a dark undertone too, of shadowy corners and dead ends, prisons and punishment. The language and way of thinking of the Venetians sets them aside from the rest of Italy. They are an island people, linked to the sea and to the tides rather than the land. 'The moon rules Venice,' Ackroyd writes: 'It is built on ocean shells and ocean ground; it has the aspect of infinity. It is the floating world... changing and variable and accidental.'This book, like a magic gondola, transports its readers to that sensual, surprising realm. We could have no better guide -- reading Ackroyd'sVeniceis, in itself, a glorious journey and the perfect holiday.	2010-09-01	Random House UK						HIS000000

9780099458067	Branded,the buying and selling of teenagers	Alissa Quart		Did you know you're being brainwashed? Corporations spend billions of dollars annually to woo teen and pre-teen consumers, but today's efforts to control young minds and wattles take marketing strategies to a dangerous new level. Alissa Quart's incisive expose takes the reader to the dark side of teen marketing, revealing an aggressive and disturbing world in which adults build careers out in insinuating themselves into 'friendships' with young people in order to monitor what they wear, eat, listen to, and talk about with each other. From the 20-somethings who walk the streets looking for 'teen cool' to the marketing teams behind the scenes in the corporate effort to 'sponsor' schools, Quart introduces us to the most threatening of these initiatives. This compelling book discovers how teens succumb to content commercial battering designed to reduce their individuality and creativity, the effects on targeted messages on emerging teen identities and how they are subtly taught to market to each other. But we also witness the bravery of isolated young people who fight back, turning the tables on the cocksure mega-corporations striving to crack the codes of 'teen cool'. These kids prove it isn't necessary to give in to branding, but its a drop in the ocean when an entire generation is being raised to consume.	2003	Arrow						ZZZ000000

Such phrases as 'heart of darkness' and 'The horror! The horror!' have entered the language, often cited without an awareness of their original contexts. His popular legacy extends to Latin American fiction, to the spy novel, to the terrorist and anarchist character, and to film. The writers he has influenced range from T. S. Eliot to William Faulkner to V. S. Naipaul and John Le Carre. For a writer of 'difficult' fiction he has enjoyed a remarkably wide impact, yet as Marlow proclaims in Lord Jim of the figure whose story he tells, 'he was one of us' and so Conrad remains in fascinating ways.	2008-09-02	Arrow						ZZZ000000
9780099478966	VOODOO HISTORIES	David Aaronovitch		Our age is obsessed by the idea of conspiracy. We see it everywhere - from Pearl Harbour to 9/11, from the assassination of Kennedy to the death of Diana. Bookshop shelves threaten to collapse under the weight of texts devoted to proving myriad conspiracy theories true, while even quality newspapers and serious TV channels are prepared to give them credence. For David Aaronovitch, there came a time when he started to see a pattern. These theories used similar dodgy methods with which to insinuate their claims: they linked themselves to the supposed conspiracies of the past (it happened then so it can happen now); they carefully manipulated their evidence to hide its holes; they relied on the authority of dubious academic sources. Most importantly, they elevated their believers to membership of an elite - a group of people able to see beyond lies to a higher reality. But why believe something that entails stretching the bounds of probability so far? Surely it is more likely that men did actually land on the moon in 1969 than that thousands of people were enlisted to fabricate a deception that they did. In this entertaining and enlightening book - aimed to provide ammunition for those who have found themselves at the wrong end of a conversation about moon landings or twin towers - Aaronovitch carefully probes and explodes a dozen of the major conspiracy theories. In doing so, he looks at why people believe them, and makes an argument for a true scepticism: one based on a thorough knowledge of history and a strong dose of common sense.	2010	Vintage Books-uk						HIS000000

Each illuminates the complexity and drama that lie behind the simple notions of haplessness that have been used to explain the tragedy of their lives.

9780099492986	I Believe in Yesterday,My Adventures in Living History	Tim Moore		An odyssey through 2,000 years of filth and fury where the nights were black, the world was your outside toilet and everything tasted faintly of leeks. In 1989, Tim Moore moved into the last house in Chiswick with an outside toilet. Intrigued by a subsequent encounter with an elderly former resident, and shamed into confessing the phobic haste with which he demolished this facility, he finds himself inspired to travel back to the land before now, experiencing the horny-handed hardships and homespun pleasures enjoyed and endured by Moores gone by. The journey takes him into the world of historical re-enactment, sitting at the bare and grubby feet of retromaniacs who have seen their future in the past. Living on bramble leaves, Johnny cake and porridge, Moore travels from the Iron Age to the Steam Age. He shares straw beds and daft hats with period obsessives driven by socio-historical curiosity, disillusionment with the pampered fecklessness of the modern world, or a simple nostalgia for campfires, flatulence and brutality. Along the way he meets living historians for whom authenticity means pulling their own teeth out, and those who stride back through time with a Nokia and a packet of fags stuffed down their codpiece.	2009-08-25	Random House UK						ZZZ000000

9780099494287	Blood River,A Journey to Africa's Broken Heart	Tim Butcher		A compulsively readable account of a journey to the Congo a country virtually inaccessible to the outside world vividly told by a daring and adventurous journalist. Ever since Stanley first charted its mighty river in the 1870s, the Congo has epitomized the dark and turbulent history of a failed continent. However, its troubles only served to increase the interest of Daily Telegraph correspondent Tim Butcher, who was sent to cover Africa in 2000. Before long he became obsessed with the idea of recreating Stanley's original expedition but travelling alone. Despite warnings Butcher spent years poring over colonial-era maps and wooing rebel leaders before making his will and venturing to the Congo's eastern border. He passed through once thriving cities of this country and saw the marks left behind by years of abuse and misrule. Almost, 2,500 harrowing miles later, he reached the Atlantic Ocean, a thinner and a wiser man. Butcher's journey was a remarkable feat. But the story of the Congo, vividly told in Blood River, is more remarkable still. From the Hardcover edition.	2008-05-27	Vintage						ZZZ000000

9780099501480	China Witness,Voices from a Silent Generation	Xinran		Now available in paperback. In 1912, 5,000 years of feudal rule ended in China. Warlords, Western businessmen, soldiers, missionaries, and Japanese all ruled China, exploited, and fought one another, and the Chinese. In 1949, Mao Zedong came to power.... CHINA WITNESS is the personal testimony of a generation whose stories have not yet been told. Here the grandparents and great-grandparents of today sum up in their own words - for the first and perhaps the last time - the vast changes that have overtaken China's people over a century. The book is at once a journey by the author through time and place, and a memorial to those who have lived through war and civil war, persecution, invasion, revolution, famine, modernization, Westernization - and have survived into the 21st century. We meet everyday heroes, now in their seventies, eighties and nineties, from across this vast country - a herb woman at a market, retired teachers, a legendary 'double-gun woman', Red Guards, oil pioneers, an acrobat, a naval general, a shoe-mender, a lantern maker, taxi drivers, and more. Xinran travelled from west to east, between the Yellow River and the Yangtze, from the cities to the remote countryside of her homeland. She met and talked with a reticent generation, amongst whom the idea of collective guilt is deeply rooted, and freedom of speech can be a dangerous and unfamiliar concept. They spoke to her about their lives, their private hopes, fears and struggles, about what they witnessed and what they felt - about everything from the Long March to oil pipelines, from land reform to folk medicine, from Mao to marriage.Together their stories paint an unprecedented, intimate portrait of this vast and powerful country and its people. In such a rapidly changing world its aim, as Xinran says, is 'to help our future understand our past'. In 1912, 5,000 years of feudal rule ended in China. Warlords, Western businessmen, soldiers, missionaries, and Japanese all ruled China, exploited, and fought one another, and the Chinese.

The Li sisters don t have much education, but one thing has been drummed into them: their mother is a failure because she hasn t managed to produce a son, and they themselves only merit a number as a name. Women, their father tells them, are like chopsticks: utilitarian and easily broken. Men, on the other hand, are the strong rafters that hold up the roof of a house. Yet when circumstances lead the sisters to seek work in distant Nanjing, the shocking new urban environment opens their eyes. While Three contributes to the success of a small fast-food restaurant, Five and Six learn new talents at a health spa and a bookshop/tearoom. And when the money they earn starts arriving back at the village, their father is forced to recognise that daughters are not so dispensable after all. Xinran has become known for her wonderful ability to take readers to the heart of Chinese society. In this new book she tells not only a human story, but the story of a city. As the Li sisters discover Nanjing, so do we: its past, its customs and culture, and its future as a place where people can change their lives.	2008-07	Random House						FIC000000

9780099502920	James Bond,The Authorised Biography	John Pearson		The story of the man behind the myth, the most famous spy of all time James Bond. It was a strong face, certainly the eyes pale grey and very cold, the mouth was hard, and the dark hair grey-streaked now still fell in the authentic comma over the forehead. This is how John Pearson reacted to his first encounter with the real James Bond. At the time, like most of the world, he assumed that James Bond was nothing more than a character in Fleming's highly charged imagination. Then he began to have his doubts, doubts of such a pitch that the British secret service was trying to warn him off the scene. Despite this, he finally became convinced that James Bond was not only real, but actually alive. Pearson went on to write the bestselling authorized biography of Ian Fleming. Then, thanks to a change in policy within the secret service he was invited to embark upon a companion volume to his life of Fleming. This resulting book is bound to become one of the most extraordinary biographies of our times the authorized life of a myth the official biography of James Bond. The biography reveals situations and incidents only hinted at in Ian Fleming's books; and it promises to reveal a side of Bond never seen before: the story of his life, theBonds of Glencoe; the night he lost his wallet and his virginity in Paris; his first assignment; his duel with the S.S.; his women, scandals and tastes it's all here, for the first time ever.	2008-06-03	Arrow Books						ZZZ000000

9780099505440	Higher Than the Eagle Soars	Stephen Venables		Higher Than the Eagle Soarsdistills "the intense essence" of his Everest climb, concentrating on the drama of the final climb and nightmarish descent. It is an intimate and epic account of an event that confirmed Venables as the greatest British climber of his generation. I have been wanting for some time now to revisit the Everest climb. Although the book I wrote about it [Everest: Alone at the Summit] was very successful and has appeared in four different editions, it conformed superficially to an "expedition book," telling the whole story from beginning to end, with considerable technical detail. It would be good to go back and extract the intense essence of the story, concentrating on the drama of the final climb and nightmarish descent, making a grand finale to the book. Although Everest wasn't the end of my climbing career, it was a big turning point: it had quelled the demon of ambition and I sensed that I would probably never do anything quite so extreme in the mountains. And, although we didn't go seeking deliberately an epic near-death experience, it did turn out that way the ultimate endurance test for which all the previous adventures seemed, retrospectively, to be a preparation.	2008-10-07	Arrow						ZZZ000000

The discovery of a stab wound in his stomach extinguishes any hope that this was a tragic accident. Erlendur and his team embark on their investigation with little to go on but the news that the boy's Thai half-brother is missing. Is he implicated, or simply afraid for his own life? The investigation soon unearths tensions simmering beneath the surface of Iceland's outwardly liberal, multicultural society. A teacher at the boy's school makes no secret of his anti-immigration stance; incidents are reported between Icelandic pupils and the disaffected children of incomers; and, to confuse matters further, a suspected paedophile has been spotted in the area. Meanwhile, the boy's murder forces Erlendur to confront the tragedy in his own past.

9780099507895	Being Shelley,The Poet's Search for Himself	Ann Wroe		This book takes the life of one of England's greatest poets and turns it inside out. Rather than following a daily round in which poetry erupts occasionally, it tracks the inner adventures of a spirit struggling to escape and create. This is the life of the poet, rather than the man. Four questions consumed Shelley and coloured everything he wrote. Who, or what, was he? What was his purpose? Where had he come from? And where was he going? He sought the answers in order to free and empower not only himself, but the whole human race. His revolution would shatter the earth's illusions, shock men and women with new visions, find true Love and Liberty ' and take everyone with him. Now, for the first time, this passionate and radical quest is put at the centre of Shelley's life. The result is a spiritual journey that is as dangerous and exhilarating as it is astonishing. This is Shelley as he has never been seen before.	2008-07-03	VINTAGE						ZZZ000000
9780099509592	Giving,How Each of Us Can Change the World	Bill Clinton		Here, from Bill Clinton, is a call to action.Givingis an inspiring look at how each of us can change the world. First, it reveals the extraordinary and innovative efforts now being made by companies and organizationsand by individualsto solve problems and save lives both "down the street and around the world." Then it urges us to seek out what each of us, "regardless of income, available time, age, and skills," can do to help, to give people a chance to live out their dreams. Bill Clinton shares his own experiences and those of other givers, representing a global flood tide of nongovernmental, nonprofit activity. These remarkable stories demonstrate that gifts of time, skills, things, and ideas are as important and effective as contributions of money. From Bill and Melinda Gates to a six-year-old California girl named McKenzie Steiner, who organized and supervised drives to clean up the beach in her community, Clinton introduces us to both well-known and unknown heroes of giving. Among them: Dr. Paul Farmer, who grew up living in the family bus in a trailer park, vowed to devote his life to giving high-quality medical care to the poor and has built innovative public health-care clinics first in Haiti and then in Rwanda; a New York couple, in Africa for a wedding, who visited several schools in Zimbabwe and were appalled by the absence of textbooks and school supplies. They founded their own organization to gather and ship materials to thirty-five schools. After three years, the percentage of seventh-graders who pass reading tests increased from 5 percent to 60 percent;' Oseola McCarty, who after seventy-five years of eking out a living by washing and ironing, gave $150,000 to the University of Southern Mississippi to endow a scholarship fund for African-American students; Andre Agassi, who has created a college preparatory academy in the Las Vegas neighborhood with the city's highest percentage of at-risk kids. "Tennis was a stepping-stone for me," says Agassi. "Changing a child's life is what I always wanted to do"; Heifer International, which gave twelve goats to a Ugandan village. Within a year, Beatrice Biira's mother had earned enough money selling goat's milk to pay Beatrice's school fees and eventually to send all her children to schooland, as required, to pass on a baby goat to another family, thus multiplying the impact of the gift. Clinton writes about men and women who traded in their corporate careers, and the fulfillment they now experience through giving. He writes about energy-efficient practices, about progressive companies going green, about promoting fair wages and decent working conditions around the world. He shows us how one of the most important ways of giving can be an effort to change, improve, or protect a government policy. He outlines what we as individuals can do, the steps we can take, how much we should consider giving, and why our giving is so important. Bill Clinton's own actions in his post-presidential years have had an enormous impact on the lives of millions. Through his foundation and his work in the aftermath of the Asian tsunami and Hurricane Katrina, he has become an international spokesperson and model for the power of giving. "We all have the capacity to do great things," President Clinton says. "My hope is that the people and stories in this book will lift spirits, touch hearts, and demonstrate that citizen activism and service can be a powerful agent of change in the world."

9780099513353	Dreams of Rivers and Seas	Tim Parks		For some time now, I have been plagued, perhaps blessed, by dreams of rivers and seas, dreams of water.' Just days after Albert James writes these lines to his son John, in London, he is dead. Abandoning a pretty girlfriend and the lab where he is completing his PhD, John flies to Delhi to join his mother in mourning. A brilliant and controversial anthropologist, the nature of Albert James s research, and the circumstances of his death, are far from clear. On top of this, John must confront his mother s coolness, and the strangeness of the cremation ceremony that she has organised for his father. No sooner is the body consigned to the flames than a journalist arrives, determined to write a biography of the dead man. The widow will have nothing to do with the project, yet seems incapable of keeping away from the journalist. In Tim Parks s masterly new novel, India, with its vast strangeness, the density and intensity of its street life, its indifference to all distinctions between the religious and the secular, is a constant source of distraction to these westerners in search of clarity and identity. To John, the enigma of his father s dreams of rivers and seas appears to be one with the greater mystery of the country.	2009	Random House						FIC027000
9780099514299	Spearhead Assault,Blood, Guts and Glory on the Falklands Frontlines	John Geddes		On May 21st, 1982, nearly four hundred soldiers from the 2cd Battalion Parachute Regiment under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Herbert 'H' Jones, landed with a British Task Force at San Carlos Bay on the Falklands. Their mission: to take the strategic position at Goose Green where military intelligence reckoned there were a couple of hundred Argentine troops guarding an airstrip.The intelligence was wrong and when they attacked on May 27th, they were confronted by a 1,500-strong regiment of Argentine soldiers dug in with so much machine-gun ammunition they stood on the ammo boxes to keep their feet dry. Some of the enemy soldiers were Special Forces; some were Guarani Indians, a proud warrior race; a few even were Welsh-speaking members of a community founded in Patagoina in the nineteenth century. What they had in common were two .50 calibre machine guns in every position. It was going to be a hard and dreadful fight. Fourteen hours later when the smoke had cleared on the most ferocious battle in post-war British history, nearly 250 Argentine soldiers were killed, scores more were wounded and another 1,300 had been captured. Goose Green would cost 2 Para the lives of seventeen men, including 'H' Jones, who was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross for his role in the action. This is a no-holds barred account of what it was really like to walk into the storm of lead the Argentines hurled at their attackers.	2008-05-01	Arrow						ZZZ000000
9780099516194	Diary of a bad year	J. M. Coetzee		An eminent, seventy-two-year-old Australian writer is invited to contribute to a book entitled Strong Opinions. It is a chance to air some urgent concerns. He writes short essays on the origins of the state, on Machiavelli, on anarchism, on al Qaida, on intelligent design, on music. What, he asks, is the origin of the state and the nature of the relationship between citizen and state? How should the citizen of a modern democracy react to the state s willingness to set aside moral considerations and civil liberties in its war on terror, a war that includes the use of torture? He is troubled by Australia s complicity with America and Britain in their wars in the Middle East; an obscure sense of dishonour clings to him. In the laundry-room of his apartment block he encounters an alluring young woman. When he discovers she is between jobs he claims failing eyesight and offers her work typing up his manuscript. Anya has no interest in politics but the job provides a distraction, as does the writer s evident and not unwelcome attraction toward her. Her boyfriend, Alan, an investment consultant who understands the world in harsh neo-liberal economic terms, has reservations about his trophy girlfriend spending time with this 1960s throwback. Taking a lively interest in his affairs, Alan begins to formulate a plan.	2008	Vintage Books						ZZZ000000

When did these corporate values overtake civic responsibilites? Rushkoff examines how corporatism has become an intrinsic part of our everyday lives, choices and opinions, how this system has conquered through total inclusion in a world where everything can be commodified, where communities have dissolved into consumer groups, where fiction and reality have become fundamentally blurred. And, with this system on the verge of collapse, Rushkoff shows how the simple pleasures that make us human can also point the way to freedom.	2010	Random House						ZZZ000000

In The Talent Code, award-winning journalist Daniel Coyle draws on cutting-edge research to reveal that, far from being some abstract mystical power fixed at birth, ability really can be created and nurtured. In the process, he considers talent at work in venues as diverse as a music school in Dallas and a tennis academy near Moscow, to demostrate how the wiring of our brains can be transformed by the way we approach particular tasks. He explains what is really going on when apparently unremarkable people suddenly make a major leap forward. He reveals why some teaching methods are so much more effective than others. Above all, he shows how all of us can achieve our full potential if we set about training our brains in the right way.	2010-05-03	ARROW						ZZZ000000

But the collapse of twenty years of Republican conservativism means the country is already conducting an intense self-examination about the trajectory of its history; how it came to find itself in multiple crises and how an America that began as 'the last best hope for mankind' came to be so suspected and vilified around much of the world. * The American Future: A History, written by an author who has spent half his life there, takes the long view of how the United States has come to this anguished moment of truth about its own identity as a nation and its place in the world. * In each of the chapters devoted to the most compelling issues facing Americans now the projection of power ("American war") ; race, immigration and the problematic promise of e pluribus unum ("American skin"); the intensity of religious conviction in public life ("American fervour") ; the mystique of American land ("American Space") and its battles with the imperatives of profit - Schama traces the deep history of the present crisis. * Cumulatively the chapters build into a history of American exceptionalism the 'American difference' that means so much to its people but which has led it into calamities as well as triumphs. * The American Future: A History argues that if you want to know what is truly at stake, you need to absorb these stories and understand this history for understanding is the condition of hope.	2009-07-02	Vintage						ZZZ000000

9780099522638	Butcher and Bolt	David Loyn		Afghanistan has been a strategic prize for foreign empires for more than two-hundred years. The British, Russians and Americans have all fought across its beautiful and inhospitable terrain, in conflicts variously ruthless, misguided and bloody. A century ago, the common sneer about how British soldiers treated Afghan tribesmen was that they would "butcher" them, then "bolt." This violent history is the subject of David Loyn's magisterial book. He begins with the first British mission exactly two hundred years ago that ushered in a history of conflict littered with misunderstandings and broken promises, in which the British, the Russians and later the Americans, constantly under-estimated the ability of the Afghans and the power of the Frontier tribes. Butcher & Bolt brilliantly brings to life the personalities involved in Afghanistan's relationship with the world, chronicling the misunderstandings and missed opportunities that have so often led to war. Coming right up to date, it draws on David Loyn's unrivalled knowledge of the Taliban today and the forces that currently prevail in Afghanistan, to provide the definitive analysis of the lessons these conflicts have for the present day.

9780099524045	Reckless,The Rise and Fall of the City	Philip Augar		In 1997 it seemed that things in the City could only get better. The incoming Labour government gave the Bank of England independence, it introduced a state of the art system of light-touch regulation; and it signalled that it was happy to see finance let rip. For ten years everything went according to plan. Buoyed by a strong pound and cheered on by an excitable media, the bankers became the heroes of the age. The City embarked on a giddy programme of innovation, asset prices boomed and Britain seemed at last to have shaken off its post-war malaise. Politicians took to lecturing their European counterparts on the need to deregulate, to focus on shareholder value and to dispense with an outdated and discredited social market model. And then in the summer of 2007 everything began to collapse. One household name after another ndash; Northern Rock, Bradford & Bingley, HBOS ndash; failed or was forcibly merged. Barely a year later the government took controlling stakes in the banking sector and the reputation of the City was in tatters. In Chasing Alpha Philip Augar tells the extraordinary story of how a major economy tried to reinvent itself as a hedge fund crossed with an offshore tax haven. It is all here: the greed, the guile, the excess. Anyone who worked in finance, and anyone who watched the disaster unfold, will be riveted by this, the first sober history of an intoxicated decade.	2010-04-01	Random House						ZZZ000000

Meyers offers an incisive account of the making and meaning of The Misfits, which destroyed their marriage.

9780099530374	The Worst Journey in the World	Apsley Cherry-Garrard		"Polar exploration is at once the cleanest and most isolated way of having a bad time that has ever been devised" wrote Apsley Cherry-Garrard in a deceptively jaunty introduction to this classic story of bravery and fortitude first published in 1922. The story he relates is of Scott's last expedition to the Antarctic. From its departure from England in 1910 to its arrival in New Zealand in 1913, it is one of the most famous and tragic in the annals of exploration. Driven by an obsession for scientific knowledge, these brave polar explorers embarked on a journey into the unknown, testing their endurance by pushing themselves to the ultimate physical and mental limits as they surveyed the striking and mammoth land that lay far to the south.Cherry-Garrard was himself a member of the expedition that had two goals: to discover as much as was scientifically possible about the terrain and habitat of Antarctica, and to be the first to reach the South Pole. The party was plagued by bad luck, weather conditions of unanticipated ferocity, and the physical deterioration of the party on the last part of the journey. Confronted by the shattering knowledge that Roald Amundsen had reached the South Pole a month before them, Scott's party then had to negotiate the last, heroic part of their journey, a doomed attempt which has entered modern mythology.The Worst Journey in the World is the inside story of this most famous of journeys and is truly one of the best and most moving books of travel ever written. Join Scott's expedition as he and his team venture deep into the frozen unknown. This volume is the second in the continuing series of Explorers Club Classic books.	2010	Random House UK						ZZZ000000
9780099531821	Nature Cure	Richard Mabey		In the last year of the old millennium, Richard Mabey, Britain's foremost nature writer, fell into a severe depression. For two years,he did little more than lie in bed with his face to a wall. He could neither work nor play. His money ran out. Worst of all, the natural world - which since childhood had been a source of joy and inspiration for him - became meaningless. Then, cared for by friends, he gradually recovered. He fell in love. Out of necessity as much as choice he moved to East Anglia. And he started to write again. This remarkable book is an account of that first year of a new life. It is the story of a rite of passage -from sickness into health, from retreat into curiosity. It is about the adventure of learning to fit again. Having left the cosseting woods of the Chiltern hills for the open flatlands of Norfolk, Richard Mabey finds exhilaration in discovering a whole new landscape. He writes about the changing seasons in prose so exact andso beautiful that every sentence delights the reader. But Nature Cure is also alarger story. In finding his own niche, Richard Mabey gained insights into our human place in nature. He reflects on the inherent value of all creatures; on our presumptions that mankind is superior; on the ancient morality of commonland; and above all on the role of the imagination -not as a barrier between us and nature, but as our best way back to it. This was his 'nature cure': not a passive submission to nature, but anactive, sensual re-engagement.	2008-06-19	Random House						ZZZ000000

9780099532422	Henry VIII,The King and His Court	Alison Weir		'This magnificent new book is Alison Weir's greatest achievement: a detailed biography of Henry VIII, set against the cultural, social and political background of his court - the most magnificent court ever seen in England - and the splendour of his many sumptuous palaces. Seen from this new perspective, Henry VIII emerges as a fully-rounded and realistic personality, not the two-dimensional caricature of popular misconception. This book is not just an entertaining narrative packed with colourful description and a wealth of anecdotal evidence, but a comprehensive analytical study of the development of both monarch and court during a crucial period in English history. As well as challenging some recent theories, it offers controversial new conclusions based on contemporary evidence that has until now been overlooked. This is a triumph of historical writing which will appeal equally to the general reader and the serious historian.'A glittering evocation of the Tudor Court, its splendour as well as its vulgarity-a responsive, rounded portrait.' Daily Telegraph'Weir has used colourful, fresh material (much of it from unpublished archives and letters), to recreate early sixteenth-century European life and thought, within which she sets the larger-than-life figure of the king-a compelling, readable account of the life and times of the king who put England firmly on the map of power politics.'

9780099532538	What I Talk About When I Talk About Running	Haruki Murakami		In 1982, having sold his jazz bar to devote himself to writing, Murakami began running to keep fit. A year later, he d completed a solo course from Athens to Marathon, and now, after dozens of such races, not to mention triathlons and a slew of critically acclaimed books, he reflects upon the influence the sport has had on his life and on his writing. Equal parts travelogue, training log, and reminiscence, this revealing memoir covers his four-month preparation for the 2005 New York City Marathon and settings ranging from Tokyo s Jingu Gaien gardens, where he once shared the course with an Olympian, to the Charles River in Boston among young women who outpace him. Through this marvellous lens of sport emerges a cornucopia of memories and insights: the eureka moment when he decided to become a writer, his greatest triumphs and disappointments, his passion for vintage LPs, and the experience, after fifty, of seeing his race times improve and then fall back. By turns funny and sobering, playful and philosophical, What I Talk About When I Talk About Running is rich and revealing, both for fans of this masterful yet private writer and for the exploding population of athletes who find similar satisfaction in distance running.	2009-04	Random House UK Ltd						ZZZ000000

9780099534020	After Mandela,The Battle for the Soul of South Africa	Alec Russell		"A brisk, lively and vividly written portrait of post-apartheid South Africa" Peter Godwin, author of MukiwaIn the early 1990s, the African National Congress, led by Nelson Mandela, engaged in a historic and peaceful transition to power in South Africa. For some, the story of South Africa ended with that moment - the victory of the ANC over the bitter injustice of the apartheid regime, and Mandela's astonishing mission of reconciliation. Yet while the economy has grown steadily, as has a fledgling middle class, and black South Africans have attained positions of great wealth and power, rampant inequality still remains. Violence is endemic in the townships and in the major cities. Race relations are fraught as whites struggle to find their place in the new order. President Thabo Mbeki's denial of the AIDS epidemic has led to tens of thousands of unnecessary deaths and been morally and politically disastrous. Mbeki's failure to check the abuses of Robert Mugabe's dictatorship in Zimbabwe has tarnished South Africa's reputation abroad and baffled Mbeki's former friends.South Africa should be the continents greatest hope, yet it stands at a crossroads as it faces its most serious test since the end of white rule. Uncertainty over its trajectory intensified with the election of Jacob Zuma, a charismatic populist who is embroiled in a corruption scandal, as Mandelas second successor as leader of the ANC, in 2007. This controversial choice unleashed turmoil within Africas grandest liberation movement. Might it also signal the start of an unhappy new chapter in the post-apartheid story? The collapse of neighbouring Zimbabwe is a chilling example of how a revolutionary party can ossify in power and lose sight of its ideals. The journey from Mandela to Zuma is a political and moral epic, populated with extraordinary characters, and with the fate of South Africa at its coreIn this expertly researched and beautifully told account, award-winning journalist Alec Russell draws on his deep knowledge of South Africa and his relationships with its most important figures - Mbeki, Zuma, Archbishop Desmond Tutu and of course Mandela himself - to address the questions facing the nation. At a turbulent time for many African countries as they emerge into the second phase of the post-independence era, this book will have a wide appeal for Africa-watchers everywhere.	2010-05-06	Random House						HIS001000

9780099535331	A Mercy	Toni Morrison		A powerful tragedy distilled into a jewel of a masterpiece by the Nobel Prize-winning author of Beloved and, almost like a prelude to that story, set two centuries earlier. In the 1680s the slave trade was still in its infancy. In the Americas, virulent religious and class divisions, prejudice and oppression were rife, providing the fertile soil in which slavery and race hatred were planted and took root. Jacob is an Anglo-Dutch trader and adventurer, with a small holding in the harsh north. Despite his distaste for dealing in flesh, he takes a small slave girl in part payment for a bad debt from a plantation owner in Catholic Maryland. This is Florens, with the hands of a slave and the feet of a Portuguese lady. Florens looks for love, first from Lina, an older servant woman at her new master's house, but later from a handsome blacksmith, an African, never enslaved. There are other voices: Lina, whose tribe was decimated by smallpox; their mistress, Rebekka, herself a victim of religious intolerance back in England; Sorrow, a strange girl who spent her early years at sea; and finally the devastating voice of Florens' mother. These are all men and women inventing themselves in the wilderness. A Mercy reveals what lies beneath the surface of slavery. But at its heart it is the ambivalent, disturbing story of a mother who casts off her daughter in order to save her, and of a daughter who may never exorcise that abandonment. Acts of mercy may have unforeseen consequences.	2009-06-04	Random House UK Ltd						ZZZ000000

9780099543589	From a Clear Blue Sky,Surviving the Mountbatten Bomb	Timothy Knatchbull		On the August bank holiday weekend in 1979, 14-year-old Timothy Knatchbull went out on a boat trip off the shore of Mullaghmore in County Sligo, Ireland. It was a trip that would cost four lives u and change his own for ever. The IRA bomb that exploded in their boat killed Knatchbull's grandfather Lord Mountbatten, his grandmother Lady Brabourne, his twin brother Nicholas, and local teenager Paul Maxwell. In telling this story for the first time, Knatchbull is not only revisiting the terrible events he and his family lived through, but also writing an intensely personal account of human triumph over tragedy. For thirty years, Knatchbull has lived with the echoes of that day: the death of the twin from whom he had been inseparable; the loss of his adored grandparents, whose funerals along with his twin's he and his parents were too injured to attend; the recovery from physical wounds; and the emotional legacy that proved harder to endure. In From A Clear Blue Sky Timothy Knatchbull delves into his past, present and future, and reveals a story of courage and fortitude as he, his family, and their English and Irish friends dealt with the shocking assassinations and their aftermath. Taking place in Ireland at the height of the Troubles, it gives a compelling insight into that period of Irish history. But more importantly it brings home that although tragedy can strike at any moment, the human spirit is able to recover and evolve over time. This book about truth and reconciliation, unflinching in its detail, asks searching questions about why human beings inflict misery on others, and holds lessons about how we can learn to forgive, to heal and to move on. It will resonate with readers the world over.	2010	Random House						ZZZ000000

Uncomfortable heels + slippy floor + head turned by a cocktail dress = thwack. Arms stretched overhead, teeth cracking on floor tiles, chest and knees breaking the fall. It was theatrical, exaggerated, a perfect 6.0. And it was Significant Moment #1 in discovering that I had grade-three breast cancer.'

9780099548621	Elizabeth's Women,The Hidden Story of the Virgin Queen	Tracy Borman		Elizabeth I was born into a world of women.As a child, she was served by a predominantly female household of servants and governesses, with occasional visits from her mother, Anne Bolyen, and the wives who later took her place.As Queen, Elizabeth was constantly attended by ladies of the bedchamber and maids of honour who clothed her, bathed her and watched her while she ate.Among her family, it was her female relations who had the greatest influence: from her sister Mary, who distrusted and later imprisoned her, to her cousin, Mary, Queen of Scots, who posed a constant and dangerous threat to her crown for almost thirty years.Despite the importance of women in Elizabeths life, most historians and biographers have focused on her relationships with men.She has been portrayed as a mans woman who loved to flirt with the many ambitious young men who frequented her court.Yet it is the women in her life who provide the most fascinating insight into the character of this remarkable monarch.With them she was jealous, spiteful and cruel, as well as loyal, kind and protective.She showed her frailties and her insecurities, but also her considerable shrewdness and strength.In short, she was more human than the public persona she presented to the rest of the court. It is her relationships with women that hold the key to the private Elizabeth.In this original chronicling of the life of one of Englands greatest monarchs, historian Tracy Borman explores Elizabeths relationships with the key women in her life. Beginning with her mother and the governesses and stepmothers who cared for the young princess, including her beloved Kat Astley and the inspirational Katherine Parr, Elizabeths Women sheds new light on her formative years.Elizabeths turbulent relationships with her rivals are examined: from her sister, Bloody Mary, to the sisters of Lady Jane Grey, and finally the most deadly of all her rivals, Mary, Queen of Scots who would give birth to the man Elizabeth would finally, inevitably have to recognise as heir to her throne. It is a chronicle of the servants, friends and flouting wenches who brought out the best and the worst of Elizabeths carefully cultivated image as Gloriana, the Virgin Queen, in the glittering world of her court.	2010-07-01	Random House						HIS015000
9780099549178	King's Mistress, Queen's Servant,The Life and Times of Henrietta Howard	Tracy Borman		Henrietta Howard, later Countess of Suffolk, was the long-term mistress and confidante of King George II. Described by Swift as a consummate courtier who packed away her 'private virtuesa like cloaths in a chest', by Pope as 'so very reasonable, so unmov'd', and by the world at large as 'the Swiss' (due to her apparent neutrality), she remains as fascinating and perplexing today as she was for her contemporaries. Orphaned at the age of twelve after her mother died and her father was killed in a duel, and dragged into poverty by her brutal husband, Henrietta used her own ingenuity and determination to secure a role at the very heart of the royal court. Although renowned for her passivity and mildness, her relations with the Queen became increasingly acrimonious, and she made an enemy of Prime Minister Robert Walpole before eventually resigning her position amidst intense political scandal. As well as providing a fascinating insight into the dynamics of the Georgian court, Tracy Borman's wonderful biography	2010-05-15	Random House						ZZZ000000
9780099552222	The Greatest Traitor,The Life of Sir Roger Mortimer, 1st Earl of March	Ian Mortimer		One night in August 1323 a captive rebel baron, Sir Roger Mortimer, drugged his guards and escaped from the Tower of London. With the king's men-at-arms in pursuit he fled to the south coast, and sailed to France. There he was joined by Isabella, the Queen of England, who threw herself into his arms. A year later, as lovers, they returned with an invading army: King Edward II's forces crumbled before them, and Mortimer took power. He removed Edward II in the first deposition of a monarch in British history. Then the ex-king was apparently murdered, some said with a red-hot poker, in Berkeley Castle. Brutal, intelligent, passionate, profligate, imaginative and violent: Sir Roger Mortimer was an extraordinary character. It is not surprising that the queen lost her heart to him. Nor is it surprising that his contemporaries were terrified of him. But until now no one has appreciated the full evil genius of the man. This first biography reveals not only the man's career as a feudal lord, a governor of Ireland, a rebel leader and a dictator of England but also the truth of what happened that night in Berkeley Castle.	2010	Random House						ZZZ000000

9780224062756	The Long Road Home,The Aftermath of the Second World War	Ben Shephard		Surprisingly early in the Second World War u long before an Allied victory was assured u people began to plan for its aftermath. They were haunted by memories of what happened a generation before u when the millions of soldiers killed on the battlefields of the Great War had been eclipsed by the millions more civilians carried off by disease and starvation when the conflict was over. They were determined that this time around the ceasefire would not be followed by a civilian disaster. Confronted by an entire continent starving and uprooted, and with the help of a new UN body to aid the populations of Europe and Asia, Allied planners did not single out victims of the Nazi death camps for particular attention, but devised strategies to help all 'displaced persons' u as they had become known by 1943. Most of the fifteen million foreign labourers in Germany were speedily repatriated. But a million-and-a-half people u Jews, Poles, Ukrainians, Latvians, Lithuanians, Estonians and Yugoslavs u refused to go home. It took the Allies seven years to resolve this problem. They had to create the state of Israel, alter the whole basis of their immigration policy and let thousands of war criminals go free. This book offers a radical reassessment of the aftermath of World War II. Unlike most recent writing about the 1940s, it assesses the events and personalities of that decade in terms of contemporary standards and values. In particular, it shows that the tragic consequences of war were understood not in terms of genocide, but of displacement u of millions of people deprived of their homes and often forced to work for the Germans.	2010-01-07	Random House						ZZZ000000

9780224076104	The Second Plane,September 11, 2001-2007	Martin Amis		Martin Amis first wrote about September 11 a week later in a piece for The Guardian beginning, It was the advent of the second plane, sharking in low over the Statue of Liberty: that was the defining moment. In the years that passed since then, he has returned to the subject again and again, in reviews (of the film United 93 as well as books), essays and two remarkable short stories, In the Palace of the End and The Last Days of Muhammad Atta. All are collected here, together with his account of the time he spent shadowing Tony Blair for The Guardian.As Amis says in his introduction, If September 11 had to happen, I am not at all sorry that it happened in my lifetime. That day and what followed from it: this is a narrative of misery and pain, and also of desperate fascination. Geopolitics may not be my natural subject, but masculinity is. And have we ever seen the male idea in such outrageous garb as the robes, combat fatigues, suits and ties, jeans, tracksuits and medics smocks of the Islamic radical?	2008	Jonathan Cape						ZZZ000000
9780224079372	Holy warriors,a modern history of the Crusades	Jonathan Phillips		When George Bush inaugurated the War on Terror in 2001, he referred to it as a 'crusade'. A medieval Crusade could be defined thus: a holy war initiated by the Pope on God's behalf in which the participants took the cross and received remission for their sins. The First Crusade, launched in 1095, ushered in a period of almost 200 years of Christian rule in the Levant, yet over time crusades were directed against a variety of opponents, not just Muslims in the Middle East: against Cathar heretics, political enemies of the papacy, the Mongols, pagan tribes of northern Europe, and the Ottoman Turks, well into the sixteenth century. While the notion of fighting for one's faith fell into disrepute during the Enlightenment, whose proponents viewed the idea as primitive and barbaric, in reality the cultural engines of romanticism and orientalism gave the memory of the crusades a significant boost in the nineteenth century. The notion of moral right buttressed by royal authority helped to drive the expansion of European power through imperialism and colonialism, and in both World Wars the theme of crusading was used as a call to arms. As Jonathan Philips demonstrates in this timely and revealing study, crusading has proven to be a remarkably adaptable and long-lasting phenomenon, embedded in the actions and consciousness of the West for centuries. Unlike other histories of the Crusades this one firstly comes up to the present day and secondly, avoids a chronological slog through the whole movement. Instead it drills a series of bore holes into the key aspects and moments: The First Crusade, Richard the Lionheart and Saladin, the Templars, the Jihad, etc. Thirdly, it is incredibly vivid and accessible - we hear the swords, taste the food, see the sights and feel the heat.	2009-10-29	Bodley Head						ZZZ000000
9780224080576	The Numerati,How They'll Get My Number and Yours	Stephen Baker		In a world teeming with data, we ourselves become the math nerds' most prized specimens. In The Numerati Stephen Baker, a Business Week senior writer, takes us on a guided tour (no maths required) through an unprecedented new era, in which mathematicians are starting to map individual human behaviour what we do, who we are, how we work, chat, play and shop -- and in so doing, will change every aspect of our lives, from the kind of medical advice we get, to the adverts we see, to our appraisals at work, to the way politicians try to win our votes and protect us from terrorist attacks. There s the robotic librarian using a combination of algebra and geometry to analyse thousands of press articles and blog posts in English.Then there are the mathematicians helping to map out advertising campaigns, changing the nature of research in newsrooms and in biology labs, enabling marketers to forge new one-on-one relationships with customers. Baker asks the fundamental question: If long articles full of twists and turns can be reduced to a mathematical essence, what's next? Will the power of mathematicians to make sense of personal data and to model the behaviour of individuals inevitably erode privacy?More and more of the world economy is falling into the realm of numbers. The Numerati is a book about one of the great undertakings of the 21st century - the mathematical modelling of humanity. Much in the same way as neuroscientists are mapping our brains, mathematicians are mapping our individual behaviour -- everything that makes the individual distinct. Stephen Baker navigates us through a world that otherwise might seem remote or disconnected, but one which is absolutely relevant to our everyday lives.	2008-11-06	Jonathan Cape						ZZZ000000
9780224082259	Impellent Force,Water, Fire, and the Most Powerful Idea in the World	Bill Rosen		'The most important invention of the Industrial Revolution was invention itself.' Those words are at the heart of this remarkable book. The Most Powerful Idea in the World is more than a stunning history of the Industrial Revolution and the steam engine at its core. It is an amazing account of how inventors first came to own and profit from their ideasand how invention itself springs forth from logic and imagination.Rocket. It was the fortuitously-named train that inaugurated steam locomotion in 1829, jump-starting two centuries of mass transportation. As William Rosen reveals, it was the product of centuries of scientific and industrial discovery. From inventor Heron of Alexandria in 60 AD to James Watt, the physicist whose 'separate condenser' was central to the development of steam power, to businessman Matthew Boulton, who envisioned whole factories powered with Watts enginesall those who made possible the long ride towards the Industrial Revolution are brought to unforgettable life.But crucial to their contributions are other characters whose concepts allowed their inventions to flourish: John Locke, who conceived of what we now know as 'intellectual property', and Edward Coke, whose work led to the patent system that, as Abraham Lincoln said, 'added the fuel of interest to the fire of genius'. Along the way, Rosen takes us deep into the human mind, explaining, for example, how 'eureka' moments occurwhen the brain is most relaxed.Astonishingly erudite yet completely accessible, this is a superb and inspiring work about the experiments and accomplishments that led to a revolution, the effects of which still power and plague us today.	2009-05-27	Jonathan Cape Ltd						HIS037000
9780224082518	Arnie and Jack,Palmer, Nicklaus and Golf's Greatest Rivalry	Ian O'Connor		Jack Nicklaus and Arnold Palmer are two of the greatest golfers in history. In fact, its fair to say that between them with some help from Gary Player they created the game as we know it. Their rise inspired and coincided with golfs huge explosion in participation, in TV coverage, and in commercial terms. This dual biography tells the story of two men who at times loathed, resented, but in the end came to respect each other, and the way they changed an entire sport.Palmer, ten years Nicklauss senior, was an all-American hero. Blue-collar, charming, loved by fans, at the end of the 1950s it looked as though the King would dominate golf for the rest of his career. Then along came Nicklaus. Nicklaus was a shambling, middle-class fat kid who dared to take on and beat Americas favourite star. And in the end Nicklaus would prove by far the more successful of the two. (On the course, that is.). Arnie was brilliant he won seven major titles but Jack was out of this world. His record of eighteen majors still stands.But this is a morality story too. Each man wanted what the other had what he himself could not have. Arnie was loved by everyone, and with the help of newly created sports marketing agency IMG he became immensely wealthy. For the best part of three decades, he was the highest-earning sportsman in the world. But he wanted Jacks titles. Jack may have had all the glory on the course, but for all that the sport never quite took him to its heart, and through a series of business disasters, he never accumulated anything like Arnies riches. In the end, neither could be satisfied.Ian OConnor brilliantly brings to life the story of two men, their rivalry and a whole sport, in a gripping, no-holds-barred account of one of sports most fascinating pairings.	2009-07-02	Yellow Jersey Press						SPO016000

9780224085335	Taking pictures	Anne Enright		The stories in Taking Pictures are snapshots of the body in trouble: in denial, in extremis, in love. Mapping the messy connections between people and their failures to connect the characters are captured in the grainy texture of real life: freshly palpable, sensuous and deeply flawed. From Dublin to Venice, from an American college dorm to a holiday caravan in France, these are stories about women stirred, bothered, or fascinated by men they cannot understand, or understand too well. Enright s women are haunted by children, and by the ghosts of the lives they might have led lit by new flames, old flames, and flames that are guttering out.A woman s one night stand is illuminated by dreams of a young boy on a cliff road, another s is thwarted by an swarm of somnolent bees. A pregnant woman is stuck in a slow lift with a tactile American stranger, a naked mother changes a nappy in a hotel bedroom, and waits for her husband to come back from the bar. These are sharp, vivid stories of loss and yearning, of surrender to responsibilities or to unexpected delight; all share the unsettling, dislocated reality, the subversive wit and awkward tenderness that have marked Anne Enright as one of our most thrillingly gifted writers.	2008	Jonathan Cape						ZZZ000000

A Douglas Sirk-inspired melodrama full of big gestures and muted psychic torment. A veritable Tourette's Syndrome of rat-tat-tat name-dropping, from the A-list to the Z-list.

9780224087353	The Country Formerly Known as Great Britain,Writings 1989-2009	Ian Jack		In this selection from over twenty years of journalism, Ian Jack takes us to a place of which there are now only memories and ruins: the Great Britain that gave us the Industrial Revolution, a nation that led the world in feats of engineering, a Britain of empire, a place of vital cities, each with their own unique identity, a country whose residual presence can still be found in the strangest corners of the world. These pieces set out to deal with contemporary Britain - national tragedies, by-elections, football matches, obesity, 'chavs' - but are drawn back in time, vexed by the question of what came before. In 'Women and Children First', watching Titanic leads to an investigation into the legend of Wallace Henry Hartley, the famous band leader of the doomed liner, and a journey into the Lancashire working towns of the early 20th century; 'The 12.10 to Leeds', a magnificent report on the Hatfield Rail Crash, takes us right back to the beginning of the Industrial Revolution in the search for those	2009-10-27	Jonathan Cape						ZZZ000000
9780224087407	Embroideries	Marjane Satrapi		Embroideries gathers together many of the women in Marjane Satrapi's life - her beloved grandmother, her mother, an eccentric aunt, their friends and neighbours - for an afternoon of tea-drinking and talking. And as is only to be expected when a group of women reunite around cups of tea, the subjects turn to love, sex and the vagaries of men - in this case, Iranian men. As the afternoon progresses, these colourful women share their secrets about, among other things: how to fake your virginity, how to escape the husband your family has chosen for you, how to enjoy the miracles of plastic surgery and how to take advantage of being someone's mistress. By turns revealing and hilarious, these are stories about the lengths to which some women will go to find a man, to keep a man, or just to keep up appearances. We also witness tearful confessions and heavy-hearted tales of regret and betrayal, of unhappy marriages and of young women forced or choosing to marry for all the wrong reasons. And though love is mostly to blame, there's no missing the message that much of their suffering is due to a culture that prizes men above women and makes a woman's worth dependent on her virginity. Full of surprises, this introduction to the private lives of some very interesting ordinary women also demonstrates brilliantly how much women the world over have in common.	2008-09-04	Random House						CGN000000

9780330355667	Strange places, questionable people	John Simpson		For over 30 years, John Simpson has travelled the world to report on the most significant events of our time. From being punched in the stomach by Harold Wilson on one of his first days as a reporter, to escaping summary execution in Beirut, flying into Teheran with the returning Ayatollah Khomeini, and narrowly avoiding entrapment by a beautiful Czech secret agent, Simpson has had an astonishingly eventful career. In 1989 he witnessed the Tiananmen Square massacre, the fall of the Berlin Wall, and the collapse of Communism throughout Eastern Europe and, only weeks later, in South Africa, the release of Nelson Mandela. With Simpson's uncanny knack of being in the right place at the right time, this autobiography is a ring-side seat at every major event in recent global history.	1999-11	Pan						ZZZ000000

9780330371629	An unexpected light,travels in Afghanistan	Jason Elliot		An Unexpected Light, Travels in Afghanistan was greeted on publication by universal critical acclaim and is now widely acknowledged as the most influential contemporary work of Afghanistan. Written on the eve of 9/11, at the height of Afghanistan's isolation from the world, Jason Elliot's uncannily prescient account of his winter journey through the country torn by civil war is as pertinent today as it was then. Winner of the Thomas Cook/ Daily Telegraph Travel Book Award in the UK and a New York Times Bestseller in the USA, it recounts the author's daring and passionate investigation into an extraordinary culture, first as a clandestine guest of the mujaheddin during the Soviet occupation, and ten years later during the Tlebn advance on the besieged capital, Kabul. This new edition of An Unexpected Light is illustrated with the author's photographs and celebrates a classic work of travel literature. 'Jason Elliot is that rare traveller who surrenders himself to people and places and this tale is a many-layered reconstruction of his experience . . . I am sure this book will soon be among the classics of travel' DORIS LESSING ' An Unexpected Light is often unexpectedly funny and constantly perceptive, but it is also profound' New York Times 'What raises the book to the level of a classic is its intensely personal meditation on the magic of unplanned adventure, of the pain and pleasure of pushing into the unknown. The whole book, like Elliot's travels themselves, operated on this heightened level' The Times	2000	Picador						ZZZ000000

The dead lie unburied, rubbish piles in the streets - and somewhere is West London a black woman dies in a rain-soaked gutter.  Her passing would have gone unmourned but for the young woman who finds her and who believes - apparently against reason - that Annie was murdered. But whatever the truth about Annie - whether she was as mad as her neighbours claimed, whether she lived in squalor as the police said - something passed between her and Mrs Ranelagh in the moment of death which binds this one woman to her cause for the next twenty years.  But why is Mrs Ranelagh so convinced it was murder when by her own account Annie died without speaking? And why would any woman spend twenty painstaking years uncovering the truth - unless her reasons are personal . . . ?	2001	Pan Books						ZZZ000000

Here his life is powerfully evoked in a novel that tells of a shy man, baffled by the conspiracies that rage around him and his ideas while he searches for the truth.

9780330391658	E=mc2,A Biography of the World's Most Famous Equation	David Bodanis		'By the end of the astonishing "E=mc2," a dedicated reader will have achieved, if only by osmosis, an understanding of Einstein's theory of relativity and feel quite at ease dining with Nobel Prize winners. It's a lucid, even thrilling study: the very best kind of science journalism. I didn't know I could know so much.' Fay Weldon, "Books of the Year, " "Washington Post"  In 1905, Albert Einstein produced five historic papers that shattered many cherished scientific beliefs. One of those papers introduced the theory of special relativity and his legendary equation, E=mc2. Generations have grown up knowing that equation changed the shape of our world, but without understanding what it really means and why it is so significant.  In this fascinating biography David Bodanis tells the story of one of the greatest scientific discoveries in history. He looks at the elements 'e', 'm' and 'c'; and honours the scientists whose landmark discoveries paved the way for Einstein. He plots the course of the equation through the twentieth century, showing how our lives have been revolutionized by its applications; and looks far ahead to the future.  But as with any biography, it is the human stories that really ignite the subject - stories of love, courage and tragedy, of near misses, disappointments and disasters that, brought together by Bodanis in this remarkable book, turn Einstein's seemingly impenetrable theory into a dramatic and accessible human achievement.  '"Both informative and highly readable...E=mc2 is a wonderful romp through Einstein's famous formula.. this is everything a popular science book should be' DAILY EXPRESS "  "'Bodanis himself seems like an intellectual thermonuclear explosion, a kind of Jonathan Miller on speed...This is an outstanding introduction to relativity by a gifted practitioner of popular science' INDEPENDENT "  '"With skill and plenty of colourful anecdotes Bodanis traces the intellectual ancestry of E=mc2...fast moving and entertaining' THE TIMES "  "'E=mc2 reveals, amongst other wonders, how many women physicists were involved in the story.

Nevertheless, only two years after breaking his back in a freefall parachuting accident, Bear Grylls overcame severe weather conditions, fatigue, dehydration and a last-minute illness to stand on top of the world's highest mountain. Facing Up is the story of his adventure, his courage and humour, his friendship and faith.  'No one could fail to be gripped by his heartfelt excitement and emotion over what was the adventure of a lifetime.' "Independent"  'Bear's tale is by turns hilarious and horrific.'

9780330411486	Red	Allan Sealy		Billed as an alphabet, and narrated by the nameless 'N', "Red" introduces us first to N's friend, Zach. In St Petersburg for a music festival, Zach encounters the red-headed Aline in the Matisse Room at the Hermitage and is immediately bewitched. The two fall in love as quickly as they fall into bed and it seems that nothing can keep them apart. But other characters also appear between the sheets: a gang of five black-shorted, grease-smeared, soot-smudged men, who take what they want, stealing money (and, on one occasion, a piece of art) from homes of the rich; a girl who tends pigs, and wants to keep what is hers; a workman whose wants are few, but with devastating consequences. Even aspects of N's own life are revealed: his awkward relationships with his teenage daughter and her American mother. As these stories overlap and entwine, "Red" is revealed as a vibrant, violent tale: a love story and a story about the love of art, about life imitating art, about the end of love -- and the end of life.  'A trio of colour-coded stories . . . "Red"'s architecture brings with it an associative, encyclopaedic logic, a familiar way of organizing information whereby these disparate stories, digressions and fragments of theory draw together to inform the narratives; its structure spreads out the histories and movements of its characters through the alphabet' "TLS"	2007-03-02	Picador						ZZZ000000

Whether describing dancing executioners, burial rites in Western Mexico, or the eponymous voyage by dhow, Lewis's writing brings the world, in all its complexity, vividly to life. His words combine the poetic with the more prosaic, blending first-hand experience with snatches of conversation, and enriching colourful description with historical information. Moreover, Lewis is never afraid to tackle the controversial issues other -- lesser -- writers might shy away from: politics, economics, the problems of tourism. In his hands (and words), the world is at once rendered small enough that we can gain insights into lives, people and places that we could previously only have imagined, and at the same time, made much, much larger.  Graham Greene thought him 'one of our best writers, not of any particular decade but of our century' -- VOYAGE BY DHOW proves Norman Lewis to be one of the best writers of this century -- and, indeed, this millennium -- too.

9780330412513	That eye, the sky	Tim Winton		A tale about a boy's vision of the world beyond, and the blurry distinctions between the natural and supernatural At twelve years old, Morton ' Ort for short ' is not quite a child, but not yet an adult; his isolated outback world is an intriguing combination of boyish innocence, adolescent confusion and burgeoning awareness. When his father is seriously injured in a car crash, however, that world is suddenly thrown into complete disarray and the whole family have to adjust. As Ort, his sister, mother and grandmother are struggling to come to terms with what has happened, a stranger appears in their midst. Preaching God's word, Henry Warburton's unexpected arrival seems eerily prescient, at a time when the family most need a helping hand, and Henry quickly makes himself indispensable. In fact, for Ort in particular, it is Henry's presence, perhaps more even than his father's accident, that brings the greatest change to his world.

In my dreams, it all happens as it happened, and I see it and be it again and again and the confusion never wears off.

It is an isolated place, with a swamp and an old white bridge and the forest encroaching from all sides. The solitude is tangible. But when a mysterious creature is suddenly on the loose, killing livestock and preying on everyone's deepest fears, four inhabitants find themselves unexpectedly in one another's company ' with chilling results.

Naipaul's classic account of his journeys through Iran, Pakistan, Malaysia and Indonesia; 'the believers' are the Muslims he met on those journeys, young men and women battling to regain the original purity of their faith in the hope of restoring order to a chaotic world. It is a uniquely valuable insight into modern Islam, and the comforting simplifications of religious fanaticism.

He loved and respected them, composed for them, performed with them. This unique biography looks at his interaction with each, starting with his family (his mother, Maria Anna and beloved and talented sister, Nannerl), and his marriage (which brought his other family, the Weber sisters). His relationships with his artists are examined, in particular those of his operas, through whose characters Mozart gave voice to the emotions of women who were, like his entire female acquaintance, restrained by the conventions and structures of eighteenth-century society. This is their storyas well as hisand shows once again that a great part of the composers genius was in his understanding and musical expression of human nature.

She has looked after Katherine since she was a baby, when her father was killed in a car crash and her mother vanished. Poll's ambition is for things to stay exactly the same for ever, and for Katherine never to leave their pit village of Bank Top.  Katherine has other ideas, and she can feel change is coming; the omens are all around her. In the meantime, she cleans up after Poll, revises for her exams, watches daytime television and surfs the net at the library trying to find out how to be bulimic.

This is Don DeLillo's second play, and it is funny, sharp, and deep-reaching. Its characters tend to have needs and desires shaped by the forces of broadcast technology. This is the way we talk to each other today. This is the way we tell each other things, in public, before listening millions, that we don't dare to say privately. Nothing is allowed to be unseen. Nothing remains unsaid. And everything melts repeatedly into something else, as if driven by the finger on the TV remote. This is also a play that makes obsessive poetry out of the language of routine airline announcements and the flow of endless information. "Valparaiso" has been performed by the American Repertory Theatre in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and by the Steppenwolf Theatre Company in Chicago.	2004	Picador						ZZZ000000

9780330427470	Dr Ragab's Universal Language	Twigger Robert		Charlatan. Guru. Master of disguise. Ahead of his time, wise beyond his years, a simple opportunist or the great pretender; however you choose to see him, one fact is certain: Dr Ragab is a mysterious man. Talked about by pretty much everyone in 1920s Cairo, only a few get the chance to make his acquaintance, and fewer still -- one person, in fact -- get to study his life lessons. Hertwig is that lucky soul. Or not so lucky, perhaps: not when he finds himself, at the very end of the second world war, imprisoned in a bunker by a gang of thugs. And yet... there is a possible way out. Not in the conventional sense, it's true, but when you're holed up several feet underground, unsure of how long your captors plan to keep you alive, convention isn't necessarily a good thing, as Dr Ragab would be the first to proclaim -- and it's his Universal Language that may just provide Hertwig with the escape route he needs. As unconventional as the eponymous Ragab, Robert Twigger's novel takes the reader on a surreal journey from Ealing to Egypt, via Germany. Clever, funny and thought-provoking, Dr Ragab's Universal Language is, in every sense, beyond belief: part tall tale and part self-help manual, it is, like Dr R himself, impossible to pin down -- or, indeed, to put down.

The book contains new and rare material including many unpublished conversations with Hendrix and major insights from more than fifty fresh sources who have previously kept their silence. Fellow rock stars and musicians, childhood neighbours, laywers and newspaper editors are among those who knew Jimi well and are now willing to speak about who he really was and what events marked his lightning-fast ride to the top, and the extraordinary highs and lows which ultimately led to his death.

9780330438896	T is for Trespass	Sue Grafton		In what may be her most unsettling novel to date, Sue Grafton's T is for Trespass is also her most direct confrontation with the forces of evil. Beginning slowly with the day-to-day life of a private eye, Grafton suddenly shifts from the voice of Kinsey Millhone to that of Solana Rojas, introducing readers to a chilling sociopath. Rojas is not her birth name. It is an identity she cunningly stole, an identity that gives her access to private caregiving jobs. The true horror of the novel builds with excruciating tension as the reader foresees the awfulness that lies ahead. The suspense lies in whether Millhone will realize what is happening in time to intervene. Though set in the late eighties, T is for Trespass could not be more topical: identity theft; elder abuse; betrayal of trust; the breakdown in the institutions charged with caring for the weak and the dependent. It reveals a terrifying but all-too-real rip in the social fabric. Once again, Grafton opens up new territory with startling results.	2008-10-30	Pan Macmillan						ZZZ000000

9780330439688	Comrades,Communism: A World History	Robert Service		Almost two decades have passed since the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe and the USSR. Robert Service, one of our finest historians of modern Russia, sets out to examine the history of communism throughout the world. His uncomfortable conclusion - and an important message for the twenty-first century - is that although communism in its original form is now dead or dying, the poverty and injustice that enabled its rise are still dangerously alive. Unsettling, compellingly written and brilliantly argued, this is a superb work of history and one that demands to be read.  'Bears all the hallmarks of a classic work of historical literature ... the true international legacy of communism [is] analysed to magisterial effect in this exhilarating work' Hwyel Williams "New Statesman"  'One of the best-ever studies of the subject ... a remarkable accomplishment"' Economist"  'An outstanding book, written with grace and style' "Daily Telegraph "  '[A] brilliantly distilled world history of communism ... Confronted by Service's amazing array of evidence to show that communism could only ever have flourished under conditions of extreme and all-pervasive oppression, only the determinedly softheaded would try to argue with him' Craig Brown, "Mail on Sunday"	2008-05-09	Pan Books						ZZZ000000

Robert Service draws on hitherto unexamined archives and on his profound understanding of Russian history to draw a portrait of the man and his legacy, revealing that though his followers have represented Trotsky as a pure revolutionary soul and a powerful intellect unjustly hounded into exile by Stalin and his henchmen. The reality is very different, as this masterful and compelling biography reveals.	2010	Pan Macmillan						ZZZ000000

9780330440783	Essays in love	Alain De Botton		Essays in Love will appeal to anyone who has ever been in a relationship or confused about love. The book charts the progress of a love affair from the first kiss to argument and reconciliation, from intimacy and tenderness to the onset of anxiety and heartbreak. The work's genius lies in the way it minutely analyses emotions we've all felt before but have perhaps never understood so well: it includes a chapter on the anxieties of when and how to say 'I love you' and another on the challenges of disagreeing with someone else's taste in shoes. While gripping the reader with the talent of a great novelist, de Botton brings a philosopher's sensibility to his analyses of the emotions of love, resulting in a genre-breaking book that is at once touching and thought-provoking. 'The book's success has much to do with its beautifully modelled sentences, its wry humour and its unwavering deadpan respect for its reader's intelligence . . . full of keen observation and flashes of genuine lyricism, acuity and depth.' Francine Prose, New Republic 'Witty, funny, sophisticated, neatly tied up, and full of wise and illuminating insights.' P. J. Kavanagh, Spectator 'De Botton is a national treasure.' Susan Hill 'I doubt if de Botton has written a dull sentence in his life.' Jan Morris, New Statesman 'Single-handedly, de Botton has taken philosophy back to its simplest and most important purpose: helping us to live our lives.'

Her previous novel, Raven Black, was a deserved winner of the prestigious Duncan Lawrie Dagger for best crime novel of 2006...

9780330444361	Musicophilia,Tales of Music and the Brain	Oliver W. Sacks		An illuminating book about the power of music, from the bestselling author of THE MAN WHO MISTOOK HIS WIFE FOR A HAT. Oliver Sacks has been hailed by the New York Times as "one of the great clinical writers of the 20th century". In this eagerly-awaited new book, the subject of his uniquely literate scrutiny is music: our relationship with it, our facility for it, and what this most universal of passions says about us. In chapters examining savants and synesthetics, depressives and musical dreamers, Sacks succeeds not only in articulating the musical experience but in locating it in the human brain. He shows that music is not simply about sound, but also movement, visualisation, and silence. He follows the experiences of patients suddenly drawn to or suddenly divorced from music. And in so doing he shows, as only he can, both the extraordinary spectrum of human expression and the capacity of music to heal. Wise, compassionate and compellingly readable, MUSICOPHILIA promises, like all the best writing, to alter our conception of who we are and how we function, to lend a fascinating insight into the mysteries of the mind, and to show us what it is to be human.	2007-10-05	Picador						ZZZ000000

These people are the driving forces behind China's economic boom: they work very hard and for little money to make the trainers, ornaments, designer handbags and toys which we buy.  Through the lives of two young women, Chang vividly portrays a world where you can lose your boyfriend and your friends with the loss of a cell phone; where lying about your age, your education, and your work experience is often a requisite for getting ahead; where a few computer or English lessons can catapult you into a completely different social class.

9780330493260	If You Are Afraid of Heights	Raj Kamal Jha		Written in Jha's exquisitely crafted and beautiful, precise prose, "If You Are Afraid of Heights" offers the reader a glimpse into a looking-glass world where nothing is quite what it seems and yet everything is strangely familiar. A man and a woman meet in a midnight road accident and fall in love. A reporter arrives in a small town to uncover the story of a child's rape and murder. A young girl, shaken by a series of suicides in her neighbourhood, worries for her parents' safety. Three seemingly separate stories, and yet interwoven themes and recurring motifs suggest a connection between the strands: a crow flying overhead, a sky-scraper larger than any built before, a dog missing part of its tail, a news report . . .  In a novel that defies categorisation, Jha tackles issues of abuse, neglect, and the power of hope: "If You Are Afraid of Heights" is about the private journeys that people take in their minds; about imaginations fuelled by the images and narratives of a city. The result is a breathtaking odyssey that draws you deep into the uncharted zone between fantasy and reality, deep into the longings and secrets of human lives.	2004-07-01	Picador						ZZZ000000

9780434016242	Microcosm,E-coli and the New Science of Life	Carl Zimmer		In 1946, a 20 year old medical school student called Joshua Lederberg decided to find out whether microbes make love. Lederbeter was motivated not by a displaced libido, but by scientific ambition. At the age of seven, he had declared that he hoped to become 'like Einstein' and to 'discover a few things in science.' The 'few things' Lederberg discovered would revolutionise modern science and earn him a Nobel Prize. He chose to observe the breeding habits of a certain bacterium called IEscherichia coli/I, better known as IE coli./I His experiments used defective IE coli/I strains lacking the essential molecules to reproduce by cloning which should, by rights, perish in the petri dish. But slowly, a few colonies of survivors began to spread accross the dishes. The only possible explanation for their survival was that they were a product of sex. Not only had Lederberg proved that bacteria have sex, he had also proved they have genes. Since then, what was once nothing more than a humble resident of the human gut has become our best guide to what it means to be alive. Most of us might only know IE coli/I for its lethal strain that causes food poisoning. Zimmer uses IE coli/I as a prism to understand what life is, what it was, and what it will become. Among other things, Zimmer tells us how IE coli/I microbes talk to each other, how studies of their evolution represent the most powerful evidence in support of natural selection, and how they might just explain life on other planets...	2008	William Heinemann						ZZZ000000

New York, 1929, a city of speakeasies, swells and hoodlums at the fag end of the roaring twenties. It's a hell of a time and place for a young cop to be trying to make his way in the world. Joe Quinn has been given a shot at the NYPD's main headquarters squad and his first case is one that could put his name up in lights; a banker flops onto Wall Street and all the signs point to murder. Pretty soon, the dead man is not alone; a group of old buddies is being eliminated, in a particularly gruesome manner. The men have connections to Lucky Luciano and other denizens of the organized crime world.

The days of such naked corruption are supposed to be over, but nothing in prohibition era Manhattan is that simple. For Joe Quinn, a case that starts as an opportunity swiftly becomes a nightmare from which there is no escape. The path seems to lead inexorably towards his own father, once New York's foremost celebrity cop.

9780552153690	Ark Royal,Sailing Into Glory	Mike Rossiter		The Life, Death and Rediscovery of the Legendary Second World War Aircraft Carrier. The fascinating story of the life, legend and rediscovery of a British naval icon. In June 1941 HMS Ark Royal sailed through a ferocious storm intent on tracking the Bismarck. A dozen swordfish bombers took off from her deck and pounded shell after shell into the German battleship, sending her to the ocean floor. It was a signal victory that resonated around the world. Hitler, furious at the loss of the German fleet's flagship, demanded the destruction of the Ark Royal. HMS Ark Royal, launched in 1938, was one of the most sophisticated weapons in the British military arsenal. In her first two years of operation the Ark Royal survived countless attacks, and was considered one of the luckiest ships in the navy. But her luck was not to last, and within one month of sinking the Bismarck, HMS Ark Royal was destroyed while sailing off the coast of Gibraltar. There she rested, one kilometre beneath the sea, until her wreck was discovered by Mike Rossiter in 2004. In gripping detail, and using the testimony of survivors and the men who lived, flew and fought on the Ark Royal, Mike Rossiter tells her remarkable story, and of the quest to discover this naval legend.

9780552154154	Teardrop on the Cheek of Time,The Story of the Taj Mahal	Diana Preston&Michael Preston		In 1631, the heartbroken Moghul Emperor, Shah Jahan, ordered the construction of a monument of unsurpassed splendour and majesty in memory of his beloved wife. Theirs was an extraordinary story of passionate love: although almost constantly pregnant she bore him fourteen children Mumtaz Mahal followed her husband on every military campaign, in order that they might never be apart. But then Mumtaz died in childbirth. Blinded by grief, Shah Jahan created an exquisite and extravagant memorial for her on the banks of the river Jumna. A gleaming mausoleum of flawless symmetry, the Taj Mahal was built from milk-white marble and rose sandstone, and studded with a fortune in precious jewels. It took twenty years to complete and involved over 20,000 labourers, depleting the Moghul treasuries. But Shah Jahan was to pay a greater price for his obsession. He ended his days imprisoned by his own son in Agra Fort, gazing across the river at the monument to his love. The building of the Taj Mahal had set brother against brother and son against father in a savage conflict that pushed the seventeenth century's most powerful empire into irreversible decline. The story behind the Taj Mahal has the cadences of Greek tragedy, the carnage of a Jacobean revenge play and the ripe emotion of grand opera. With the storytelling skills that characterize their previous books, in this compelling narrative history Diana and Michael Preston succeed in putting a revealing human face on the famous marble masterpiece.	2008-04-07	Corgi						ZZZ000000

9780552155090	Unseen	Mari Jungstedt		The first body they found was the dog. The poor creatures throat has been cut, and one paw severed completely. Then they found the body of the woman. She had been stabbed, again and again; she was naked, a piece of cloth had been stuffed into her mouth. The picturesque holiday island of Gotland is in the middle of a busy tourist season when the young woman is discovered murdered. Suspicion falls on her husband the couple had been seen fighting the evening before. Inspector Anders Knutas is hoping it will be a straight-forward case; the local authorities are hoping so too, but more out of an interest in protecting the tourist trade than any desire to see justice served. Then another victim is discovered, again she is a young woman and she has been murdered in the same chilling manner. Inspector Knutas must face up to the horrifying prospect that there is a serial killer loose on the island. Knutas, aided by investigative journalist Johan Berg, begins to piece together the tragic history that unites the two victims, and alarmingly points to more murders to come. The killer remains unknown, moving freely, unseen, on the island.

Against the odds, Lewis survived this trek, made it across the border into Oman, and eventually sought asylum the UK, where he had spent his childhood. Now he had to work out how to rescue his mother and sister, who had been thrown into Abu Ghraib once Lewis's escape became known. The only thing which could help was money and lots of it, so Lewis fraudulently transferred pound;37,500 from the accounts of William Hill (where he had a temporary job) into his own bank, and wired it to Baghdad in order to pay the necessary bribes.

These were the everyday concerns of thirteen-year-old Moscow schoolgirl Nina Lugovskaya, who began to write a diary in 1932. Her indignant outbursts against the brutal raids and purges of Stalins terror appear alongside the more typical adolescent worries about girlfriends, boys, parties and homework. For five years Nina scribbled down her most intimate thoughts and dreams, including her ambition one day to become a writer. Then in 1937 the NKVD, Stalins secret police, ransacked Ninas home and discovered her diary. Ninas criticism of the regime provided sufficient evidence for the charge of treason, and she, her mother and two sisters were sentenced to five years hard labour in the Gulag, followed by seven years exile in Siberia. Recently Ninas diary was discovered in the KGB archives, complete with the original passages underlined by the secret police. Like Anne Franks diary, this journal poignantly reveals life at a time of political upheaval, betrayal and repression through the eyes of an innocent.	2008-03-10	Black Swan						ZZZ000000

9780552775243	The Greatest Show on Earth: The Evidence for Evolution	Richard Dawkins		Charles Darwin's masterpiece, On the Origin of Species , shook society to its core on publication in 1859. Darwin was only too aware of the storm his theory of evolution would provoke but he would surely have raised an incredulous eyebrow at the controversy still raging a century and a half later. Evolution is accepted as scientific fact by all reputable scientists and indeed theologians, yet millions of people continue to question its veracity. In The Greatest Show on Earth Richard Dawkins takes on creationists, including followers of 'Intelligent Design' and all those who question the fact of evolution through natural selection. Like a detective arriving on the scene of a crime, he sifts through fascinating layers of scientific facts and disciplines to build a cast-iron case: from the living examples of natural selection in birds and insects; the 'time clocks' of trees and radioactive dating that calibrate a timescale for evolution; the fossil record and the traces of our earliest ancestors; to confirmation from molecular biology and genetics. All of this, and much more, bears witness to the truth of evolution. The Greatest Show on Earth comes at a critical time: systematic opposition to the fact of evolution is now flourishing as never before, especially in America. In Britain and elsewhere in the world, teachers witness insidious attempts to undermine the status of science in their classrooms. Richard Dawkins provides unequivocal evidence that boldly and comprehensively rebuts such nonsense. At the same time he shares with us his palpable love of the natural world and the essential role that science plays in its interpretation. Written with elegance, wit and passion, it is hard-hitting, absorbing and totally convincing.	2010	Transworld Publ. Ltd UK						ZZZ000000

9780552994927	The men and the girls	Joanna Trollope		Julia Hunter and Kate Bain have, it seems, each found true happiness with men old enough to be their fathers. The immaculate Julia organises her husband Hugh, a television personality, with the same efficiency with which she runs their lovely home and cherubic twins. Kate has lived with James Mallow, a retired teacher, for eight years, and although she refuses to marry him she is apparently devoted to him. Hugh and James, lifelong friends and now in their sixties, feel blessed indeed. But the age difference cannot be ignored forever, and when the eccentric and fiercely independent elderly spinster Miss Beatrice Bachelor enters their lives--after James, absent-mindedly driving without his spectacles through the dark and rainy Oxford streets, knocks her off her bicycle--a chain of events is set off in which many suppressed discontents and frustrations emerge. Kate begins to seek out friends of her own age, while Julia finds her own career blossoming just as her husband's is beginning its natural decline. The tranquil lives of the men and the girls seem shattered as new relationships develop and old anxieties surface, and nothing will ever be quite the same again.	1993	Black Swan						ZZZ000000

As a teenager he was an outcast fleeing enemies on a mountain in northern Mongolia, an exile, a nobody. Yet it took only twenty years for Genghis to build the largest land empire in history u four times the size of Alexander's, twice the size of Rome's. How did he do it? What lessons does his life reveal about the nature of leadership? What is 'greatness' in leadership? What traits did Genghis possess exactly? Were they unique, or might some apply in other times and other places u even here and today?

Despite extensive news coverage and dogged investigation, the police inquiry has so far uncovered nothing. The case is rife with oddities: Amanda's strangely indifferent mother and her dangerous, drug-addled friends; her loving aunt and uncle; and two cops who have found so many abused or dead children they may already be over the edge. As the Indian summer fades, Amanda McCready stays gone banished so completely that she seems never to have existed.

Caught in a deadly tangle of lies and betrayal, they must confront the horror of what the world can inflict on its children in order to unravel a riddle that's anything but child's play.	2007-10-22	Bantam Paperbacks						ZZZ000000

What they find during the US-led attack on the 'most dangerous city on Earth', however, is not an insurgent bent on revenge, but a tiny puppy left behind when most of the city's population fled before the bombing.

9780553819397	Hunting Evil	Guy Walters		At the end of the Second World War some of the highest ranking members of the Nazi party escaped from justice. Some of them are names that have resonated deeply in twentieth-century history - Eichmann, Mengele, Martin Bormann and Klaus Barbie - not just for the monstrosity of their crimes, but because of the shadowy nature of their post-war existence, holed up in the depths of Latin America, always one step ahead of their pursuers. The nature of their escape was as gripping as any good thriller. Aided and abetted by corrupt Catholic priests in the Vatican, they travelled down secret 'rat lines', hid in foreboding castles high in the Austrian alps, and were taken in by shady Argentine secret agents. The attempts to bring them to justice are no less dramatic, with vengeful Holocaust survivors, inept politicians, and daring plots to kidnap or assassinate the fugitives.

9780553819618	Ring of Fire	Rick Broadbent		MotoGP is enjoying a period of unprecedented popularity and Ring of Fire details the acclaim, the heroism and the pressures of riding motorbikes at speeds of more than 200mph. This is a world where manufacturers invest millions and the world champion celebrates by staging mock jail breaks and giving pillion rides to a blow-up doll. One rider warms up for major races by singing Hank Marvin songs on his karaoke machine and a rising Italian star sees the world in terms of black and white energy tubes. Another sees nothing strange in racing with two broken ankles. Ring of Fire covers the recent history of MotoGP, from American Nicky Hayden spectacularly overturning established champion Valentino Rossi in 2006, through the emergence of wild young Australian Casey Stoner as the new champion in 2007, to the fierce rivalry between them and Spaniards Dani Pedrosa and Jorge Lorenzo in what would prove to be one of the most closely-contested years of racing in 2008. It gives a behind the scenes look at World Superbike Champion James Toseland's attempts to break into this elite, and looks back at the tradition of reprobates, romance and debauchery in the paddock dating back to the 60s and stars like Mike Hailwood and Giacomo Agostino. Rick Broadbent introduces us not just to the stars and the multi-million pound contracts, but also to the officals, mechanics, doctors, team owners and fans who make up this white-knuckle ride of a sport. By turns funny, sad, shocking and uplifting, Ring of Fire brings us face to face with those who battle to emerge unscathed, or who just ignore the pain and ride to win against all odds.	2010-08-02	Bantam Paperbacks						SPO028000

It showed the emotional reunion of two young men and their pet lion, Christian, after they had left him in Africa to be introduced into his rightful home in the wild. Anthony 'Ace' Bourke and John Rendall visited London from Australia in 1969 and bought a boisterous lion cub in Harrods. But Christian soon grew from cuddly cub to King of the Kings Road in London, and the only way to avoid him being incarcerated in a zoo was to place him under the expert care of George Adamson in Kenya. Ace and John did not return to see their lion for a year. A Lion Called Christian tells their touching story, accompanied by stunning photographs. It's a unique and extraordinary tale of its time that resonates again today with a worldwide audience, thanks to the internet age, and is destined to become one of the great classics of animal literature.	2010	Transworld Publishers Limited						ZZZ000000

9780593056424	Ritual	Mo Hayder		Just after lunch on a Tuesday in April, nine feet under water, police diver Flea Marley closes her gloved fingers around a human hand. The fact that there's no body attached is disturbing enough. Yet more disturbing is the discovery, a day later, of the matching hand.

9780593056813	Southern Lights	Danielle Steel		Assistant D.A. and single mom Alexa Hamilton has just been handed the kind of case that makes careers: the trial of accused serial killer Luke Quentin. Sifting through mountains of forensic evidence, enduring Quentin's cold, suggestive stares in the courthouse, Alexa relentlessly builds her case and prepares for a high-stakes trial... until threatening letters throw her private life into turmoil. The letters are addressed to Alexa's beautiful 17-year-old daughter, Savannah, who Alexa has raised alone since her painful divorce years before. Alexa is certain that Quentin is behind the letters - and that they are too dangerous to ignore. Suddenly Alexa must make the toughest choice of all - and send her daughter back to the very place that Alexa swore she would never return: to her ex-husband's world of southern tradition, long memories, and the antebellum charm of Charleston. Eleven years had passed since Alexa left the South behind, fleeing the pain of her ex-husband's betrayal and the cold cruelty of his prominent Charleston family. Alexa's wounds are still fresh - but she knows she must put her own pain aside for Savannah's safety. Now, while Alexa's trial builds to a climax in New York, her daughter is settling into southern life, discovering a part of her family history she's never known - from the ice-cold beauty who stole her father away to a domineering matriarch and several half-brothers and sisters. As a family's wounds are exposed and the healing begins, Alexa and Savannah, after a season in different worlds, will come together again - strengthened by the trials they have faced, changed by the mysteries they have unraveled, armed with miracles that are uniquely their own. In this masterfully told tale, Danielle Steel creates a stunning array of contrasts - from the gritty chaos of Manhattan's criminal court system to the cool gentility of an old Southern family, from the rage of a hardened criminal to the tender bond between a mother and daughter. A novel that will catch you off guard at every turn, Southern Lights is Danielle Steel at her electrifying best.	2009-10-22	BANTAM UK						ZZZ000000

9780593061749	The Greatest Show on Earth,The Evidence for Evolution	Richard Dawkins		'It is no accident that we see green almost wherever we look. It is no accident that we find ourselves perched on one tiny twig in the midst of a blossoming and flourishing tree of life; no accident that we are surrounded by millions of other species, eating, growing, rotting, swimming, walking, flying, burrowing, stalking, chasing, fleeing, outpacing, outwitting . We are surrounded by endless forms, most beautiful and most wonderful, and it is no accident, but the direct consequence of evolution by non-random natural selection - the only game in town, the greatest show on Earth.' Charles Darwin's masterpiece On the Origin of Species shook society to its core on publication in 1859. Darwin was only too aware of the storm his theory of evolution would provoke. But he would surely have raised an incredulous eyebrow at the controversy still raging a century and a half later. Evolution is accepted as scientific fact by all reputable scientists and indeed theologians, yet millions of people continue to question its veracity. In The Greatest Show on Earth Richard Dawkins takes on creationists, including followers of 'Intelligent Design' and all those who question the fact of evolution through natural selection. In this brilliant tour de force he pulls together the incontrovertible evidence that underpins it. Like a detective arriving on the scene of a crime, he sifts through fascinating layers of scientific facts and disciplines to build a cast-iron case: from the living examples of natural selection around us in birds and insects; the 'time clocks' of trees and radioactive dating that calibrate a timescale for evolution; the fossil record and the traces of our earliest ancestors; to confirmation from molecular biology and genetics. All of this, and much more, bears witness to the truth of evolution. The Greatest Show on Earth comes at a critical time: systematic opposition to the truth of evolution is now flourishing as never before, especially in America. In Britain and elsewhere in the world teachers witness insidious attempts to undermine the status of science in their classrooms. Richard Dawkins provides unequivocal evidence that boldly and comprehensively rebuts such nonsense. At the same time he shares with us his palpable love of the natural world and the essential role that science plays in its interpretation. Written with elegance, wit and passion, it is hard-hitting, absorbing and totally convincing.	2009-09	Bantam Press						ZZZ000000

9780701178178	New Novel 2 (Tpb)	Anne Rice		At the centre: Toby O'Dare - Lucky the Fox - a contract killer of underground fame. A soulless soul, a dead man walking...He's fallen far from grace, and lives under a series of aliases. Lucky takes his orders from someone he calls 'The Right Man', someone whose name and allegiances he doesn't know. When the novel opens, the time is the present. The place is Riverside, California, the Mission Inn. For O'Dare, it is his place of solace; he can be there without disguise. This time, he's been sent on an assignment to kill. Into his nightmarish world of lone and lethal missions, comes a mysterious stranger, a seraph, who offers him a chance to save lives, rather than destroy them. Lucky, who grew up in a New Orleans, son of an alcoholic mother and a murdered father, long ago dreamt of being a priest, craving rituals, taking refuge in history, books and lute music - but instead came to embody danger and violence - now seizes his chance. He is lifted in (angel) time and carried back through the ages to thirteenth-century England, to a dangerous world, where Jews live an uneasy existence, their money coveted and protected by the crown for their function as money-lenders, unjustly despised by the rest. Into this primitive, treacherous setting, where accusations of ritual murder have been made against innocent Jews, and children have been found dead or missing, O'Dare begins a journey of salvation that leads him from the medieval villages of England to the cities of London and Paris as his quest becomes a story of danger and flight, loyalty and betrayal, selflessness and love.	2009-11-02	Random House						ZZZ000000
9780701179984	The Shadows in the Street	Susan Hill		Simon Serrailler is back in the fifth installment of this extremely popular series. Simon Serrailler has just wrapped up a particularly exhausting and difficult case for SIFT - Special Incident Flying Task force and is on a sabbatical couple of months on a far-flung Scottish island, Tallansay, walking, drawing, relaxing, and having a pleasant no-ties fling with the hotel barmaid, Kirsty. He is called back just before his leave is due to end by Paula Devenish the Chief Constable, when two local prostitutes go missing and are subsequently found strangled. By the time he gets back, another girl has disappeared. So, a vendetta against prostitutes by someone with a warped mind? A series of killings by an angry punter? But then the wife of the new Dean of St Michael's Cathedral goes missing, followed by another respectable young married woman, on her way to the early shift at the print works. Is this all the work of one serial killer? The murders all take place in and around the canal area, near the footbridge.	2010	Random House						FIC000000
9780701182106	The Lost Dog	Michelle De Kretser		Tom Loxley is holed up in a remote cottage in the bush, trying to finish a book on Henry James and the Uncanny when his dog goes missing, trailing a length of orange twine, tied with firm knots. Tom's lonely childhood in India taught him to tie knots but not to hold on... The house belongs to Nelly Zhang, a seductive, mysterious artist with whom Tom has become enthralled. The narrative spans ten days while Tom searches for his dog... and loops back in time to take the reader on a breathtaking journey into glittering worlds far beyond the present tragedy, from an Anglo-Indian childhood to the brittle contemporary Melbourne art scene, from Tom's scratchy, unbearably poignant relationship with his ailing mother to the unanswered puzzles in Nelly's past - her husband also disappeared in the bush. And the reader fears for Tom as well as for the dog. This is an impressive, haunting, beautifully written work by a remarkable writer, brilliantly counterpointing new city scapes and their inhabitants with the ancient continent beyond. With its atmosphere of menace and an acute sense of the persistence of the past, The Lost Dog is a gripping contemporary novel which explores the weight of history as well as different ways of seeing and trying to grasp the world.	2008	Chatto & Windus						ZZZ000000
9780701182427	The consequences of love	Sulaiman S. M. Y. Addonia		Under the hot sun, the Jeddah streets make a scene from an old black-and-white movie: the women dressed like long, dark shadows and the men in their light cotton tunics. Naser's friends have all left town for cooler climes but he can't get away: he's an outsider in Saudi and he needs to hold down his job at the local carwash. During his time off, he sits beneath his favourite palm tree, writing to the mother he has left behind in Africa and yearning for the glamorous Egyptian actress he hopes to meet one day. It's hard to adjust to a world that puts up so many barriers between men and women: walls in the mosque, divider panels in the buses and veils on the street. Naser feels increasingly trapped, not least by the religious police who keep watch through the shaded windows of their government jeeps. A splash of colour arrives in Naser's world when, unexpectedly, a small piece of paper is dropped at his feet. It is a love note, from a woman whose face he has never seen and whose voice he has never heard. She tells him that she will wear a pair of pink shoes the next time she passes so that he can pick her out from the other women in their identical black abayas. Erotic tension runs high; Naser and his 'habibati' begin to exchange letters. But in moments of doubt the pink shoes seem to lead him into a cul-de-sac of thwarted desire, fraught with danger. Relationships between unmarried men and women are illegal under the strict Wahhibism of Saudi state rule - and it's not long before their real, but illicit, love must face the hardest test of all.	2008-07-03	Chatto & Windus						ZZZ000000

9780712640176	The Lady in the Tower,The Fall of Anne Boleyn	Alison Weir		The imprisonment and execution of Queen Anne Boleyn, Henry VIII's second wife, in May 1536 was unprecedented in English history. It was sensational in its day, and has exerted endless fascination over the minds of historians, novelists, dramatists, poets, artists and film-makers ever since. Anne was imprisoned in the Tower of London on 2 May 1536, and tried and found guilty of high treason on 15 May. Her supposed crimes included adultery with five men, one her own brother, and plotting the King's death. She was executed on 19 May 1536. Mystery surrounds the circumstances leading up to her arrest. Was it Henry VIII who, estranged from Anne, instructed Master Secretary Thomas Cromwell to fabricate evidence to get rid of her so that he could marry Jane Seymour? Or did Cromwell, for reasons of his own, construct a case against Anne and her faction, and then present compelling evidence before the King? Following the coronation of her daughter Elizabeth I in 1558, Anne was venerated as a heroine of the English Reformation. Over the centuries, her dramatic story has inspired many artistic and cultural works and has remained ever-vivid in England's popular memory. Never before has there been a book devoted entirely to Anne Boleyn's fall. Alison Weir has reassessed the evidence and created a richly researched and detailed portrait of the last days of one of the most influential and important figures in English history.	2010	Random House						ZZZ000000

Needs can be met, and success achieved, not merely for oneself but for others (and the world) through dedication to the Lotus Sutra, a central teaching of Buddhism.

9780753519639	WHY YOUR WORLD IS ABOUT TO GET A WHOLE LOT SMALLER	Jeff Rubin		Soaring oil prices caused four out of the last five recessions. They caused the current recession. And they will cause the next one. Expensive oil costs us more than just money. It costs jobs, homes and in the long run it is going to radically alter the way we live. For if cheap oil is the fuel that keeps the machinery of globalisation in motion, then expensive oil has the same effect as pouring diesel into an unleaded tank. Everything stalls; the engine fails. Oil prices will rise again in the coming years, as this utterly convincing insight into our collective future argues. And as oil prices fluctuate wildly, our society will change dramatically, and for good. From the homes we live in and the cars we drive to the food we eat and the places we work, our daily lives and global economy are going to be transformed. But while this new, smaller world will take some getting used to, it will also open our eyes to a more localised and ultimately more liveable way of life.	2010	Virgin Books Limited						ZZZ000000

9780753522264	Winner-Take-All Society	Robert H. Frank&Philip J. Cook		Why does the top one per cent of the population capture such a disproportionate amount of the wealth? Why do top athletes win dozens of sponsorship deals, yet competitors who finish just moments behind struggle to attract a single deal? Why does one product become a runaway success, while others flounder and fail? The answer is the rise of ?winner-take-all? markets, in which small differences in performance lead to huge differences in reward. More relevant today than ever before, this fascinating book shows how in business, as in sport, thousands are competing for only a handful of top prizes. As Robert Frank and Philip J Cook reveal, this relentless emphasis on coming out on top has shaped our society and how we define success in troubling ways, creating growing income inequality and an enormous misallocation of talent, as more and more gifted people seek the big bucks and limelight of lucrative yet non-essential careers while vital professions scramble to attract staff. But there are measures we can take to create a more equitable and more prosperous future, and The Winner-Take-All Society shows the way.	2010-09-01	Virgin Books Limited						BUS069000
9780753522424	Googled,The End of the World as We Know It	Ken Auletta		There are companies that create waves and those that ride or are drowned by them. This is a ride on the Google wave, and the fullest account of how it formed and crashed into traditional media businesses. With unprecedented access to Googles founders and executives, as well as to those in media who are struggling to keep their heads above water, Ken Auletta reveals how the industry is being disrupted and redefined. Auletta goes inside Googles closed-door meetings, introducing Googles notoriously private founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, as well as those who work with and against them. In Googled, the reader discovers the secret sauce of the company's success and why the worlds of new and old media often communicate as if residents of different planets. It may send chills down traditionalists spines, but its a crucial roadmap to the future of media business: the Google story may well be the canary in the coal mine.Googled is candid, objective and authoritative. Crucially, its not just a history or reportage: its ahead of the curve and unlike any other Google books, which tend to have been near-histories, somewhat starstruck, now out of date or which fail to look at the full synthesis of business and technology.	2009	Virgin Books						ZZZ000000

9781843430483	The Eye of the Leopard	Henning Mankell		Hans Olofson is the son of a Swedish lumberjack. His childhood was unsettled; an alcoholic father, and a mother disappeared, only alive in old photographs. His adolescence was no easier as he lost both his best friend and his lover tragically. Alone and adrift, as a young man his only desire is to fulfil his lover s dream and visit the grave of a legendary missionary who survived alone in the remote hills of Northern Zambia. On reaching Africa, Olofson is struck by its beauty and mystery. After fulfilling his initial quest, an opportunity of employment in the region tempts him to stay. Time passes quickly. Though dismayed by the attitude of the white population to their adopted country, which is compounded by their vulnerability to alcohol and malaria, he is interested enough to take up sole responsibility for the farm he manages. For almost two decades Hans Olofson battles with a hostile environment and a placid, but resistant workforce. Set in the 1970s and 1980s, The Eye of the Leopard explores the relationship between the white farmers and their native workers. Through Olofson s descent into near mental collapse it becomes clear that many years spent in a foreign land do not necessarily breed an understanding of its people: a handful of generations of white settlers cannot change a continent underpinned by myth and superstition. The Eye of the Leopard is a first-rate and original psychological thriller delving deep into the mind of a man lost in an unknown world.	2008	Harvill						FIC022000

9781845950033	The Empire Stops Here,A Journey Along the Frontiers of the Roman World	Philip Parker		The Roman Empire was the largest and most enduring of the ancient world. From its zenith under Augustus and Trajan in the first century AD to its decline and fall amidst the barbarian invasions of the fifth century, the Empire guarded and maintained a frontier that stretched for 5,000 kilometres, from Carlisle to Cologne, from Augsburg to Antioch, and from Aswan to the Atlantic. Far from being at the periphery of the Roman world, the frontier played a crucial role in making and breaking emperors, creating vibrant and astonishingly diverse societies along its course which pulsed with energy while the centre became enfeebled and sluggish. This remarkable new book traces the course of those frontiers, visiting all its astonishing sites, from Hadrian s Wall in the north of Britain to the desert cities of Palmyra and Leptis Magna. It tells the fascinating stories of the men and women who lived and fought along it, from Alaric the Goth, who descended from the Danube to sack Rome in 410, to Zenobia the desert queen, who almost snatched the entire eastern provinces from Rome in the third century. It is at their edges, in time and geographical extent, that societies reveal their true nature, constantly seeking to recreate and renew themselves. In this examination of the places that the mighty Roman Empire stopped expanding, Philip Parker reveals how and why the Empire endured for so long, as well as describing the rich and complex architectural and cultural legacy which it has bequeathed to us.	2010-07-27	Random House						HIS000000

And Leonardo da Vinci was a visionary master and the most talented military engineer in Italy. What led him to work for the monstrous Borgia? And what attracted him to the cunning Machiavelli? In his extraordinary new book acclaimed historian Paul Strathern ingeniously focuses on this improbable collusion of three iconic figures of the Italian Renaissance to unite three mighty strands of the period - war, politics and art.

But, although there may only be a dozen or so participants, this isn't just any mountain bike race. This is the Tour Divide. Running from Banff in Canada to the Mexican border, the Tour Divide is, at more than 2,700 miles, the longest mountain bike race in the world. Not only is it 500 miles further than the Tour de France, its route along the continental divide goes through the heart of the Rocky Mountains and involves more than 200,000 feet of ascent - the equivalent of climbing Mount Everest seven times. Undaunted, Howard swaps the smooth tarmac roads of France for the mud, snow and ice of the Tour Divide. Instead of fending off attacks from Lance Armstrong, he has to deal with grizzly bears, mountain lions and moose, while millions of buzzing roadside fans are replaced by millions of buzzing mosquitoes. Two Wheels on my Wagon is the inspirational and often hilarious account of Howard's remarkable journey.	2010-04-15	Mainstream Publishing Company, Limited						ZZZ000000

Unable to find any hashish as a schoolboy in north London, he went to Morocco for supplies. Between school and university, he hitched around America in the mid-1960s, taking LSD with Timothy Leary. After teaming up with Howard Marks, they smuggled suitcases of hashish out of Afghanistan and Pakistan into Europe and VW campers filled with hashish from Lebanon into California. During the course of his extraordinary career, he witnessed revolution in Afghanistan, an unsuccessful coup in Greece, the preservation of the monarchy in Nepal and illicit arms deals with Saddam Hussein.

9781846040764	Last night I dreamed of peace	Dang Thuy Tram		LAST NIGHT I DREAMED OF PEACE is the moving diary kept by a 27-year-old Vietnamese doctor who was killed by the Americans during the Vietnam War, while trying to defend her patients. Not only is it an important slice of history, from the opposite side of DISPATCHES and APOCALYPSE NOW, but it shows the diarist - Dang Thuy Tram - as a vibrant human being, full of youthful idealism, a poetic longing for love, trying hard to be worthy of the Communist Party and doing her best to look after her patients under appalling conditions. She wrote straight from the heart and, because of this, her diary has been a huge bestseller in Vietnam - 350,000 copies sold in 2005 alone. Now Rider brings the first English translation, in book form, to the Commonwealth markets. But there is more: how the diary came to light is also an unusual story in its own right. Fred Whitehurst was a US intelligence officer on the scene just after Dang Thuy Tram was shot. He came across the diary and, instead of burning it there and then, took it home. His brother translated it and so began an odyssey that took 35 years, to find Thuy Tram's family in Vietnam, and return the small brown book to them. Remarkably, in 2005, Fred Whitehurst tracked down the young doctor's mother who graciously accepted it from this former GI who, as a result, was able to complete his own journey of reconciliation after years of bitterness as a Vietnam vet.	2009-01-01	Rider						ZZZ000000

This Himalayan valley of water, mist and mountains was once one of Indias greatest tourist draws. In 1989 it exploded into insurgency.

Through their eyes we see the rise of religious fundamentalism and intolerance, the ethnic cleansing of the Hindu population of the valley, and the recruitment of a generation to jihad. And, amid the fighting, families continue to try and educate their children, find work, and protect their physical and mental well-being, while attempting to build some kind of future beyond the annihilation of their old way of life.

9781846041594	Tales of Freedom	Ben Okri		As one of Britain's foremost poets, Ben Okri is rightly acclaimed for his use of language. And as a Booker Prize winning novelist, this skill was shown to particular effect in both Starbook (his most recent work) and in The Famished Road. In Tales of Freedom he brings both poetry and story together in a fascinating new form, using writing and image pared down to their essentials, where haiku and story meet. Thus we discover Pinprop, the slave to an old couple lost in a clearing, who holds the keys to the universe in his quirky hands. Then there is the beautifully dressed black Russian on the train, helping to film a new version of 'Eugene Onegin'. Later, in the chaos of the aftermath of war, orphaned children paint mysterious shapes of bulls, birds, hybrid creatures, and we wonder if grief has unhinged them into genius...And who is that woman, who hardly speaks, who presses a tiny flower into the palm of the young boy on the bus, and then leaves his life forever? Tales of Freedom offers a haunting necklace of images which flash and sparkle as the light shines on them. Quick and stimulating to read, but slowly burning in the memory, they offer a different, more transcendent way of looking at our extreme, gritty world - and show the wealth of freedom that's available beyond the confines of our usual perceptions.	2010-06-01	RIDER						FIC000000
9781846041723	Reinventing the Body, Resurrecting the Soul,How to Create a New Self	Deepak Chopra		This important new book picks up where Dr Deepak Chopra left off in his pioneering work Ageless Body, Timeless Mind. Having revealed the connection between our health and our thoughts, Dr Chopra shows us how to create a whole new self - the self we want to be - in this revolutionary sequel. Dr Chopra explains how the body is a reflection of the mind, 'a symbol in flesh and blood of everything you think and feel'. From early childhood each one of us has invented our bodies and our personalities through our beliefs, conditioning and responses to everyday stress. But we have mostly done this unconsciously, which is why we may now feel unfulfilled. Reinventing the Body, Resurrecting the Soul will help us to reconnect with our ideal sense of self, guiding us one step at a time through a remarkable process of renewal and discovery. Chopra invites us all to live from the soul, to satisfy our deepest desires in a life rich with joy and meaning. 'You are inventing your body in every moment of life,' he reasons. 'Why not take control and reinvent it from the highest level?'	2009	Rider						ZZZ000000

This hidden tradition places our soul at the centre of the universe and shows us how to recover a sense of meaning that so many of us have lost today.In this important book, Patrick Harpur explores the nature of our soul, as well as its destiny. He unpacks the myths that surround it and shows how it may actually be the very fabric of reality. And he explains that, not until we have a clear understanding of this invisible part of ourselves, can we discover the answers to many of our questions about existence and human nature. Ultimately, this knowledge could help us find our true place within the world in which we live.	2010-07-27	Ebury Publishing						REL051000
9781846042188	GLOBAL CITIZENS	Mark Gerzon		We are all aware of the number of global problems that need to be solved in order to save the future of the world: financial crises, the environment and terrorism, to name a few. But as the author of this stimulating and practical book makes clear, it is not enough for us to wait for governments and international companies to sort things out. We all have to realise our global common ground amidst differences everywhere in our lives, both at home and at work, locally and abroad. At the moment we are putting forward piecemeal solutions to global issues when we really need to start seeing ourselves as citizens of the world if we are to effect real change. The author, Mark Gerzon, is perfectly placed to explain this important new step which he believes we all need to take. He travels the globe lecturing, consulting and training, with clients ranging from Chinese and American politicians to leaders of the world's top think tanks, encouraging them to work together and to sharpen four key skills: witnessing, learning, connecting and partnering. Only when we have all truly become 'global citizens' does he believe we will become fully-fledged members of the human race, and start to solve the many crises facing our world.	2010	RIDER						POL016000
9781846042522	Made for Goodness	Desmond Tutu		As Archbishop of Cape Town at the height of the Apartheid regime in South Africa, Desmond Tutu saw many shocking and violent incidents. Later, as Chair of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, as well as a leading peace negotiator in many troubled parts of the world, he heard many appalling stories of mans inhumanity to man. Yet he still has a firm conviction that we are 'made by goodness for goodness'. Another way of putting this is: the essential truth about all of us is that we are made in the image and likeness of God. Tutu explains that, though we sometimes act out of depravity and despair, we do know in our heart of hearts that we are not as we were meant to be, and were created to be so much more. The truth of human goodness can get hidden under the fear that we cannot live up to its demands, or it can get buried under faults or failures, or it can just get forgotten. In this thoughtful and important book, the Archbishop (with his daughter, Mpho Tutu) shows how we can find our way back to goodness by changing our attitudes, by practising forgiveness, and by prayer. Then we will begin to see the goodness and beauty of others If our view changes, this in turn makes all the difference to the way we act. And how we act towards one another affects not only ourselves but everything in our world - for the better.	2010	RIDER						ZZZ000000

9781846553554	A Life in Letters	George Orwell		George Orwell was a tireless and lively correspondent. He communicated with family members, friends and newspapers, figures such as Henry Miller, Cyril Connolly, Stephen Spender and Arthur Koestler, and strangers who wrote to him out of the blue. This carefully selected volume of his correspondence provides an eloquent narrative of Orwells life, from his schooldays to his final illness.Orwells letters afford a unique and fascinating view of his thoughts on matters both personal, political and much in between, from poltergeists, to girls school songs and the art of playing croquet. In a note home to his mother from school, he reports having aufel fun after tea; much later we read of him choosing a pseudonym and smuggling a copy of Ulysses into the country. We catch illuminating glimpses of his family life: his son Richards developing teeth, the death of his wife Eileen and his own illness. His talent as a political writer comes to the fore in his descriptions of Barcelona during the Spanish Civil War, his opinions on bayonets, and on the chaining of German prisoners. And of course, letters to friends and his publisher chart the development and publication of some of the most famous novels in the English language, providing unparalleled insight into his views on his own work as well as that of his contemporaries.A Life in Letters features previously unpublished material, including letters which shed new light on a love that would haunt him for his whole life, as well as revealing the inspiration for some of his most famous characters. Presented for the first time in a dedicated volume, this selection of Orwells letters is an indispensible companion to his diaries.	2010-05-25	Random House						FIC000000
9781846553677	We, the Drowned	Carsten Jensen		An epic drama of adventure, courage, ruthlessness and passion by one of Scandinavia's most acclaimed storytellers. In 1848 a motley crew of Danish sailors sets sail from the small island town of Marstal to fight the Germans. Not all of them return - and those who do will never be the same again. Among them is the daredevil Laurids Madsen, who promptly escapes again into the anonymity of the high seas. As soon as he is old enough, his son Albert sets off in search of his missing father on a voyage that will take him to the furthest reaches of the globe and into the clutches of the most nefarious company. Bearing a mysterious shrunken head, and plagued by premonitions of bloodshed, he returns to a town increasingly run by women - among them a widow intent on liberating all men from the tyranny of the sea. From the barren rocks of Newfoundland to the lush plantations of Samoa, from the roughest bars in Tasmania, to the frozen coasts of northern Russia, We, The Drowned spans four generations, two world wars and a hundred years. Carsten Jensen conjures a wise, humorous, thrilling story of fathers and sons, of the women they love and leave behind, and of the sea's murderous promise.

9781847920096	The Last Stand,Custer, Sitting Bull, and the Battle of the Little Big Horn	Nathaniel Philbrick		'The whites want war and we will give it to them.' Sitting Bull This is the archetypal story of the American West. Whether it is cast as a tale of unmatched bravery in the face of impossible odds or of insane arrogance receiving its rightful comeuppance, Custer's Last Stand continues to captivate the imagination. Nathaniel Philbrick brilliantly reconstructs the build-up to the Battle of the Little Big Horn and the final eruption of violence in The Last Stand. The legendary figures dominate the events: George Armstrong Custer and Sitting Bull. No longer the fresh-faced 'Boy-General' of the Civil War, Custer was now mired in financial, professional and political problems. A clear and just cause had been replaced by ambiguity and frustration - by ill-fated efforts at peace treaties, treachery and compromises on both sides. Forced to take to the plains to feed themselves, and increasingly outraged by the government's policies towards them, the Sioux and Cheyenne became infused with a new sense of collective identity and purpose. Between six and eight thousand people came together in the largest ever gathering of Native Americans. If the government should be foolish enough to pursue them, they would stand and fight. Sitting Bull was in his mid-forties, His charisma and political savvy had enabled him to emerge as their leader. A vision he received during a Sun Dance - of soldiers falling from the sky - was widely understood to presage a great victory. Nathaniel Philbrick brings vividly to life all those involved - from the Oglala Sioux warrior Crazy Horse and Major Marcus Reno who led the first attack, to Libby Custer waiting with the other army wives at Fort Lincoln. He evokes too the history, geography and haunting beauty of the Great Plains and provides the finest account to date of what happened there - and why - at the end of June 1876.	2010	Random House						ZZZ000000
9781847920133	A History of Britain - Volume 2,The British Wars 1603 - 1776	Simon Schama		'Great Britain? What was that?' asks Simon Schama at the start of this, the second book of his epic three-volume journey into Britain's past. This volume, The British Wars, is a compelling chronicle of the changes that transformed every strand and stratum of British life, faith and thought from 1603 to 1776. Travelling up and down the country and across three continents, Schama explores the forces that tore Britain apart during two centuries of dynamic change - transforming outlooks, allegiances and boundaries. From the beginning of the British wars in July 1637, for 200 years battles raged on - both at home and abroad, on sea and on land, up and down the length of burgeoning Britain, across Europe, America and India. Most would be wars of faith - waged on wide-ranging grounds of political or religious conviction. But as wars of religious passions gave way to campaigns for profit, the British people did come together in the imperial enterprise of 'Britannia Incorporated'. The story of that great alteration is a story of revolution and reaction, inspiration and disenchantment, of progress and catastrophe, and Schama's evocative narrative brings it vividly to life.	2009-11-05	Bodley Head						ZZZ000000
9781847920140	HISTORY OF BRITAIN, A,FATE OF EMPIRE 1776-2001	Simon Schama		'While Britain was losing an empire, it was finding itself...' The compelling opening words to The Fate of the Empire, set the tone and agenda for the final stage of Simon Schama's epic voyage around Britain, her people and her past. Spanning two centuries, crossing the breadth of the empire and covering a vast expanse of topics - from the birth of feminism to the fate of freedom - he explores the forces that shaped British culture and character from 1776 to 2000. The story opens on the eve of a bloody revolution, but not a British one. The French Revolution never quite crossed the Channel, though its spirit of fiery defiance and Romantic idealism did, sparking off a round of radical revolts and reforms that gathered momentum over the coming century - from the Irish Rebellion to the Chartist Petition. The great question of the Victorian century was how the world's first industrial society could come through its growing pains without falling apart in social and political conflict. Would the machine age destroy or strengthen the institutions that held Britain together, from the family to the farm? And if the British Empire helped to make Britain stable and rich, did it live up to its promise to help the ruled as well as the rulers? On the way to answering these questions, The Fate of the Empire makes stops at both celebrations, like the Great Exhibition, and catastrophes, like the Irish potato famine and the Indian Mutiny. Amidst the military and economic shocks and traumas of the 20th century, and through the voices of Churchill, Orwell and H. G. Wells, it asks the question that is still with us - is the immense weight of our history a blessing or a curse, a gift or a millstone around the neck of our future? It is a vast compelling epic, made more so by the lively storytelling and big bold characters at the heart of the action. But alongside flamboyant heroes, like Nelson and Churchill, Schama recalls unsung heroines and virtually unknown enemies. Alongside the grand ideas, he exposes the grand illusions that cost untold lives. Schama looks head on at the facts and asks, 'What went wrong with the liberal dream?' The answers emerge in The Fate of the Empire, which reveals the living ideals of Britain's long history, 'a history that tied together social justice with bloody-minded liberty'.	2009	Random House						ZZZ000000
9781847920355	The case for God,what religion really means	Karen Armstrong		* The enormous popularity of books by Richard Dawkins, Christopher Hitchens, Sam Harris and others shows that despite the religious revival that is under way in many parts of the world, there is widespread confusion about the nature of religious truth. For the first time in history, a significantly large number of people want nothing to do with God. In the past people went to great lengths to experience a sacred reality that they called God, Brahman, Nirvana or Dao; indeed religion could be said to be the distinguishing characteristic of homo sapiens. But now militant atheists preach a gospel of godlessness with the zeal of Christian missionaries in the age of faith and find an eager audience. What has happened? * Karen Armstrong argues that historically atheism has rarely been a denial of the sacred itself but has nearly always rejected a particular conception of God. During the modern period, the Christians of the West developed a theology that was radically different from that of the pre-modern age. Tracing the history of faith from the Palaeolithic Age to the present, Armstrong shows that until recently there was no warfare between science and religion. But science has changed the conversation. The meaning of words such as belief, faith, and mystery has been entirely altered, so that atheists and theists alike now think and speak about God - and, indeed, reason itself - in a way that our ancestors would have found astonishing. * Why has the modern God become incredible? Has God a future in this age of aggressive scientific rationalism? Karen Armstrong suggests that if we draw creatively on the insights of the past, we can build a faith that speaks to the needs of our troubled and dangerously polarized world.	2009-08-06	Bodley Head						ZZZ000000

Buss		* Do women have sex simply to reproduce or display their affection? When clinical psychologist Cindy Meston and evolutionary psychologist David Buss joined forces to investigate the underlying sexual motivations of women, what they found astonished them.* Through the voices of real women, Meston and Buss reveal the motivations that guide women's sexual decisions and explain the deep-seated psychology and biology that often unwittingly drive women's desires sometimes in pursuit of health or pleasure, or sometimes for darker, disturbing reasons that a woman may not fully recognize. * Drawing on more than a thousand intensive interviews conducted solely for the book, as well as their pioneering research on physiological response and evolutionary emotions, Why Women Have Sex uncovers an amazingly complex and nuanced portrait of female sexuality. They delve into the use of sex as a defensive tactic against a mate's infidelity (protection), as a ploy to boost self-confidence (status), as a barter for gifts or household chores (resource acquisition), or as a cure for a migraine headache (medication).* Why Women Have Sex stands as the richest and deepest psychological understanding of female sexuality yet achieved and promises to inform every woman's (and her partner's) awareness of her relationship to sex and her sexuality.	2009	Bodley Head						ZZZ000000

We are natural-born essentialists - when it comes to pleasure, nothing is ever merely skin-deep. We are attracted, whether we know it or not, to the hidden aspects of things and people. Some teenagers enjoy cutting themselves with razors; some men pay good money to be spanked by prostitutes. The average Briton spends over a day a week watching television. The thought of sex with a virgin is intensely arousing to many men. Artwork can sell for millions of pounds. Food and alcohol are so compelling that they can come to dominate one's life. Young children enjoy playing with imaginary friends and can be comforted by security blankets. People slow their cars to look at gory accidents and go to sentimental movies that make them cry. In this revealing and witty account, Paul Bloom examines the science behind these curious desires, attractions and tastes, covering everything from the animal instincts of sex and food to the uniquely human taste for art, music and stories. Drawing on insights from child development, philosophy, neuroscience and behavioural economics, How Pleasure Works shows how certain universal habits of the human mind explain what we like and why we like it.	2010-07-15	RHCB						ZZZ000000
9781847921468	Death to the Dictator!,Witnessing Iran's Election and the Crippling of the Islamic Republic	Afsaneh Moqadam		For much of the world, Iran's 2009 summer of upheaval was an epic piece of theatre distantly observed. As citizens took to the streets in their millions to protest a stolen election and the regime that made it possible, and later, in smaller numbers, did battle with the shock troops of the Islamic Republic, so the country became effectively off limits for the world's media. This dramatic confrontation - and the deep divisions that opened among Iran's rulers as a result - have yet to be convincingly described for a Western audience. Afsaneh Moqadam observed and took part in the momentous events of that summer. Here, through the eyes of Mohsen, one of Tehran's young, courageous protesters, Moqadam tells the story of these historic months, from the mass marches that greeted the disputed election results to their brutal suppression by the hated Basij militia - and a dark aftermath of imprisonment, torture and a show trial worthy of Stalinist Russia. The result is an inspiring account of a confrontation that has signalled the fragility of the Islamic Republic and given pause to those Western leaders, notably President Barack Obama, who must grapple diplomatically with what may become the world's next nuclear power. Above all, Summer in Tehran is testament to the resilience of the human spirit, and its ability to strike fear in the hearts of despots.	2010-07-01	Random House						ZZZ000000
9781847940193	Borrowing Brilliance,The Six Steps to Business Innovation by Building on the Ideas of Others	David Kord Murray		Most of us think that outstanding success derives only from groundbreaking innovation. But we're wrong. In fact, many of the most successful business ideas of our time have come about when someone has borrowed and adapted an idea from somewhere else. In Borrowing Brilliance, David Kord Murray explains exactly how you can do the same. He demonstrates conclusively that new business ideas are simply combinations of existing ideas and then sets out to show how you can solve current problems and create new opportunities by learning where to look for ideas and answers. In the process, he takes you through a simple six-step programme that will help you not only create the right mindset to innovate, but test the ideas you come up with, and implement them successfully. His reassuring message throughout is that since brilliance can be borrowed, it lies within the reach of us all.	2010	Random House						ZZZ000000
9781847940278	Common Sense Rules,What You Really Need to Know about Business	Deborah Meaden		Deborah Meaden is known to millions for her straight-talking, no-nonsense approach on BBC2 s Dragons Den. A brilliant entrepreneur herself, she knows exactly what questions to ask and what pitfalls to avoid when deciding whether or not to invest in a new venture. In Common Sense Rules, Deborah shares the secrets of her success, drawing on years of experience to offer advice that is both candid and straightforward. How do you turn a bright idea into a commercial proposition? How do you inspire others to get on board? How do you ensure that a setback doesn t become a disaster? Above all, how do you make sure that you stay focused and achieve the goals you ve set yourself? Some of Deborah s insights come from observing the successes and the failures of others. Many more, though are drawn from her own life and business ventures. She shows, for example, how an early stint as a bingo caller in a holiday park gave her a crash course in customer relations. She frankly and honestly analyses why her first enterprise, which started so promisingly, turned sour. And she explains why turning down a multi-million pound offer for her chain of holiday parks was the best decision she ever made. As direct and to-the-point on the page as she is in the Den, Deborah Meaden is a superbly clear-sighted and experienced observer of business success, and her book is guaranteed both to inform and inspire.	2010-05-06	Random House						ZZZ000000
9781847940285	Confessions of a Radical Industrialist,How Interface Proved That You Can Build a Successful Business Without Destroying the Planet	Ray C. Anderson&Robin White		Ray Anderson's story is that rare thing in business: a genuine epiphany that led to real change in the way he ran his billion-dollar carpeting manufacturer, Interface, Inc. In 1994, after reading The Ecology of Commerce by Paul Hawken, Ray felt a 'spear in the chest': he realized that his company was plundering the environment and he needed to steer it on a new course. Since then, Interface has cut its greenhouse gas emissions by 82%, and the goal is to reach zero environmental footprint by 2020. Thoughtful and winning, Confessions of a Radical Industrialist shows how Anderson revolutionized his company, in the process bringing costs down, improving quality, making it one of Fortune's '100 Best Companies to Work For' - and driving up profits.	2009	Random House						ZZZ000000
9781847940421	How the Mighty Fall,And Why Some Companies Never Give In	Jim Collins		Decline can be avoided.Decline can be detected.Decline can be reversed.Amidst the desolate landscape of fallen great companies, Jim Collins began to wonder: How do the mighty fall? Can decline be detected early and avoided? How far can a company fall before the path toward doom becomes inevitable and unshakable? How can companies reverse course?In How the Mighty Fall, Collins confronts these questions, offering leaders the well-founded hope that they can learn how to stave off decline and, if they find themselves falling, reverse their course. Collins research projectmore than four years in durationuncovered five step-wise stages of decline: Stage 1: Hubris Born of SuccessStage 2: Undisciplined Pursuit of MoreStage 3: Denial of Risk and PerilStage 4: Grasping for SalvationStage 5: Capitulation to Irrelevance or DeathBy understanding these stages of decline, leaders can substantially reduce their chances of falling all the way to the bottom.Great companies can stumble, badly, and recover.Every institution, no matter how great, is vulnerable to decline. There is no law of nature that the most powerful will inevitably remain at the top. Anyone can fall and most eventually do. But, as Collins research emphasizes, some companies do indeed recoverin some cases, coming back even strongereven after having crashed into the depths of Stage 4.Decline, it turns out, is largely self-inflicted, and the path to recovery lies largely within our own hands. We are not imprisoned by our circumstances, our history, or even our staggering defeats along the way. As long as we never get entirely knocked out of the game, hope always remains. The mighty can fall, but they can often rise again.	2009-06-04	Random House Publishers India Pvt. Ltd.						ZZZ000000

9781848091511	Lost Voices from the Titanic,The Definitive Oral History	Nick Barratt		This is the story of the world's most infamous ship, told in the words of those who designed her, built her, sailed her and survived her sinking. Starting from its original conception and design by the owners and naval architects at the White Star Line through construction at Harland and Wolff's shipyards in Belfast, Nick Barratt explores the pre-history of the Titanic. He examines the aspirations of the owners, the realities of construction and the anticipation of the first sea-tests, revealing that the seeds of disaster were sown by the failure to implement sealed bulkheads. Barratt then looks at the Titanic's maiden voyage in April 1912, examining the lives of various passengers in more detail, from the first-class aristocrats to the families in third-class and steerage. Similarly, the stories of representatives from the White Star Line who were on board, as well as crew members, are told in their own words to offer a very different perspective on the voyage. Finally, the book examines the disaster itself when "Titanic" struck the iceberg and sank hours later. Survivors from passengers and crew recount what happened, taking us back in time to the full horror of that freezing Atlantic night when up to 1,520 people perished.	2010	Random House UK						ZZZ000000

9781903919583	When the rivers run dry,what happens when our water runs out?	Fred Pearce		Do you know how much water you use each day ' not just the 5 litres you may drink, or the 150 litres you guzzle to cook, wash, and flush the toilet with. It takes around 500 litres of water to grow the wheat to produce a loaf of bread. A staggering 11,000 litres to feed enough cows to make a quarter-pound hamburger. You could take 25 baths in the water it takes to grow the cotton for just one T-shirt. The South East of Britain has less water per capita than the Sudan or Ethiopia and while there is less and less rain our demand grows. Slowly but surely we're draining our rivers and hillside springs dry. Much more alarming, we import huge volumes of water in our dockside deliveries of wheat, beef, rice. And while our water crisis is relatively tranquil, it is repeated ' often in vastly more dangerous form ' across the world. That we face a world-wide crisis is no idle threat. Pearce's 15-year research into water issues has taken him all over the world. His vivid reportage reveals the personal stories behind failing rivers, barren fields, desertification, floods and water wars. His book gives a clear and terrifying picture of the consequences if no remedial action is taken, but also a brilliantly challenging explanation of the steps we must take to ensure the 'blue revolution' the world desperately needs.	2007-04-30	Eden Project Books						ZZZ000000

9781905211159	Crowdsourcing,How the Power of the Crowd is Driving the Future of Business	Jeff Howe		Jeff Howe coined the word Crowdsourcing in a 2006 article for Wired magazine to describe the way in which the Internet has broken down traditional employer/employee relationships to create vibrant new enterprises that are staffed by informal, often large gatherings of enthusiasts. A few weeks before the article hit the newsstands, a Google search for the word Crowdsourcing returned zero results. One month after the article appeared, the same search returned nearly 500,000 hits. These days anyone and everyone can write book reviews on Amazon, post videos on Youtube, come up with new uses for Google maps or design T-shirts for Threadless. What makes this phenomenon so remarkable is that it is starting to transform the way many companies operate and to change their relationship with their customers: iStockPhoto.com has revolutionised the world of digital photography; Cambrian House is having a profound impact on the way films get made; Second Life has created a vast, profitable business with only a few formal employees but thousands of dedicated contributors. Moreover this revolution is rapidly changing our culture, introducing a consumer democracy that has never existed before.Jeff Howe has now followed up his initial, ground-breaking article with months of research, and the result is a book that will define the next stage of the Internet revolution.	2009-04-02	Random House						ZZZ000000

It is a book with potential on a par with Execution, one that will change the way people in business do their jobs so they have the know-how to meet important performance goals and deliver the numbers.There is, in fact, no area of business more in need of fresh thinking than leadership, a hodge-podge of ideas that mainly focus on personal attributes such as an individual's vision, personality, character, presence, selfconfidence and innate intelligence. While all are obviously important, something big is missing: The know-how of running a business, the specific capabilities that affect profit and loss, cash flow and customer and employee satisfaction. In KNOW-HOW Ram Charan explains the eight essential skills that are the sine qua non of success:1. Positioning the business to make money: The ability to create a central idea that is clear, fits what customers want and that allows the business to be profitable.2. Detecting patterns in the external environment: Focusing on the key variables that impact the future direction of a business.3. Managing the social system: Creating the mechanism that pulls people in an organization together to make high quality decisions, coordinate actions and leverage peoples' time and knowledge. 4. Selecting (and deselecting) people: Accurately calibrating people, matching them to the job and making changes when the fit isn't right.5. Leading a team of direct reports: Getting high quality people to work together to create more than the sum of their parts.6. Setting goals: Deciding what the business can realistically achieve7. Setting priorities: The actions that need to be taken to keep the organization moving forward to meet its goals.8. Dealing with external constituencies: The outside power groups you don't control but that can directly impact your business, including major customers, Wall Street, government regulators, non-governmental organizations such as Greenpeace.	2007	Random House Business						ZZZ000000

It was called Tilism-e Hoshruba. Thewriters claimed that the tale had been passed down to them from story-tellers going back centuries:it was a part of the beloved oral epic, The Adventures of Amir Hamza which had come to theIndian subcontinent via Persia and had gained in popularity during the reign of Akbar, the Mughalemperor.The Tilism-e-Hoshruba is the subcontinent s first wholly indigenous Indo-Islamic fantasy epic.It tells the stories of Amir Hamza s military forces, his grandson and his loyal band of tricksters(masters of wit and disguise) as they go to war with Afrasiyab, the sorcerer who rules the magicalland of Hoshruba. Fantasy, the occult, adventure and romance play themselves out in a typicallyIndian setting as wizards, sorceresses, tricksters and royalty pitch themselves into the battle forHoshruba.

9788184001358	Quarantine	Rahul Mehta		About the Book : - Last week during one of our marathon telephone conversations my mother asked me which one of us, me or Frank, was the woman in our relationship. Neither of us, obviously, I said. That's what makes us gay. Very funny,my mom said. Someone on Oprah said that often gay couples have one person who plays the man and the other who plays the woman. So I was wondering which you were.Frank and I don't believe in hetero-normative gender roles, I told her. I knew my mom didn't know what hetero-normative meant, so I figured she'd drop it. So who does the cooking and cleaning? she asked. I could have truthfully answered neither of us. Instead I asked, Is that what you think womanhood is, Mom, cooking and cleaning? Rahul Mehta's stories are inhabited by young, gay Indian men on the wrong side of the American dream: adrift in the world, in complicated relationships, and with uncertain futures. Here are lovers who go to a nightclub deciding to cheat on each other; a couple slowly breaking up while they holiday; a young man who can't stop himself from burning up all his money; another who reluctantly prepares his grandmother for her US citizenship test. In a voice that's bare and wry, edgy and tender, Rahul Mehta writes of desire and family ties with rare candor. This is an outstanding debut.  About the Author : - Rahul Mehta was born and raised in West Virginia, USA. He is currently a lecturer in English at Alfred University.	2010	Random House Publishers India Pvt. Ltd.						ZZZ000000

9788189632144	Freud Along The Ganges Psychoanalytic Reflections Of The People And Culture Of India	Akhtar Salman		A collection of new and previously-published essays that sheds light on the intersections between psychoanalysis and Indic Studies. While Indian academics and clinicians have been familiar with psychoanalysis for many decades, they have kept this Western model of the mind separate from the spiritual and philosophical traditions of their own country. Freud Along the Ganges bridges this important lacuna in psychoanalytic and Indic studies by creating a new theoretical field where human motives are approached not only psychoanalytically but also from the perspective of the teachings of Buddha, Tagore, Gandhi, and Salman Rushdie. The authors of this collection show how the insights of these Indian masters give a new force to the Freudian discovery by providing a basis to better understand the social and psychological Indian makeup. The book begins by questioning the applicability of the psychoanalytic method to non-Western cultures. It then traces the history of the psychoanalytic movement in India from its onset while it emphasizes the intricate overlap between Indian existential and mystical traditions and psychoanalysis. Freud Along the Ganges offers a unique study of the ways that Indian thought and psychoanalysis illuminate and enrich each other.	2008	RAVE MEDIA						ZZZ000000

This remarkable guidebook for successful therapy is, as Yalom remarks, "an idiosyncratic mÉlange of ideas and techniques that I have found useful in my work. These ideas are so personal, opinionated, and occasionally original that the reader is unlikely to encounter them elsewhere. I selected the eighty-five categories in this volume randomly guided by my passion for the task rather than any particular order or system."

9780061686184	Belong to Me Intl	Marisa De Los Santos		In de los Santos's second novel (Love Walked In, 2006) Having moved out of New York City after the double whammy of a miscarriage and 9/11, Cornelia finds herself a shunned outsider among the community's perfect blond matrons. Particularly unwelcoming is her tightly wound neighbour Piper, who is as sharp-tongued as she is judgmental about fashion, flowers and childrearing. Cornelia does begin a fledgling friendship with another newcomer, Lake, a waitress who has moved from California to enroll her genius 13-year-old son Dev in a special school after his previous school punished him for being too smart. Dev suspects there might be more to the move, that Lake may be moving them closer to the mystery father he's never met. As much as Cornelia likes Lake, she senses Lake holding back at crucial moments and responds in kind. Meanwhile, Piper turns out to be a far more complicated woman than she seems on the surface. She drops everything (but her children) to care for her best friend Elizabeth, who's in the last stages of cancer. By the time Cornelia succeeds in becoming pregnant, she and Piper have grown surprisingly close, each opening her heart a little to the other. Days after Elizabeth dies, Piper's husband leaves her and she finds herself an outcast for continuing her (platonic) involvement with Elizabeth's mourning husband and children. In another development, Dev stumbles on the truth Lake has been hiding and learns the identity of his father. The father is stunned; Cornelia is devastated; and oh-so-sensitive, intelligent Dev is furious.	2008-04-01	HarperCollins						ZZZ000000

9780061956270	Freakonomics,A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything	Steven D. Levitt&Stephen J. Dubner		Which is more dangerous, a gun or a swimming pool? What do schoolteachers and sumo wrestlers have in common? Why do drug dealers still live with their moms? How much do parents really matter? What kind of impact did Roe v. Wade have on violent crime?These may not sound like typical questions for an economist to ask. But Steven D. Levitt is not a typical economist. He is a much heralded scholar who studies the stuff and riddles of everyday life-; from cheating and crime to sports and child rearing-; and whose conclusions regularly turn the conventional wisdom on its head. He usually begins with a mountain of data and a simple, unasked question. Some of these questions concern life-and-death issues; others have an admittedly freakish quality. Thus the new field of study contained in this book: freakonomics.Through forceful storytelling and wry insight, Levitt and co-author Stephen J. Dubner show that economics is, at root, the study of incentives-; how people get what they want, or need, especially when other people want or need the same thing. In Freakonomics, they set out to explore the hidden side of ... well, everything. The inner workings of a crack gang. The truth about real-estate agents. The myths of campaign finance. The telltale marks of a cheating schoolteacher. The secrets of the Ku Klux Klan.What unites all these stories is a belief that the modern world, despite a surfeit of obfuscation, complication, and downright deceit, is not impenetrable, is not unknowable, and-; if the right questions are asked-; is even more intriguing than we think. All it takes is a new way of looking. Steven Levitt, through devilishly clever and clear-eyed thinking, shows how to seethrough all the clutter. Freakonomics establishes this unconventional premise: If morality represents how we would like the world to work, then economics represents how it actually does work. It is true that readers of this book will be armed with enough riddles and stories to last a thousand cocktail parties. But Freakonomics can provide more than that. It will literally redefine the way we view the modern world.	2009-09-20	Harper Collins USA						ZZZ000000

The day before there had been a bank heist in which the thieves had gone into the city's labyrinthine storm water tunnel system to get beneath the bank before tunnelling upward.' Years later that story would become THE BLACK ECHO.'Moments. They kept coming. One morning an editor called me and told me to swing by a murder scene on my way to the office. Just like that, like I was picking up a coffee on the way to work. The murder was on Woodrow Wilson Drive in the Hollywood Hills. I went as instructed and got the story. I also got the place where I would put the home of the fictional detective [Harry Bosch] I had secretly begun writing about ...'

9780465081981	Stephen Hawking's Universe,The Cosmos Explained	David Filkin		Stephen Hawking’s A Brief History of Time has sold over 9 million copies worldwide. Now, in everyday language, Stephen Hawking’s Universe reveals step-by-step how we can all share his understanding of the cosmos, and our own place within it. Stargazing has never been the same since cosmologists discovered that galaxies are moving away from each other at an extraordinary speed. It was this understanding of the movement of galaxies that allowed scientists to develop a theory of how the universe was created—the Big Bang theory. Working with this theory, Stephen Hawking and other physicists felt challenged to come up with a scientific picture that would tackle the fundamental question: what is the nature of the universe? Stephen Hawking’s Universe charts this work and provides simple explanations for phenomena that arouse our curiosity. This work is a voyage of discovery with an astonishing set of conclusions that will enable us to understand how matter can be produced from nothing at all and will provide us with an explanation for the basis of our existence and that of everything around us.	1998-10-08	Basic Books						ZZZ000000

9780099532286	The Hills of Adonis: A Quest in Lebanon	Colin Thubron		The Hills of Adonisis not only a masterfully-written travel book but also a personal quest for meaning by the author. Ostensibly this is a book about Lebanon, finely written and deeply felt not the Lebanon that a Beirut businessman would recognize, but a coastline of small historic ports and a littoral of beautiful mountains. In this country, the ruins of Phoenician, Greek and Roman are among the most impressive in the world. Crusader castles and Arab palaces stand together in the hills, and the people are a unique medley of races and religions. For five hundred miles the author walked through the mountains, following tracks and rivers. His journey was not only a survey of a remarkable country, but a quest for the divinities of the region Astarte and Adonis, who held the secrets of death and rebirth in the ancient cults of Lebanon. He visited almost every place of cultural importance, and lived with the people along his way, recording strange remnants left over from the religion of Baalim and high places. The Hills of Adonisis both a travel book and a personal journal; a quest for meaning, a reflection on faith and reason and a poem on the joy and complexity of living.	2009-01-06	Random House UK						ZZZ000000

Burr must contend with shifting alliances, betrayal in his own camp and the distractions of the idealistic doctor LeilaWalcott, searching the jungle for medicinal plants.And the region is in the grip of emerald fever, swept by rumours of the fabled lost city of ElVerde. Marxist guerrillas, right-wing death squads and Indian tribes are locked in an increasingly bitter struggle for the forestąs wealth. The carnage mounts until the very survival of the rainforest is at stake and Burr finds himself fighting desperately - for much more than a paycheck.	2007-05-07	Bantam Books						ZZZ000000

9780712668460	The Decline and Fall of the British Empire	Piers Brendon		A comprehensive, scholarly and fascinating study of the end of the British Empire. No empire has been larger or more diverse than the British Empire. At its apogee in the 1930s, 42 million Britons governed 500 million foreign subjects. Britannia ruled the waves, and a quarter of the earth’s surface was coloured red on the map. Where Britain’s writ did not run directly, its influence, sustained by matchless industrial and commercial sinews, was often paramount. Yet no empire (except for the Russian) disappeared more swiftly. Within a generation, this mighty structure sank almost without trace leaving behind a scatter of sea-girt dependencies and a ghost of empire — the Commonwealth. Equally, it can be claimed that Britain bequeathed its former colonies economic foundations, a cultural legacy, a sporting spirit, a legal code and a language more ubiquitous than Latin ever was. Full of vivid particulars, brief lives, telling anecdotes, comic episodes, symbolic moments and illustrative vignettes,The Decline and Fallof the British Empire evokes remote places as well as distant times.	2008	Vintage						ZZZ000000

9780593064177	The Inheritance	David E. Sanger		After seven years covering the White House for the New York Times, Chief Washington Correspondent David E. Sanger offers a clear, detailed and accessible analysis of the Bush administration's legacy, its few successes, and its stunning string of failures, many of them the collateral damage of the decision to invest so much of America, and Britain's, future on what once seemed like an easy mission in Iraq. Now, from rebuilding Afghanistan to preventing Iran and North Korea from becoming nuclear-armed states, cracking down on the proliferation of nuclear renegades, and reducing economic indebtedness to India and China, the challenges facing Barack Obama are more complex than those facing any other incoming president of the last half century. Mapping the political landscape that Bush now vacates, this book examines the international arenas that will remain the focus of the entire western world throughout the years to come. 'Somehow David Sanger has broken through the secrecy and the government gobbledygook to tell us how we got to where we are and the choices this leaves for the next administration. He reveals inside stuff that we have never heard in detail that will surprise and sometimes shock, yet he has framed it all in language that the specialist will appreciate and the layman can understand. One of the most important books of the year.' - Bob Schieffer, Chief Washington Correspondent, CBS News	2009-01-30	BANTAM PRESS						ZZZ000000

9780307339096	Magnificent Mind at Any Age,Natural Ways to Unleash Your Brain's Maximum Potential	Daniel G. Amen		It all starts with your brain: how you think, how you feel, how you interact with others, and how well you succeed in realizing your goals and dreams. When your brain works right, so do you. When it’s out of balance, you feel frustrated, or worse. Yet amid all the advice that bombards us daily about how to keep the rest of our body strong and healthy, we hear very little about how to keep the most complex and magnificent organ of all—the human brain—in top working order.Based on the most up-to-date research, as well as on Dr. Daniel Amen’s more than twenty years of treating patients at the Amen Clinics, where he and his associates pioneered the use of brain imaging in clinical practice, Magnificent Mind at Any Age does exactly that. Dr. Amen shows how many of the traditional approaches to overcoming the mind-centered challenges that hold us back—try harder, work longer, find the sheer willpower—either do not work or may make our problems worse. The true key to satisfaction and success at any age is a healthy brain. By optimizing our brain function we can all develop these qualities of a magnificent mind enjoyed by the world’s most successful and happiest people: • Increased memory and concentration• The ability to maintain warm and satisfying relationships• Undiminished sexual desire and performance• Goal-oriented perseverance• Better impulse control and mastery over potential addictions• Free-flowing creativity and the ability to relax and enjoy life’s pleasuresTo achieve this, as Dr. Amen explains here in clearly accessible language, we have a range of options available, including proper diet, natural supplements and vitamins, exercise, positive thinking habits, and, if needed, medication. In addition to revealing how we can all take advantage of such strategies to enjoy the benefits of a balanced and healthy brain at every stage of our lives, Dr. Amen also pinpoints specific ways to tailor behavior, nutrition, and lifestyle to deal effectively with common mental challenges such as memory problems, anxiety and depression, attention deficit disorder, and insomnia.Whether you’re in the midst of a demanding career or are looking forward to an active and richly rewarding retirement, Magnificent Mind at Any Age can give you the edge you need to live every day to your fullest potential.	2008-12-02	Harmony						ZZZ000000

9780307406880	Against us,the new face of America's enemies in the Muslim world	Jim Sciutto		In 2002 Jim Sciutto began filing in-depth reports on the Middle East for ABC News. Now, after nearly 100 assignments in Muslim countries, Sciutto brings back this disturbing truth: the Al-Qaedainspired view of an evil America bent on destroying Islam has moved from the fringes to the mainstream. Today, a surprising number of America's enemies are not wild-eyed fanatics, but moderatesoften middle-class and well educated, frequently young, many motivated by political convictions more than religious belief. Sciutto profiles a cross-section of people in the Arab world, including a former Al-Qaeda jihadi turned electrician in Saudi Arabia, a Jordanian college student willing to risk his life by killing Americans in Baghdad, a Christian woman who supports Hezbollah in Lebanon, bitter pro-democracy advocates in Egypt who feel betrayed by the United States, and British-born Muslim terrorists living in London. The result is an alarming portrait of the depth and scope of anti-American sentiment. Opposing America has become the unifying rallying cry for a rapidly growing pan-Arab nationalist movement. Conspiracy theories abound as Muslims begin to feel they are targeted by America, their political autonomy sabotaged. The Iraq war has become one of the most powerful recruiting tools for enemies of the United States. Yet there is hope for America to turn the tide of hate. Sciutto talks with a young female student in Afghanistan who is cautiously optimistic that the United States will not fail her country in the rebuilding effortand with a reformed jihadi in London who is finding ways to counsel young British Muslims away from their hatred of America. Democratic ideals are still held in high esteem, even as America's perceived actions against Muslims are not. Against Usis an urgent wake-up call for all Americansand in particular those charged with formulating U.S. foreign policyto rebuild relations with the Arab world and restore confidence in American values.	2008-09-09	Harmony Books						ZZZ000000
9780345470218	The Last Theorem	Arthur Charles Clarke&Frederik Pohl		Two of science fiction’s most renowned writers join forces for a storytelling sensation. The historic collaboration between Frederik Pohl and his fellow founding father of the genre, Arthur C. Clarke, is both a momentous literary event and a fittingly grand farewell from the late, great visionary author of 2001: A Space Odyssey.The Last Theorem is a story of one man’s mathematical obsession, and a celebration of the human spirit and the scientific method. It is also a gripping intellectual thriller in which humanity, facing extermination from all-but-omnipotent aliens, the Grand Galactics, must overcome differences of politics and religion and come together . . . or perish. In 1637, the French mathematician Pierre de Fermat scrawled a note in the margin of a book about an enigmatic theorem: “I have discovered a truly marvelous proof of this proposition which this margin is too narrow to contain.” He also neglected to record his proof elsewhere. Thus began a search for the Holy Grail of mathematics–a search that didn’t end until 1994, when Andrew Wiles published a 150-page proof. But the proof was burdensome, overlong, and utilized mathematical techniques undreamed of in Fermat’s time, and so it left many critics unsatisfied–including young Ranjit Subramanian, a Sri Lankan with a special gift for mathematics and a passion for the famous “Last Theorem.”When Ranjit writes a three-page proof of the theorem that relies exclusively on knowledge available to Fermat, his achievement is hailed as a work of genius, bringing him fame and fortune. But it also brings him to the attention of the National Security Agency and a shadowy United Nations outfit called Pax per Fidem, or Peace Through Transparency, whose secretive workings belie its name. Suddenly Ranjit–together with his wife, Myra de Soyza, an expert in artificial intelligence, and their burgeoning family–finds himself swept up in world-shaking events, his genius for abstract mathematical thought put to uses that are both concrete and potentially deadly. Meanwhile, unbeknownst to anyone on Earth, an alien fleet is approaching the planet at a significant percentage of the speed of light. Their mission: to exterminate the dangerous species of primates known as homo sapiens.	2008-08-05	Ballantine Books/DelRey						ZZZ000000

9780385526104	No One Sees God,The Dark Night of Atheists and Believers	Michael Novak		Surveying the contemporary religious landscape, the division between atheist and believer seems stark. However, having long struggled to understand the purpose of life and the meaning of suffering, Michael Novak finds the reality of spiritual life far different from the rhetorical war presented by bestselling atheists and the defenders of the faith who oppose them.In No One Sees God, Novak brilliantly recasts the tired debate pitting faith against reason. Both the atheist and the believer experience the same “dark night” in which God’s presence seems absent, he argues, and the conflict between faith and doubt stems not from objective differences, but from divergent attitudes toward the unknown. Drawing from his lifelong passion for philosophy and his personal struggles with belief, he shows that, far from being irrational, the spiritual perspective actually provides the most satisfying answers to the eternal questions of meaning. Faith is a challenge at times, but it nonetheless offers the only fully coherent response to the human experience.Ultimately, No One Sees God offers believers and unbelievers the opportunity to find common ground by acknowledging the complicated reality of the human struggle with doubt. Novak provides a stirring defense of the Christian worldview, while sidestepping the shrill tone that so often characterizes the discussion of faith, and given the challenges faced in the present age, all who value liberty will find hope in his new way of conversing.	2008-08-05	Doubleday						ZZZ000000

9781400050000	The deviant's advantage,how fringe ideas create mass markets	Ryan Mathews&Watts Wacker		Don’t be afraid of deviants. They just may save your business.In today's challenging and sometimes puzzling business environment, deviance equals innovation--the kind of breakthrough thinking that creates new markets and tumbles traditional ones. In The Deviant's Advantage, two of America's most respected futurists show how this deviance proceeds along a traceable trajectory, explaining how and why:• Christian fundamentalism morphed from college Bible studies to Republican party king-making• Reebok cares more about what’s on the feet of kids in Detroit and Philadelphia than what the so-hip-it-hurts set is wearing in New York or on Rodeo Drive • Hugh Hefner, the creator of Playboy, transformed into a cultural icon with decidedly Puritan sensibilitiesTomorrow's breakthrough concept is lurking out there right now in the mind of a deviant individual. Your choice is simple: find it and exploit it or be buried by those who do.	2004-03-23	Three Rivers Press						ZZZ000000
9781400080939	The art of pricing,how to find the hidden profits to grow your business	Rafi Mohammed		Want to make a bad year better or turn a good year into a blockbuster? Stop leaking profits and discover the untapped gold mine that exists in your products. The Art of Pricing is the first practical, easy-to-understand guide to solving one of the most important dilemmas in business: how to use price to uncover a product’s hidden profits and find new opportunities for growth.When it comes to setting prices for products and services, even the most sophisticated businesspeople often rely on formulas and seat-of-the-pants instinct, based on what the competition is charging, marking up costs, and doing things as they’ve always been done. The result is that businesses of all sizes, from start-ups to the Fortune 100, leave money on the table. In The Art of Pricing, Rafi Mohammed, one of the world’s leading experts on pricing strategy, shows:• The astonishing impact that small changes to a pricing strategy can have on the bottom line• How the right pricing strategy can boost profits and grow your customer base • Why the right way to think about pricing is as a series of easy-to-implement strategies that allow companies to serve and profit from the largest possible customer base• Why the art of pricing involves understanding and capitalizing on the fact that different customer segments are willing to pay different prices for the same product • Why an effective pricing strategy is not about price gouging but one that incorporates fairness into every important pricing decisionThe Art of Pricing will be the invaluable missing link for people running companies, departments, divisions, and product lines, as well as for those in sales and marketing. Dr. Mohammed shows that an effective pricing strategy helps complete the circle by reaping the rewards due for the enormous effort, creativity, and investment made in developing and marketing products and services. Using a range of examples, from neighborhood restaurants to huge companies like Ford, he shows the importance of not falling short—and shortchanging yourself—when it comes to the heretofore little understood art of pricing.

9780307405258	Rapture for the geeks,when AI outsmarts IQ	Richard Dooling		Will the Geeks inherit the earth?If computers become twice as fast and twice as capable every two years, how long is it before they’re as intelligent as humans? More intelligent? And then in two more years, twice as intelligent? How long before you won’t be able to tell if you are texting a person or an especially ingenious chatterbot program designed to simulate intelligent human conversation? According to Richard Dooling in Rapture for the Geeks—maybe not that long. It took humans millions of years to develop opposable thumbs (which we now use to build computers), but computers go from megabytes to gigabytes in five years; from the invention of the PC to the Internet in less than fifteen. At the accelerating rate of technological development, AI should surpass IQ in the next seven to thirty-seven years (depending on who you ask). We are sluggish biological sorcerers, but we’ve managed to create whiz-bang machines that are evolving much faster than we are. In this fascinating, entertaining, and illuminating book, Dooling looks at what some of the greatest minds have to say about our role in a future in which technology rapidly leaves us in the dust. As Dooling writes, comparing human evolution to technological evolution is “worse than apples and oranges: It’s appliances versus orangutans.” Is the era of Singularity, when machines outthink humans, almost upon us? Will we be enslaved by our supercomputer overlords, as many a sci-fi writer has wondered? Or will humans live lives of leisure with computers doing all the heavy lifting? With antic wit, fearless prescience, and common sense, Dooling provocatively examines nothing less than what it means to be human in what he playfully calls the age of b.s. (before Singularity)—and what life will be like when we are no longer alone with Mother Nature at Darwin’s card table. Are computers thinking and feeling if they can mimic human speech and emotions? Does processing capability equal consciousness? What happens to our quaint beliefs about God when we’re all worshipping technology? What if the human compulsion to create ever more capable machines ultimately leads to our own extinction? Will human ingenuity and faith ultimately prevail over our technological obsessions? Dooling hopes so, and his cautionary glimpses into the future are the best medicine to restore our humanity.	2008-09-30	Harmony Books						ZZZ000000

The man responsible is serving time in a Florida prison.

India: The Rise of an Asian Giant charts the important features of India's development since its independence in 1947, assessing those forces that have contributed to the nation's growth as well as those that have impeded it. Through the lens of India's past, Dietmar Rothermund offers a new perspective on India today and a fascinating look into the nation's future. India: The Rise of an Asian Giant explores the diverse roots of India's economic robustness, from agriculture to the export boom. Rothermund looks closely at the country's democratic system, nuclear decisions, and alliance with the U.S. against terror. In his review of social changes, he discusses the institution of caste, the rise of a new middle class, the persistence of poverty, the media and Bollywood, and the significance of the global diaspora of twenty million Indians. In sum, he offers an impressive profile of India, an Asian giant whose role in the world's future will surely be unique and important.

9781416502678	Ingerland,Travels with a Football Nation	Mark Perryman		The England Supporters Club boasts more members than those of several other European nations combined, many of whom travel to every England away game. And while young working-class white men still make up the majority of fans, the hooligans of the 1970s and 80s are today much more likely to be singing and chanting alongside black, Asian and female supporters, and the conduct -- not to mention the reputation -- of England supporters abroad has changed out of all recognition in recent years. Both celebration and exploration, Ingerland is a thought-provoking and evocative insight into what inspires the devotion of the England football fan. Packed with interviews with England supporters of all ages and backgrounds, each of whom gives their own individual voice to the debate, this is both a fascinating social document and a passionate personal testament to our national game.	2010	Pocket Books - Uk						ZZZ000000
9781847378859	The Devil and Sherlock Holmes,Tales of Murder, Madness, and Obsession	David Grann		As Sherlock Holmes once conceded to Dr. Watson, 'If we could fly out of that window hand in hand, hover over this great city, gently remove the roofs and peep in at the queer things which are going on, the strange coincidences, the planning, the cross-purposes, the wonderful chain of events, working through generations and leading to the most outré results, it would make all fiction with its conventionalities and foreseen conclusions most stale and unprofitable.' And with such a spirit for investigation and discovery does David Grann set out in The Devil and Sherlock Holmes to unravel the truth of twelve great, real-life mysteries. Although Holmes is the subject of just one of the mesmerizing stories in this collection, all twelve contain elements of intrigue. Many of the protagonists are sleuths: a Polish detective trying to determine whether an author planted clues to a real murder in his post-modern novel; an arson investigator racing to prove whether a man about to be executed is innocent; a legendary French con man questioning whether he is the one who is suddenly being conned; and scientists stalking a sea monster. Unlike the adventures of Sherlock Holmes, these tales are all true. The protagonists are mortal and pieces of the puzzle often elude them. Some of the characters are driven to deception and murder. Others go mad. But ultimately the stories contained in The Devil and Sherlock Holmes shed light on the human condition, and why some people on this earth devote themselves to good and others to evil. As Holmes put it, 'Life is infinitely stranger than anything which the mind of man could invent'.	2010	Simon & Schuster, Limited						ZZZ000000

9780670031634	My passage from India,a filmaker's journey from Bombay to Hollywood and beyond	Ismail Merchant		Ismail Merchant is known for the extraordinary films he's produced with the American director James Ivory, among them A Room with a View, Howards End, and Remains of the Day. But when he's not making these lush, expensive costume dramas, he's making movies in his native India. In My Passage from Indiahe takes us on a guided tour of how a middle-class Muslim named Noormohamed Abdul Rehman became an internationally acclaimed producer with a string of award-winning films to his credit. My Passage from Indiais a fascinating look at the Bombay film industry-called Bollywood-from the 1950s through today, and how Holly- and Bollywood have intersected through Merchant's film career. Merchant amusingly recounts how his passion for movies was born in the streets of Bombay. He details his precocious wanderings from London to New York, where he first encountered his lifetime collaborator, James Ivory, and raised money for his first short film, and ultimately to Hollywood. Merchant lovingly recalls the circumstances of the movies he's shot in India, the Western stars he cast-and entertained-from James Mason to Jeanne Moreau to Vivien Leigh to Greta Scacchi, and the vast obstacles that his home country often presented-along with the movie magic that was the frequent result of his efforts. With seventy-five photographs and a fabulous narrative, My Passage from Indiais a vivid memoir and colorful account of the lasting impact India has had on the thing Ismail Merchant does best: filmmaking.	2002	Viking Studio						ZZZ000000

9780330280235	Slowly down the Ganges	Eric Newby		Eric Newby has never been bedeviled by practicality. Hence this 1,200-mile journey down the Ganges River, which the author undertook in 1963 in the company of his wife and an ever-changing crew of Indian retainers. What moved him to take the trip? Partly it was the memory of his military service in India more than two decades before. And as he confesses, Newby has a lifelong and perhaps congenital love of rivers: "I like exploring them. I like the way in which they grow deeper and wider and dirtier but always, however dirty they become, managing to retain some of the beauty with which they were born." Few rivers grow quite as dirty as the Ganges, which also goes by such nicknames as Atula ("Peerless"), Savitri ("Stimulator"), and Bhinna-brahmanda-darpini ("Taking pride in the broken egg of Brahma"). And few accounts of this mighty waterway could possibly be as acute and hilarious as Slowly down the Ganges, which Newby first published in 1966.	1983	Picador						ZZZ000000
9780330300056	Before she met me	Julian Barnes		Graham was an historian: he was meant to be an expert on the past. But there were aspects of it, he discovered, that couldnāt be subdued, that simply carried on, lively and painful, as if they were the present. He began to mind. He minded very much indeed. While those around him look on ā with concern, with contempt, with amusement ā Grahamās meticulous passion gradually begins to run out of control. Julian Barnes presents an unnerving version of sexual jealousy and shows it to be not just living, but reasonable, ordinary, funny, dangerous and consuming.	1986	Picador						ZZZ000000

9780330464512	Silks	Dick Francis&Felix Francis		When defence barrister Geoffrey Mason hears the judge's guilty verdict, he quietly hopes that a long and arduous custodial sentence will be handed down to his arrogant young client. That Julian Trent only receives eight years seems all too lenient. Little does Mason expect that he'll be seeing Trent again much sooner than he'd ever imagined. Setting aside his barrister's wig, Mason heads to Sandown to don his racing silks. An amateur jockey, his true passion is to be found in the saddle, on a thoroughbred, pounding the turf. But when a fellow rider is brutally murdered ' a pitchfork driven through his chest ' the prime suspect is champion jockey Steve Mitchell and the evidence is overwhelming. Mason, reluctant to heed Mitchell's pleas for legal advice, soon finds himself at the centre of a sinister web of threat and intimidation and is left fighting a battle of right and wrong, and more immediately, a battle of life and death'Ś his own.	2009-07-01	Pan Macmillan						ZZZ000000

9780330450546	Between the Assassinations	Aravind Adiga		Full of fresh humour and wry observation, a small town in the south of India is conceived and mapped with brilliant precision Kittur is Indiaâ€™s south-western coast, in between Goa and Calicut â€“ a small, undistinguished everytown. Here, an illiterate Muslim boy working at the train station finds himself tempted by an Islamic terrorist; a Dalit bookseller is arrested for selling a copy of The Satanic Verses; a rich, spoiled, half-caste student decides to explode a bomb in college; a sexologist has to find a cure for a young boy with a mysterious disease that may be AIDS. Across class, religion, occupation and preoccupation, Kittur is mapped. What emerges is the moral biography of an Indian town in the seven-year period between the assassinations of Prime Minister Gandhi and her son Rajiv. With the cartographerâ€™s precision and the novelistâ€™s humanity Aravind Adiga composes a group portrait of ordinary Indians in a time of extraordinary transformation. Keenly observed and finely detailed, Between the Assassinations is a triumph of the voice and imagination.	2008	Picador						ZZZ000000

9780330448734	The Smell of the Continent	Richard Mullen&James Munson		"I remember being much amused last year, when landing at Calais," wrote Mrs. Frances Trollope in her 1835 book,Paris and the Parisians, "at the answer made by an old traveler to a novice . . . making his first voyage. 'What a dreadful smell!' said the uninitiated stranger . . . 'It is the smell of the continent, sir!' replied the man of experience. And so it was." Historians James Munson and Richard Mullen examine just what it was about the smell of the continent that so attracted British travelers in the hundred years from the fall of Napoleon to the outbreak of the First World War. It was the first time in history that the British, en masse, set out to discover Europe. Drawing on contemporary accounts, diaries, and letters, Munson and Mullen offer a compelling portrait of the Victorians abroad, many of them convinced that their country was not only vastly superior but also the envy of the world. Their attitudes to foreign food, modes of transport and habits were often as uncharitable then as now and complaints about "beastly abroad" abound. But there were also those intrepid souls who were genuinely interested in other countries what they could learn from them.The Smell of the Continentvividly reveals that the gulf between the "traveler" and the "tourist" was as wide in our great-grandparents' time as it is today.	2010-08-01	Macmillan UK						ZZZ000000

9780330485258	A Writer's People,Ways of Looking and Feeling	V. S. Naipaul		The Nobel Prize winner writes candidly about what has shaped his interpretation of literature and the world â€˜My purpose is not literary criticism or biography. I wish only to set out the writing and ways of seeing to which I was exposed.â€™ For the â€˜serious travellerâ€™, one who is fully engaged with the world, there can be no single view. So here is colonial Trinidad (the early Derek Walcott and Naipaulâ€™s own father), to which is added the culture of school (Flaubert and the classical world). There is England, where with the help of friends the writer seeks to make his way, and inevitably for a colonial Indian there is India, to be approached through the residue of Indian culture and the scattered memories of nineteenth-century immigrants, leading to a special understanding of Mahatma Gandhi. Part meditation, part remembrance, A Writerâ€™s People is a privileged insight, full of gentleness, humour and feeling, into the mind of one of our greatest writers. â€˜The greatest writer now living in Britain. His courage in seeing and telling the truth represents a level of high seriousness that has all but vanishedâ€™ Sunday Times â€˜Essential reading . . . it offers the insights and observations â€“ on literature, history and cultural sensibility â€“ of an honest and truly global thinkerâ€™ Evening Standard	2008-09-01	Picador						ZZZ000000

9780330514026	Evidence of Sus-picion	Amitava Kumar		Not everyone is innocent but 95 per cent are Bureaucratic in its convolutions and brutal in its deceptions, the war on terror has had an impact on our lives that we do not yet understand. We sense it. A growing claustrophobia, wariness, suspicion, the stickiness of constant surveillance. But for those who are actually entangled in it, the trap has teeth and they are fierce. Author and teacher Amitava Kumar examines the mangled lives of some of those who tripped.  In a US court Hemant Lakhani, an old man with a congenital heart condition, stands trial for selling a fake missile to an FBI informant; in another court Shahawar Matin Siraj, inveigled by the FBI into a conspiracy to bomb a subway, is sentenced to thirty years in prison. In New Delhi Kumar interviews S.A.R. Geelani, the mild-mannered professor apprehended for the 2001 Parliament attack, jailed and tortured. He also tries to speak to Tabassum Guru, the wife of the man on death row for the same attack, at the Sopore hospital in which she works. A few kilometres away, in Srinagar, he visits an army camp, where he sees the peculiarities that develop in an everyday battle-zone that is also a living, working city. And, he catalogues, with the criticâ€™s compass and a curatorâ€™s zeal, the fierce renewal in art and literature that has evolved out of the war.  Spanning the subcontinents of India and the USA, part reportage, part philosophy, part protest, this is a book whose importance cannot be exaggerated. Its intellectual power and moral force will keep the reader pinned to the page.	2010	Picador India						ZZZ000000

9780553816013	Holy cow!,an Indian adventure	Sarah Macdonald		“India is like Wonderland. In this other universe everyone seems mad and everything is upside down, back to front and infuriatingly bizarre . . .”In her twenties Sarah Macdonald backpacked around India and came away with a lasting impression of heat, pollution, and poverty. So when an airport beggar read her palm and told her she would return to India -- and for love -- she screamed, “Never!” and gave the country, and him, the finger. But eleven years later, the prophecy comes true. When the love of Macdonald’s life is posted to India, she quits her dream job to move to the most polluted city on earth, New Delhi. For Macdonald this seems like the ultimate sacrifice for love, and it almost kills her, literally. Just settled, she falls dangerously ill with double pneumonia, an experience that compels her to face some serious questions about her own fragile mortality and inner spiritual void. “I must find peace in the only place possible in India,” she concludes. “Within.” Thus begins her journey of discovery through India in search of the meaning of life and death.Holy Cowis Sarah Macdonald’s often hilarious chronicle of her adventures in a land of chaos and contradiction, of encounters with Hinduism, Islam and Jainism, Sufis, Sikhs, Parsis, and Christians, and a kaleidoscope of yogis, swamis, and Bollywood stars. From spiritual retreats and crumbling nirvanas to war zones and New Delhi nightclubs, it is a journey that only a woman on a mission to save her soul, her love life -- and her sanity -- can survive.	2004-01-03	Bantam						ZZZ000000

9780071067263	Benjamin Graham Building A Profession	Jason Zweig		Benjamin Graham is widely known as the father of Value Investing, and mentor to Warren Buffett. But Graham made another critically important contribution by advocating that securities analysts should meet minimum requirements of knowledge, and be held to high standards of ethical conduct in short, that the profession should be treated as seriously as other fields of study, like accounting, medicine or law. Benjamin Graham and the Birth of the Professional Financial Analyst showcases Graham's important contribution to remaking investment analysis as a profession. This fascinating collection spanning 30 years offers us valuable perspectives on investing and financial markets many as vital in the present day as they were in Grahams own tumultuous mid-twentieth century and reveals the evolution of Grahams passionate belief in the creation of a financial profession and a science of financial analysis.	2010	McGraw-Hill Education (India) Pvt Ltd						ZZZ000000

We all seek meaning at work: purpose, fulfillment, contribution, connection, value, and hope. Of course we find meaning in many settings but the organizations in which we labor are a primary setting for not only for accomplishing assignments but for finding an abiding sense of purpose and fulfillment. Thus work becomes a universal setting in which we seek to fulfill the universal search for meaning.	2010	McGraw-Hill Education (India) Pvt Ltd						ZZZ000000

9780060931803	The Map That Changed the World,William Smith and the Birth of Modern Geology	Simon Winchester		In 1793, a canal digger named William Smith made a startling discovery. He found that by tracing the placement of fossils, which he uncovered in his excavations, one could follow layers of rocks as they dipped and rose and fell -- clear across England and, indeed, clear across the world -- making it possible, for the first time ever, to draw a chart of the hidden underside of the earth. Determined to expose what he realized was the landscape's secret fourth dimension, Smith spent twenty-two years piecing together the fragments of this unseen universe to create an epochal and remarkably beautiful hand-painted map. But instead of receiving accolades and honors, he ended up in debtors' prison, the victim of plagiarism, and virtually homeless for ten years more. Finally, in 1831, this quiet genius -- now known as the father of modern geology -- received the Geological Society of London's highest award and King William IV offered him a lifetime pension.The Map That Changed the World is a very human tale of endurance and achievement, of one man's dedication in the face of ruin. With a keen eye and thoughtful detail, Simon Winchester unfolds the poignant sacrifice behind this world-changing discovery.	2002-07-18	HarperCollins						ZZZ000000

When she hires Spenser to investigate her grandson Jared Clark's alleged involvement in school shooting, Spenser is led into an investigation that grows more harrowing at every turn. Though seven people were killed in cold blood, and despite being name as a co-conspirator by the other shooter, Mrs. Ellsworth is convinced of her grandson's innocence. Jared's parents are resigned to his fate, and the boy himself doesn't seem to care whether he goes to prison for a crime he might not have committed. As the probe goes on, Spenser finds himself up against a number of roadblocks - from the school officials who don't want him investigating, to Jared's own parents, who are completely indifferent to the boy's defence. Ultimately Spenser discovers a web of blackmail and some heavy-duty indiscretions-and a truth too disturbing to contemplate. Before the case reaches its unfortunate end, Spenser is forced to make a series of difficult decisions-with fatal consequences.	2006	No Exit Press						ZZZ000000

9781842124864	Hitler and the Holocaust,how and why the Holocaust happened	Robert S. Wistrich		Robert Wistrich begins by exploring the origins of anti-Semitism in Europe, and especially in Germany, to try to explain how millions of Jews came to be killed systematically by the Third Reich. In the process of relating these events, he provides new and incisive answers to a number of central questions concerning the Shoah that have emerged over recent years: who, inside and outside Nazi Germany, knew that Jews were being murdered; how responsibility for the genocide should be divided between Hitler himself and ordinary Germans; and how historians have tried to make sense of the Holocaust. The book concludes by considering the legacy of Nazi crimes since 1945: the Nuremburg trials, the impact of the Holocaust on Diaspora Jewry (particularly in Israel and America), and the rise of neo-Nazism and Holocaust-denial.	2002-06-20	Phoenix						ZZZ000000

Bruce Lawrence’s work is a beautifully written and, in these increasingly troubled times, invaluable introduction to and exploration of the core sacred text of Islam.	2007-02-08	Atlantic Monthly Press						ZZZ000000

9780307341518	Know-how,the 8 skills that separate people who perform from those who don't	Ram Charan		The new grand theory of leadership by Ram Charan . . . The breakthrough book that links know-how—the skills of people who know what they are doing— with the personal and psychological traits of the successful leader.How often have you heard someone with a commanding presence deliver a bold vision that turned out to be nothing more than rhetoric and hot air? All too often we mistake the appearance of leadership for the real deal. Without a doubt, intelligence, vision, and the ability to communicate are important. But something big is missing: the know-how of running a business—the capacity to take it in the right direction, do the right things, make the right decisions, deliver results, and leave the people and the business better off than they were before.For well over four decades, Ram Charan has been learning in the most visceral way the underlying reasons why leaders succeed and fail. As one of the most influential advisers to top management teams of leading companies around the world, he has had a front-row seat to observe the cause and effect of leadership practices and behaviors.Ram Charan’s insight into the real content of leadership provides you with the eight fundamental skills needed for success in the twenty-first century: • Positioning (and, when necessary, repositioning) your business by zeroing in on the central idea that meets customer needs and makes money• Connecting the dots by pinpointing patterns of external change ahead of others• Shaping the way people work together by leading the social system of your business• Judging people by getting to the truth of a person• Molding high-energy, high-powered, high-ego people into a working team of leaders in which they equal more than the sum of their parts• Knowing the destination where you want to take your business by developing goals that balance what the business can become with what it can realistically achieve• Setting laser-sharp priorities that become the road map for meeting your goals• Dealing creatively and positively with societal pressures that go beyond the economic value creation activities of your businessKnow-How is the missing link of leadership. By showing how the eight know-hows link to, interact with, and reinforce personal and psychological traits, Ram Charan provides a holistic and innovative portrait of successful leaders of the twenty-first century.	2007-01-02	Crown Business						ZZZ000000

The same spell will envelop anyone who reads Silk, a work that has the compression of a fable, the evocative detail of the greatest historical fiction, and the devastating erotic force of a dream.	1998-08-25	Vintage Books						ZZZ000000
9780385513579	Wal-mart,the bully of Bentonville : how the high cost of everyday low prices is hurting America	Anthony Bianco		The largest company in the world by far, Wal-Mart takes in revenues in excess of $280 billion, employs 1.4 million American workers, and controls a large share of the business done by almost every U.S. consumer-product company. More than 138 million shoppers visit one of its 5,300 stores each week. But Wal-Mart’s “everyday low prices” come at a tremendous cost to workers, suppliers, competitors, and consumers.The Bully of Bentonville exposes the zealous, secretive, small-town mentality that rules Wal-Mart and chronicles its far-reaching consequences. In a gripping, richly textured narrative, Anthony Bianco shows how Wal-Mart has driven down retail wages throughout the country, how their substandard pay and meager health-care policy and anti-union mentality have led to a large scales exploitation of workers, why their aggressive expansion inevitably puts locally owned stores out of business, and how their pricing policies have forced suppliers to outsource work and move thousands of jobs overseas. Based on interviews with Wal-Mart employees, managers, executives, competitors, suppliers, customers, and community leaders, The Bully of Bentonville brings the truths about Wal-Mart into sharp focus.	2007-02-20	Currency Doubleday						ZZZ000000

9780517223260	Churchill on Leadership,Executive Success in the Face of Adversity	Steven F. Hayward		Success often depends on the strength of a single quality: leadership. Winston Churchill is universally recognized as one of the 20th century's great political leaders and his words ring just as true in the world of commerce. A wise, witty, and inspiring leader, Churchill ran Great Britain like a great corporation. "Perhaps the finest book on practical leadership ever written." — Brian TracyChurchill on Leadership demonstrates that the principles that guided Churchill ably translate to private industry today. Author Steven F. Hayward gives strong evidence that, if you remove Churchill from his political context, he would have the resume to be among the great business leaders of any age. Churchill: • was a financier (as chancellor of the Exechequer) and labor negotiator (as home secretary)• managed a large transportation network (as head of the British Navy) and far-flung property holdings (as colonial secretary)• persevered through bankruptcies and other financial disasters• conceived and introduced innovative new products over the opposition of his colleagues, and reorganized major production operations in the midst of crisis. With wit and insight, Hayward reveals Churchill's secrets for business success from assembling and inspiring a first-rate team to preparing a wise budget, from communicating a vision to structuring effective meetings, from acting decisively to rebounding from a failure. Laced with epochal events from the historical stage, enlivened with stimulating speculation, and leavened with wit, Churchill on Leadership is both an enjoyable read and a thought-provoking lesson on leadership.From the Trade Paperback edition.	2004-05-04	Random House Value Publishing						ZZZ000000

9781400065080	The second world,empires and influence in the new global order	Parag Khanna		Grand explanations of how to understand the complex twenty-first-century world have all fallen short–until now. In The Second World, the brilliant young scholar Parag Khanna takes readers on a thrilling global tour, one that shows how America’s dominant moment has been suddenly replaced by a geopolitical marketplace wherein the European Union and China compete with the United States to shape world order on their own terms. This contest is hottest and most decisive in the Second World: pivotal regions in Eastern Europe, Central Asia, Latin America, the Middle East, and East Asia. Khanna explores the evolution of geopolitics through the recent histories of such underreported, fascinating, and complicated countries as Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan, Colombia, Libya, Vietnam, and Malaysia–nations whose resources will ultimately determine the fate of the three superpowers, but whose futures are perennially uncertain as they struggle to rise into the first world or avoid falling into the third.Informed, witty, and armed with a traveler’s intuition for blending into diverse cultures, Khanna mixes copious research with deep reportage to remake the map of the world. He depicts second-world societies from the inside out, observing how globalization divides them into winners and losers along political, economic, and cultural lines–and shows how China, Europe, and America use their unique imperial gravities to pull the second-world countries into their orbits. Along the way, Khanna also explains how Arabism and Islamism compete for the Arab soul, reveals how Iran and Saudi Arabia play the superpowers against one another, unmasks Singapore’s inspirational role in East Asia, and psychoanalyzes the second-world leaders whose decisions are reshaping the balance of power. He captures the most elusive formula in international affairs: how to think like a country.In the twenty-first century, globalization is the main battlefield of geopolitics, and America itself runs the risk of descending into the second world if it does not renew itself and redefine its role in the world. Comparable in scope and boldness to Francis Fukuyama’s The End of History and the Last Man and Samuel P. Huntington’s The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order, Parag Khanna’s The Second World will be the definitive guide to world politics for years to come.“A savvy, streetwise primer on dozens of individual countries that adds up to a coherent theory of global politics.”–Robert D. Kaplan, author of Eastward to Tartary and Warrior Politics“A panoramic overview that boldly addresses the dilemmas of the world that our next president will confront.”–Dr. Zbigniew Brzezinski, former national security advisor"Parag Khanna's fascinating book takes us on an epic journey around the multipolar world, elegantly combining historical analysis, political theory, and eye-witness reports to shed light on the battle for primacy between the world's new empires." –Mark Leonard, Executive Director, European Council on Foreign Relations "Khanna, a widely recognized expert on global politics, offers an study of the 21st century's emerging "geopolitical marketplace" dominated by three "first world" superpowers, the U.S., Europe and China... The final pages of his book warn eloquently of the risks of imperial overstretch combined with declining economic dominance and deteriorating quality of life. By themselves those pages are worth the price of a book that from beginning to end inspires reflection."–Publishers Weekly	2008-03-04	Random House						ZZZ000000

Tonight, the White Army advances on the town where the Tsar and his family are being held captive by the Bolsheviks. Nicholas dares to hope for salvation. Instead, the Romanovs are coldly and methodically executed.Moscow: Present Day. Atlanta lawyer Miles Lord, fluent in Russian and well versed in the country’s history, is thrilled to be in Moscow on the eve of such a momentous event. After the fall of Communism and a succession of weak governments, the Russian people have voted to bring back the monarchy. The new tsar will be chosen from the distant relatives of Nicholas II by a specially appointed commission, and Miles’ job is to perform a background check on the Tsarist candidate favored by a powerful group of Western businessmen. But research quickly becomes the least of Miles’ concerns when he is nearly killed by gunmen on a city plaza.Suddenly Miles is racing across continents, shadowed by nefarious henchmen. At first, his only question is why people are pursuing him. But after a strange conversation with a mysterious Russian, who steers Miles toward the writings of Rasputin, he becomes desperate to know more–most important, what really happened to the family of Russia’s last tsar?His only companion is Akilina Petrov, a Russian circus performer sympathetic to his struggle, and his only guide is a cryptic message from Rasputin that implies that the bloody night of so long ago is not the last chapter in the Romanovs’ story . . . and that someone might even have survived the massacre. The prophecy’s implications are earth-shattering–not only for the future of the tsar and mother Russia, but also for Miles himself.Steve Berry, national bestselling author of the phenomenal thriller The Amber Room, once again delves into rich historical fact to produce an explosive page-turner. In The Romanov Prophecy, the authentic and the speculative meld into a fascinating and exceptionally suspenseful work of fiction.From the Hardcover edition.	2005	Ballantine Books						ZZZ000000

9780307275554	The Devil wears Prada	Lauren Weisberger		A delightfully dishy novel about the all-time most impossible boss in the history of impossible bosses. Andrea Sachs, a small-town girl fresh out of college, lands the job “a million girls would die for.” Hired as the assistant to Miranda Priestly, the high-profile, fabulously successful editor of Runway magazine, Andrea finds herself in an office that shouts Prada! Armani! Versace! at every turn, a world populated by impossibly thin, heart-wrenchingly stylish women and beautiful men clad in fine-ribbed turtlenecks and tight leather pants that show off their lifelong dedication to the gym. With breathtaking ease, Miranda can turn each and every one of these hip sophisticates into a scared, whimpering child. THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA gives a rich and hilarious new meaning to complaints about “The Boss from Hell.” Narrated in Andrea’s smart, refreshingly disarming voice, it traces a deep, dark, devilish view of life at the top only hinted at in gossip columns and over Cosmopolitans at the trendiest cocktail parties. From sending the latest, not-yet-in-stores Harry Potter to Miranda’s children in Paris by private jet, to locating an unnamed antique store where Miranda had at some point admired a vintage dresser, to serving lattes to Miranda at precisely the piping hot temperature she prefers, Andrea is sorely tested each and every day—and often late into the night with orders barked over the phone. She puts up with it all by keeping her eyes on the prize: a recommendation from Miranda that will get Andrea a top job at any magazine of her choosing. As things escalate from the merely unacceptable to the downright outrageous, however, Andrea begins to realize that the job a million girls would die for may just kill her. And even if she survives, she has to decide whether or not the job is worth the price of her soul.	2006	Anchor Books						ZZZ000000

9788189632281	STALL POINTS : Most Companies Stop Growing--Yours Doesn't Have To	Matthew S Olson & Derek van Bever		Very few large companies manage to avoid stalls in revenue growth. These stalls are not attributable to the natural business cycle. Rather, careful analysis reveals that the vast majority of such stalls are the direct result of strategic choices made by corporate leaders. In short, stoppages in growth are almost always avoidable. This extensively researched book analyzes the growth experiences of more than six hundred Fortune 100 companies over the past fifty years to identify why growth stalls and to discover how to rectify a stall in progress or, even better, avoid one. Board members and executives in companies of all sizes will find this book a practical and essential resource. Matthew S. Olson and Derek van Bever investigate the incidence and consequences of growth stalls in major corporations, then probe the root causes. Examining hundreds of stall points, the authors conclude that the greatest threat to a companyâ€™s growth is posed by obsolete strategic assumptions that undermine market position, and by breakdowns in innovation and talent management. The study includes a selection of practices for articulating and monitoring strategic assumptions and concludes with a self-test built around fifty â€œRed Flagâ€ warning signs of an impending growth stall.	2008-08-01	RAVE MEDIA						ZZZ000000

9780500513361	The way we live in the city	Stafford Cliff&Gilles de Chabaneix		"Gilles de Chabaneix was fascinated by the life of cities around the world, both as complete entities and as compendiums of urban detail in the forms of streets, houses, apartments, offcies, bars, cáfes and people. Beyond and behind the life of the streets lie the private spaces - interiors and rooms where the tastes and aspirations of individuals are reflected in the design and arrangement of myriad objects set amid a whole panoply of different colours, textures, materials and finishes. This book illustrates the ways in which people go about creating their own personal environment and the detailing they apply to it. ... Every opportunity to make cross-cultural comparisons and connections is taken, providing a truly international view of the city experience, and creating a whole book that is effectively a compilation of inspirational ideas for stylish urban living." - book jacket.	2007-03	Thames & Hudson						ZZZ000000

9780230529014	Gospel According to Judas,By Benjamin Iscariot	Jeffrey Archer&Francis J. Moloney		The Pope recently referred to the continuing 'mystery of Judas'. This intriguing book - the result of an intense collaboration between one of the world's most popular storytellers and one of the world's leading biblical scholars - throws a new light on the events leading up to the great betrayal. This book, presented in gospel style with two-colour text, ribbon marker and gilded edges, and ostensibly written by the son of Judas, is a highly readable and gripping account of the stories of Jesus and Judas, which will open a whole new debate among secular and religious readers.  The project is as bold as it is simple: Archer has written a story for twenty-first-century readers, while Moloney has ensured the result is credible to a first-century Christian or Jew.

9780330418386	Musicophilia,Tales of Music and the Brain	Oliver Sacks		'A humane discourse on the fragility of our minds, of the bodies that give rise to them, and of the world they create for us.' "Daily Telegraph"  Oliver Sacks' compassionate tales of people struggling to adapt to different neurological conditions have fundamentally changed the way we understand our own minds. In "Musicophilia," he examines the powers of music through the individual experiences of patients, musicians and everyday people - those struck by affliction, unusual talent and even, in one case, by lightning - to show not only that music occupies more areas of the brain than language does, but also that it can calm and organize, torment and heal. Always wise and compellingly readable, these stories alter our conception of who we are and how we function, and show us an essential part of what it is to be human.  'Fascinating. Music, as Sacks explains, "can pierce the heart directly." And this is the truth that he so brilliantly focuses upon - that music saves, consoles and nourishes us' "Daily Mail"  'Irresistible, astonishing and moving' "Spectator"  'Deeply warm and sympathetic' "Guardian"	2008-10-03	Picador						ZZZ000000

9780330439831	A History of Modern Britain	Andrew Marr		This engaging volume tells the story of how the great political visions and idealisms of Victorian Britain came to be defeated by a culture of consumerism, celebrity, and self-gratification. It explains how in each decade, political leaders found themselves confounded by the British people, who always turned out to be harder to herd than predicted. Historically Britain has been a country on the edge—first of invasion, then of bankruptcy, then on the vulnerable front line of the Cold War, and later in the forefront of the great opening up of capital and migration. This history follows all the political and economic stories of the modern era as well as with such social trends as comedy, cars, the war against homosexuals, oil-men and punks, Margaret Thatcher’s wonderful good luck, political lies, and the true heroes of British theater.	2008	Pan Books						ZZZ000000

For Tom it was a wonderful summer. Innocent, broke, and slightly awestruck on his arrival in London, he was working as a delivery boy at a Chinese takeaway. Then May, the daughter of the owner, became his love. But suddenly, inexplicably, Tom loses his home, his job, and his beloved. A squat, then a battered green van, become his refuge, his longing for May his one obsession. As Tom travels through the desperate sub cultures of low-life London, he is also caught up in his dreams about China, each more vivid and shocking than the last. China Dreams is dazzling, disturbing, lyrical, and occasionally fearsome—a stunning literary achievement.	2008-01	Macmillan UK						ZZZ000000

The result is an intoxicating as it is wise, amusing as well as stimulating, and presented in so fresh a fashion as to be unique . . . I could not stop, and now much start all over again.' Brian Masters, " Mail on Sunday"  'De Botton not only has a complete understanding of Proust's life . . . but what is particularly charming about this small, readable book is its tongue-in-cheek benignity, its lightly held erudition and its generous way of lending itself to what is not only the greatest book of the century but also the darkest and the most eccentric' Edmund White, " Observer"  'It contains more human interest and play of fancy than most fiction . . . de Botton, in emphasizing Proust's healing, advisory aspects, does us the service of rereading him on our behalf, providing of that vast sacred lake a sweet and lucid distillation.' John Updike, "New Yorker "  'De Botton's little book is so charming, amusing and sensible that it may even itself change your life.' Allan Massie, "Daily Telegraph"  'This engaging book is one of the most entertaining pieces of literary criticism I have read in a long while.'

As shock turns to fury, the village residents form a united front against Patrick's parents and cousin, who report incidents of vicious threats and violence. But friend and neighbour Siobhan Lavenham remains convinced that Patrick has fallen victim to a prejudiced investigation and, putting her own position within the bigoted community in serious jeopardy, stands firmly by his family in defence of the O'Riordan name. Days before the trial, terrible secrets about the O'Riordans' past are revealed to Siobhan, and the family's only supporter is forced to question her loyalties.

9780061562426	Wiser in battle,a soldier's story	Ricardo S. Sanchez&Donald T. Phillips		Amid all of the criticisms of America's war in Iraq, one essential voice has remained silent—until now. In his groundbreaking new memoir, Wiser in Battle, Lieutenant General Ricardo S. Sanchez, former commander of coalition forces in Iraq, reports back from the front lines of the global war on terror to provide a comprehensive and chilling exploration of America's historic military and foreign policy blunder.   With unflinching candor, Sanchez describes the chaos on the Iraqi battlefield caused by the Bush administration's misguided command of the military, as well as his own struggle to set the coalition on the path toward victory. Sanchez illuminates the fallout of the communication breakdown between the leadership on the front and the politicians in Washington, revealing fractious discussions he had with, among others, Ambassador Paul Bremer and Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld.   Drawing on his tenure on the ground, Sanchez shows how minor insurgent attacks grew into synchronized operations that finally ignited into a major insurgency and all-out civil war. He provides an insider's account of the Abu Ghraib prison scandal, explaining the circumstances that led to the abuses, who perpetrated them, and what the formal investigations revealed—all the while reflecting on America's objectionable use of torture and the grave need for the country's leadership to pursue an ethical course of action in the war on terror. Sanchez also details the cynical use of the Iraq War for political gain in Washington and shows how the pressure of an around-the-clock news cycle drove and distorted critical battle decisions, such as troop drawdowns, the fight for Fallujah, and the transfer of sovereignty.   In addition, Sanchez shares the story of his career. He tells of the journey from his poverty-stricken youth on the Texas banks of the Rio Grande to joining the Reserve Officers' Training Corps at sixteen and later serving in Kosovo, Desert Shield and Desert Storm, and, ultimately, Iraq. At the time of his retirement, Sanchez was the highest-ranking Hispanic in the U.S. Army.   The first book written by a former on-site commander in Iraq, Wiser in Battle is essential reading for all who wish to understand the current war and the American military's role in the new century.	2008-05-06	Harpercollins						ZZZ000000
9780061736667	Obama,From Promise to Power	David Mendell		The biography of America's hottest political superstar, Barack Obama—a man poised on the threshold of greatness. Barack Obama's meteoric rise from Hawaii high schooler to exemplary Harvard Law School student to well-groomed politico to history-making presidential candidate is the stuff of legend. Since his headline-grabbing speech at the Democratic National Convention in 2004, Obama has come to represent the promise of unity among groups of all types of Americans—blacks and whites; Democrats, Republicans, and moderates; the young and the old; the upper, middle, and lower classes. Veteran Chicago Tribune journalist David Mendell has covered Obama since the beginning of the candidate's campaign for the Senate. In Obama: From Promise to Power, the author offers a revealing, detailed portrait based on intensive research and exclusive interviews with Obama's closest aides, mentors, political adversaries, and family—most notably his charismatic wife, Michelle. It is an eye-opening look at the evolution of a brilliant politician whose name has become a catchphrase for hope in a politically jaded society.	2008-09-16	HarperCollins						ZZZ000000

9780553814187	Cannabis,a history	Martin Booth		An in-depth study of the most widely-used and controversial drug in the world today. To some it’s anathema, to others it provides relief from crippling pain; to others still, it is a legal anomaly and should be decriminalized.

Its impact on the world’s cultures and economies is undeniable. Dating back to the Neolithic period, the history of cannabis is a tale of medical advance, religious enlightenment, political subterfuge and human rights; of law enforcement and customs officers, cunning smugglers, street pushers, gang warfare, writers, artists, musicians and happy-go-lucky hippies and potheads. The author has used his links to drug law-enforcement agencies throughout the world in this impeccably researched social and cultural history of the most popular and controversial drug in the world.	2004-07-30	Bantam						ZZZ000000

His sudden disappearance aroused conjecture all over the world. He eventually surfaced in Africa where, with a hundred Cuban guerrilla fighters to assist him, he put into action his revolutionary theories of how to help the oppressed people of Africa throw off the yoke of colonial imperialism. The African Dream consists of the hitherto unpublished diaries that Guevara kept while he was in Africa. The diaries record the first steps in the catastrophic, if heroic, adventure that was to lead ultimately to his death in the Bolivian jungle and to the creation of one of the most potent romantic legends of our time. They also offer a unique insight into a man who was one of the most compelling and charismatic figures in 20th century politics.	2001-04-01	Harvill						ZZZ000000

It brings together two cities that barely know each other - the hedonistic Mughal capital, in which the brilliant emperor wrestles daily with questions of belief, desire and the treachery of sons, and the equally sensual Florentine world of powerful courtesans, humanist philosophy and inhuman torture, where Argalia's boyhood friend 'il Machia' - Niccolņ Machiavelli - is learning, the hard way, about the true brutality of power. These two worlds, so far apart, turn out to be uncannily alike, and the enchantments of women hold sway over them both.	2009-01	Vintage						ZZZ000000

That world is long dead, and customers now occupy that position. In this relentlessly globalizing economy, we live in a world of oversupply and underdemand, with too many suppliers chasing too few customers, offering more goods and services than the market can absorb.Noel Capon set out to discover what differentiates people who know how to succeed in this changed world-people who are able to create customers for the products and services of their business.The Marketing Mavens is based on a four-year-long research program that spanned twenty-five industries, identifying long-term winners and what they do differently. Put simply, Marketing Mavens place customers at the center of their business and make marketing everyone’s job. Using a wide variety of intriguing, in-depth examples, from ESPN to the Mayo Clinic, Dr. Capon shows how the mavens create customers. How by placing the sports fan at the center of its business, ESPN creates programming that meets the needs of fans that were never given a second thought by the networks; or how physicians at the Mayo Clinic, being both technical experts and skilled at creating a patient-centric ambience, motivate people to pay the extra travel and lodging expenses not covered by insurance.Marketing Mavens, though a rare breed, can be found up and down an organization-from the CEO to chief marketing officers to business unit managers. Noel Capon has talked to mavens from across the global economy and brings forth their uncanny insights behind the five imperatives of the true Marketing Maven:¥ Picking markets that matter¥ Selecting segments to dominate and finding the sweet spot in that segment¥ Designing the offer to create customer value and secure differential advantage¥ Integrating to serve the customer ¥ And measuring what mattersNoel Capon in The Marketing Mavens redefines marketing, moving it from a focus on selling and communication into a discipline that guides all the key decisions of a business. By seeing marketing as everyone’s business-not the domain of a few specialists-you’ll get your business in step with the way the world really works . . . and start creating customers. Next year’s profits don’t depend on next year’s numbers but on next year’s customers. The Marketing Mavens points the way to those customers, profits, and an increased stock price.	2007	Crown Business						ZZZ000000

9780609610657	Why pride matters more than money,the power of the world's greatest motivational force	Jon R. Katzenbach		The book that turns our understanding of motivation on its head . . . and shows why most companies get it wrong.There are few people with more experience and accumulated wisdom about the inner workings of business and how people can work together more effectively than Jon Katzenbach. His groundbreaking research has resulted in several important books, including The Wisdom of Teams and Real Change Leaders. Over the past several years he has turned his attention to one of the perennial questions of leaders everywhere: How do I motivate my employees? Most everyone frets about how to devise schemes that will keep the troops revved up. Conventional wisdom—or at least the practice at most companies—often centers on money as the primary motivating force. Many also rely on intimidation, which like money generally has a short-term impact. But what Katzenbach has found in his research at many organizations is that both of these practices do little to build the long-term sustainability of an organization. For that you need a powerful force that has been—until this point—understood by few managers and implemented by fewer still: pride.From the front lines to the executive suite, most people are motivated by feelings of accomplishment, approval, and camaraderie. It’s why the best employees strive well beyond performance levels that will yield them higher pay and why most true professionals relentlessly avoid retirement. Why does Southwest Airlines consistently turn in the highest levels of performance and profitability of any company in the airline business? What can the U.S. Marines teach us about individual commitment that can be used in the for-profit world? How is General Motors overcoming its history of labor-management enmity through the efforts of “pride-builders” from both the union and the management side? By drawing on what he has learned from these and many other organizations, Jon Katzenbach provides a practical program for understanding the role of pride:• Money is not the motivator most people think it is: Katzenbach shows why pay-for-performance programs by themselves result in employees who focus on self-serving behavior and skin-deep organizational commitment. • Money tends to be a short-term motivational device and works best during times of growth, but pride works in bad times as well as good.• Cultivating pride is an investment that yields high returns on workforce performance over time and is not nearly as costly as relying solely on monetary compensation and the turnover risks that accompany a “show me the money” culture. Katzenbach shares unique insights and specifics about how the best mid-level pride-builders take advantage of the world’s greatest motivational force even in environments as challenging as General Motors and Aetna. He shows how managers at every level are missing a powerful lever if they are not instilling pride as a primary force for building their organization.

9781400082469	Dreaming in Code,Two Dozen Programmers, Three Years, 4,732 Bugs, and One Quest for Transcendent Software	Scott Rosenberg		CHAPTER 1DOOMED[JULY 2003]Michael Toy places his palms on his cheeks, digs his chin into his wrists, squints into his PowerBook, and begins the litany."John is doomed. He has five hundred hours of work scheduled between now and the next release. . . . Katie's doomed. She has way more hours than there are in the universe. Brian is majorly doomed. Plus he's only half time. Andy--Andy is the only one who doesn't look doomed. There are no hundreds on his list."They don't look doomed, these programmers sitting around a nondescript conference room table in Belmont, California, on a summer day. They listen quietly to their manager. Toy is a tall man with an impressive gut and a ponytail, but he seems to shrink into a space of dejection as he details how far behind schedule the programmers have fallen. It's July 17, 2003, and he's beginning to feel doomed himself about getting everything done in the less than two months before they are supposed to finish another working version of their project."Everybody who has a list with more time than there is in the universe needs to sit down with me and go over it."These lists are the bug lists--rosters of unsolved or "open" problems or flaws. Together they provide a full accounting of everything these software developers know must be fixed in their product. The bug lists live inside a program called Bugzilla. Toy's programmers are also using Bugzilla to track all the programming tasks that must be finished in order to complete a release of the project; each one is responsible for entering his or her list into Bugzilla along with an estimate of how long each task will take to complete."Now let's talk about why we're behind. Does anyone have a story to tell?"There's silence for a minute. John Anderson, a lanky programming veteran whose title is systems architect and who is, in a de facto sort of way, the project's lead coder, finally speaks up, in a soft voice. "There's a bunch of reasons. In order to build something, you have to have a blueprint. And we don't always have one. Then you hit unexpected problems. It's hard to know how long something's going to take until you know for sure you can build it.""But you can't just throw up your hands and say, I quit." Toy usually prefers to check things off his agenda fast, running his developers' meetings with a brisk attitude of "let's get out of here as fast as we can" that's popular among programmers. But today he's persistent. He won't let the scheduling problems drop. "We need to make guesses and then figure out what went wrong with our guesses."Jed Burgess, one of the project's younger programmers, speaks up. "There's a compounding of uncertainty: Your estimates are based on someone else's estimates."Toy begins reviewing Anderson's bugs. "The famous flicker-free window resizing problem. What's up with that?"Officially, this was bug number 44 in Bugzilla, originally entered on January 19, 2003, and labeled "Flicker Free window display when resizing windows." I had first heard of the flicker-free window resizing problem at a meeting in February 2003 when the Open Source Applications Foundation (OSAF), whose programmers Toy was managing, had completed the very earliest version of its project, Chandler--an internal release not for public unveiling that came even before the 0.1 edition. Ultimately, Chandler was supposed to grow up into a powerful "personal information manager" (PIM) for organizing and sharing calendars, email, to-do lists, and all the other stray information in our lives. Right now, the program remained barely embryonic.At that February meeting, Anderson had briefly mentioned the flicker bug--when you changed the size of a window on the Chandler screen, everything flashed for a second--as a minor matter, something he wanted to investigate and resolve because, though it did not stop the program from working, it offended him aesthetically. Now, nearly six months later, he still hasn't fixed it.Today Anderson explains that the problem is thornier than he had realized. It isn't simply a matter of fixing code that he or his colleagues have written; its roots lie in a body of software called wxWidgets that the Chandler team has adopted as one of the building blocks of their project. Anderson must either wait for the programmers who run wxWidgets to fix their own code or find a way to work around their flaw."So you originally estimated that this would take four hours of work," Toy says. "That seems to have been off by an order of magnitude.""It's like a treasure hunt," Anderson, unflappable, responds. "You have to find the first thing. You have to get the first clue before you're on your way, and you don't know how long it will take.""So you originally estimated four hours on this bug. You now have eight hours.""Sometimes," Anderson offers philosophically, "you just wake up in the morning, an idea pops into your head, and it's done--like that."Mitchell Kapor has been sitting quietly during the exchange. Kapor is the founder and funder of the Open Source Applications Foundation, and Chandler is his baby. Now he looks up from his black Thinkpad. "Would it be useful to identify issues that have this treasure-hunt aspect? Is there a certain class of task that has this uncertainty?""Within the first hour of working on the bug," Burgess volunteers, "you know which it's going to be."So it is agreed: Bugs that have a black hole-like quality--bugs that you couldn't even begin to say for sure how long they would take to fix--would be tagged in Bugzilla with a special warning label.Shortly after the meeting, Toy sits down at his desk, calls up the Bugzilla screen, and enters a new keyword for bug number 44, "Flicker Free window display when resizing windows": scary.Toy's fatalistic language wasn't just a quirk of personality: Gallows humor is a part of programming culture, and he picked up his particular vocabulary during his time at Netscape. Though today Netscape is remembered as the Web browser company whose software and stock touched off the Internet boom, its developers had always viewed themselves as a legion of the doomed, cursed with impossible deadlines and destined to fail.There was, in truth, nothing especially doomed about OSAF's programmers: Several of them had just returned from a conference where they presented their work to an enthusiastic crowd of their peers--who told them that their vision could be "crisper" but who mostly looked at the blueprint for Chandler and said, "I want it now!" Though the software industry had been slumping for three straight years, they were working for a nonprofit organization funded by $5 million from Kapor. Their project was ambitious, but their ranks included veteran programmers with estimable achievements under their belts. Andy Hertzfeld had written central chunks of the original Macintosh operating system. John Anderson had written one of the first word processors for the Macintosh and later managed the software team at Steve Jobs's Next. Lou Montulli, another Chandler programmer who was not at the meeting, had written key parts of the Netscape browser. They'd all looked doom in the eye before.Similarly, there was nothing especially scary about bug number 44. It was a routine sort of problem that programmers had accepted responsibility for ever since computer software had migrated from a text-only, one-line-at-a-time universe to today's graphic windows-and-mouse landscape. What scared Toy was not so much the nature of Bug 44 but the impossibility of knowing how long it would take to fix. Take one such unknown, place it next to all the other similar unknowns in Chandler, multiply them by one another, and you have the development manager's nightmare: a "black hole" in the schedule, a time chasm of indeterminate and perhaps unknowable dimensions.Two months before, the entire Chandler team of a dozen programmers had met for a week of back-to-back meetings to try to solve a set of problems that they had dubbed "snakes"--another word Toy had salvaged from Netscape's ruins. A snake wasn't simply a difficult problem; it was an "important problem that we don't have consensus on how to attack." Snake superseded a looser usage at OSAF of the word dragon to describe the same phenomenon.Black holes, snakes, dragons--the metaphors all daubed a layer of mythopoetic heroism over the most mundane of issues: how to schedule multiple programmers so that work actually got done. You could plug numbers into Bugzilla all day long; you could hold one meeting after another about improving the process. Software time remained a snake, and it seemed invincible.This was hardly news to anyone in the room at OSAF. The peculiar resistance of software projects to routine scheduling is both notorious and widely accepted. In the software development world, lateness was so common that a new euphemism had to be invented for it: slippage.Certainly, every field has its sagas of delay; the snail's pace of lawsuits is legendary, and any building contractor who actually finishes a job on time is met with stares of disbelief. But there's something stranger and more baffling about the way software time bends and twists back on itself like a Mobius strip. Progress seems to move in great spasms and then halt for no reason. You think you're almost done, and then you turn around and six months have passed with no measurable progress.This is what it feels like: A wire is loose somewhere deep inside the workings. When it's connected, work moves quickly. When it's not, work halts. Everyone on the inside tries painstakingly to figure out which wire is loose, where the outage is, while observers on the outside try to offer helpful suggestions and then, losing their patience, give the whole thing a sharp kick.Every software project in history has had its loose wires. Every effort to improve the making of software is an effort to keep them tight.The earliest and best diagnosis of the problem of software time can be found in a 1975 book by Frederick Brooks, The Mythical Man-Month. Brooks was a veteran IBM programming manager who had seen firsthand the follies of the largest software project of its day, the creation of the operating system for the IBM System/360. That huge, expensive mainframe computer would become the mainstay of big business for the next two decades, but its gestation and birth were plagued with delays and cost overruns. It had become, as Brooks put it, a "tar pit," a sticky trap for corporate beasts, even ones as "great and powerful" as IBM. Brooks's group at IBM, confounded by how far behind they'd fallen, flung waves of new programmers at the job, like General Lee's ordering one brigade after another to charge up Cemetery Ridge--only to find that the reinforcements, far from getting the project over its hump, actually made things worse.And so he formulated Brooks's Law, which is both a principle and a paradox: "Adding manpower to a late software project makes it later."The soundness of Brooks's Law has been borne out over and over in the three decades since its formulation. But it is so deeply counterintuitive that it still regularly flummoxes programmers and managers, who often would rather pretend that it does not apply to them than deal with its disturbing implications.Brooks noted that software developers are typically optimists who assume that each bug can be fixed quickly and that the number of new bugs will diminish until the last one has been licked. This optimism, along with the programmers' desire to please the impatient patrons who have commissioned them to create something new, skews the schedule from the start. In practice, Brooks found, nearly all software projects require only one-sixth of their time for the writing of code and fully half their schedule for testing and fixing bugs. But it was a rare project manager who actually planned to allocate developers' time according to such a breakdown.Next, Brooks argued, the "very unit of effort used in estimating and scheduling" was "a dangerous and deceptive myth." The "man-month" was a concept of scientific management that assumed productivity could be broken down into discrete, identical, fungible units. So if one hundred men (in those days the gender assumption simply came with the territory) could produce fifty widgets in one month, then a single widget required two man-months--and you ought to be able to produce the same number of widgets sooner by throwing more workers at the project. Want your fifty widgets in three days instead of thirty? Just throw one thousand workers at the job instead of one hundred.Brooks observed that "men and months are interchangeable commodities only when a task can be partitioned among many workers with no communication among them." With software, where every project is different and the tools are in constant flux, each time you add a new member to a team, the veterans must drop what they are doing to bring the latecomer up to speed, and everyone needs to pause to reapportion their tasks to give the newcomer something to do. Before you know it, you're even further behind schedule. In the worst cases, Brooks saw, this set up a disastrous loop of delay, a "regenerative scheduling disaster" in which each resetting of the schedule triggers the hiring of more bodies, forcing yet another new schedule into place. Brooks quailed at that prospect: "Therein lies madness."In any case, Brooks found that much of the work in creating software also suffers from "sequential constraints" that limit how far you can go in splitting up tasks: One task must be completed before the next can be tackled, regardless of how many hands work on it. "The bearing of a child takes nine months," he wrote, "no matter how many women are assigned."Finally, the extreme variations in productivity from programmer to programmer--a great programmer was typically able to produce ten times as much work in a given amount of time as a mediocre one, and the work was typically five times as good (measured in terms of speed and efficiency)--sealed Brooks's case against the man-month. If one man's work was so drastically different from another's, that yardstick was useless.Brooks's Law implies that the ideal size for a programming team is one--a single developer who never has to stop to communicate with a colleague. This approach streamlines everything, and it also provides insurance that the project will retain what Brooks calls "conceptual integrity": the alignment of all its parts toward the same purpose and according to a harmonious plan. Indeed, the history of software is full of breakthroughs made by lone wolves. But too much software has simply grown too huge for one person to produce--from the elaborateness of the graphic interface that make programs easier to use to the complexity of the data structures required to reliably and usefully store the huge volumes of information we trust our computers with.From the Hardcover edition.	2007	Crown Publishing Group						ZZZ000000
9780307269706	Zen and Now,On the Trail of Robert Pirsig and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance	Mark Richardson		Zen and Now is a vivid chronicle of a journalist’s heartfelt and determined journey to reconnect with a beloved American classic.In 1968, Robert Pirsig and his eleven-year-old son, Chris, made the cross-country motorcycle trip that would become the inspiration for Pirsig’s book Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, a powerful blend of personal narrative and philosophical investigation that has inspired generations.Among the millions of readers to fall under the book’s spell was Mark Richardson, who as a young man struggled to understand Pirsig’s provocative and elusive ideas. Rereading the book decades later, Richardson, now a journalist and a father of two, was moved by its portrayal of Pirsig’s complex relationship with Chris and struck by the timelessness of its lessons. So he tuned up his old Suzuki dirt bike and became a “Pirsig pilgrim,” one of the legion of fans who retrace the Pirsigs’ route from Minneapolis to San Francisco. In following this itinerary over the lonely byways of the American West, Richardson revisits the people and places from Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, pondering the meaning of Pirsig’s philosophy and the answers it may offer to the questions in his own life. Richardson’s dogged reporting also gives new insight into the reclusive writer’s life, exploring Pirsig’s struggle with mental illness, his unwanted celebrity, and the tragic, brutal murder of Chris in 1979.Published to coincide with the fortieth anniversary of Pirsig’s original trip, Zen and Now is a stirring meditation on a classic work and a passionate inquiry into the lessons it continues to teach us in the complex and bewildering world we inhabit today.	2008-09-09	Alfred A.

9780307352187	The Breakthrough Company,How Everyday Companies Become Extraordinary Performers	Keith R. McFarland		The vast majority of small businesses stay small—and not by choice. Only the most savvy and persistent—a tiny one tenth of one percent—break through to annual sales above $250 million. In The Breakthrough Company, Keith McFarland pinpoints how everyday companies become extraordinary, showing that luck is a negligible factor. Rather, breakthrough success turns out to be associated with a clearly identifiable set of strategies and skills that anyone in any business can emulate—from small startup to industry leader.Encouraged by experts such as business legend Peter Drucker and Good to Great author Jim Collins to identify the drivers that enable a company to push past the entrepreneurial phase, McFarland spent five years building and analyzing the world’s largest growth-company performance database and interviewing more than 1,500 growth-company executives on four continents. His goal was simple: to identify the secrets of breakthrough.The Breakthrough Company is the result. Winnowing a study pool of more than 7,000 companies down to nine that have made the transition to major-player status, McFarland highlights real-world tools and myth-busting insights that can be used by anyone wanting his or her business to join this exclusive circle. Among the book’s takeaways:• Common wisdom holds that the founders and core entrepreneurial leaders of a company must step aside for the business to reach the next level. Not true—as long as founders “crown the company” instead of themselves.• It’s not reckless to make ever-escalating bets on your company’s future, even going nose to nose with competitors many times your size. In fact, it turns out that the only safety comes in constantly upping the ante in exactly this way.• A Business Bermuda Triangle does exist, gobbling up companies on the verge of breakthrough. Presented here are three ways to navigate this potentially deadly hazard successfully.• However good you are—or think you are—you can’t do it alone. Learn how to surround your company with networks of outside resources, aka “scaffolding,” and how to enlist the aid of “insultants”—people who are willing to question a firm’s existing assumptions and ways of doing business.With powerful and specific action steps concluding each chapter—and invaluable advice on virtually every page from business leaders who’ve taken their companies to extraordinary levels of growth and profitability—The Breakthrough Company is one of the most provocative, inspiring, and instructive business books you’ll ever read.	2008-01-15	Crown Business						ZZZ000000

9781590305577	Lovingkindness,The Revolutionary Art of Happiness	Sharon Salzberg&Jon Kabat-Zinn		Throughout our lives we long to love ourselves more deeply and find a greater sense of connection with others. Our fear of intimacy—both with others and with ourselves—creates feelings of pain and longing. But these feelings can also awaken in us the desire for freedom and the willingness to take up the spiritual path. In this inspiring book, Sharon Salzberg, one of America's leading spiritual teachers, shows us how the Buddhist path of lovingkindness can help us discover the radiant, joyful heart within each of us. This practice of lovingkindness is revolutionary because it has the power to radically change our lives, helping us cultivate true happiness in ourselves and genuine compassion for others. The Buddha described the nature of such a spiritual path as "the liberation of the heart, which is love." The author draws on simple Buddhist teachings, wisdom stories from various traditions, guided meditation practices, and her own experience from twenty-five years of practice and teaching to illustrate how each one of us can cultivate love, compassion, joy, and equanimity—the four "heavenly abodes" of traditional Buddhism.	2008-04-08	Shambhala Publications						ZZZ000000

As they grow more confident in their writing skills, friendships develop, and gradually they come to realize that a little openness isn't necessarily a bad thing.	2003-10-09	Orion						ZZZ000000

9780753821794	Salmon fishing in the Yemen	Paul Torday		"Dr. Alfred Jones has many reasons to be content with his life. His latest paper 'Effects of Increased Water Acidity on the Caddis Fly Larva' looks set to cause a stir on the pages of Trout & Salmon, his job as a fisheries scientist is satisfactory, and he and his wife, Mary, have just celebrated their twentieth wedding anniversary - for which she gave him a replacement electric toothbrush. So why does he feel as though something is missing?" "When he is asked to become involved in a project to create a salmon river in the highlands of the Yemen, Fred rejects the idea as absurd. But the proposal catches the eye of several senior British politicians, who feel it might distract the media's attention from the less welcome stories coming out of the Middle East. It's not long before the wheels of government start spinning, and the publicity-savvy PM is talking about the project on television. Fred finds himself forced to set aside his research and instead figure out how to fly ten thousand salmon to a desert country ... and persuade them to swim there." "The project is the brainchild of a Yemeni sheikh: a devout and wealthy man, whose love of salmon fishing and whose fervent, unwavering conviction that the impossible can be made possible, eventually, and astonishingly, inspires Fred, overpowering all his rational objections - and infuriating his wife." "When Fred meets Harriet Chetwode-Talbot, the sheikh's elegant and beautiful land agent, the cracks that have begun to form in his carefully managed existence grow even wider, and as they both embark on an extraordinary journey of faith - and fishing - the diffident Dr. Jones will discover a sense of belief, and a capacity for love, and for heroism, that surprises himself, and all who know him."--BOOK JACKET.	2007-08-30	Phoenix						FIC000000

Coleen has been a stay-at-home mum and a working mum, steered her children through toddler tantrums and sibling rivalry, helped with their homework and cheered them on at football, handled their heartbreak at her divorce and the transition to living with a stepfather.

9780306814020	The E-bomb,how America's new directed energy weapons will change the way future wars will be fought	Doug Beason		In science fiction, futuristic soldiers are often shown wielding light emitting weapons-Flash Gordon used a ray gun, Captain Kirk carried a phaser, and Darth Vader brandished a light saber. But, today, the imagined future of science fiction is soon to be a reality. After more than two decades of research, the United States is on the verge of deploying a new generation of weapons that discharge light-wave energy, the same spectrum of energy found in your microwave, or in your TV remote control. They're called "directed-energy weapons"-lasers, high-powered microwaves, and particle beams-and they signal a revolution in weaponry, perhaps, more profound than the atomic bomb. The first directed-energy (DE) weapons are being tested right now, and their deployment is planned in the very near future. In The E-Bomb, author J. Douglas Beason, Ph.D. and a leading U.S. expert in directed-energy research, will explain in clear and non technical prose these exotic new weapons and answer the questions that all Americans will ask: What is Directed Energy? How do DE weapons work? What can these DE weapons do? And are these weapons safe to use? As the once-imagined weapons of the future begin to appear on today's battlefields, the timely publication of The E-Bomb will help explain how and why the future is now.	2005	Da Capo Press						ZZZ000000

Other Brits had taken Manhattan--Alistair Cooke, Tina Brown, Anna Wintour--so why couldn't he?But things didn't quite go according to plan. Within the space of two years he was fired from Vanity Fair, banned from the most fashionable bar in the city, and couldn't get a date for love or money. Even the local AA group wanted nothing to do with him.How to Lose Friends and Alienate People is Toby Young's hilarious and best-selling account of the five years he spent looking for love in all the wrong places and steadily working his way down the New York food chain, from glossy magazine editor to crash-test dummy for interactive sex toys. A seditious attack on the culture of celebrity from inside the belly of the beast, How to Lose Friends and Alienate People is also a "nastily funny read." --USA Today	2003-06-04	Da Capo Press						ZZZ000000
9780465003006	Reinventing the sacred,a new view of science, reason and religion	Stuart A. Kauffman		Consider the woven integrated complexity of a living cell after 3.8 billion years of evolution. Is it more awe-inspiring to suppose that a transcendent God fashioned the cell, or to consider that the living organism was created by the evolving biosphere? As the eminent complexity theorist Stuart Kauffman explains in this ambitious and groundbreaking new book, people who do not believe in God have largely lost their sense of the sacred and the deep human legitimacy of our inherited spirituality. For those who believe in a Creator God, no science will ever disprove that belief. In Reinventing the Sacred, Kauffman argues that the science of complexity provides a way to move beyond reductionist science to something new: a unified culture where we see God in the creativity of the universe, biosphere, and humanity. Kauffman explains that the ceaseless natural creativity of the world can be a profound source of meaning, wonder, and further grounding of our place in the universe. His theory carries with it a new ethic for an emerging civilization and a reinterpretation of the divine. He asserts that we are impelled by the imperative of life itself to live with faith and courage-and the fact that we do so is indeed sublime. Reinventing the Sacred will change the way we all think about the evolution of humanity, the universe, faith, and reason.	2008-05-05	Basic Books						ZZZ000000
9780871139566	Clausewitz's On war,a biography	Hew Strachan		Perhaps the most important book on military strategy ever written, Carl von Clausewitz’s On War has influenced generations of generals and politicians, has been blamed for the unprecedented death tolls in the First and Second World Wars, and is required reading at military academies to this day. But On War, which was never finished and was published posthumously, is obscure and fundamentally contradictory. What Clausewitz declares in book 1, he discounts in book 8. The language is confusing and the relevance not always clear. For a book that has truly changed the world, On War is extremely difficult for the general reader to approach, to reconcile with itself, and to place in context. Hew Strachan, one of the world’s foremost military historians answers these problems in this fascinating book. He explains how and why On War was written, elucidates what Clausewitz meant, and offers insight into the impact it made on conflict and its continued significance in our world today. This is a must read for fans of military history.	2007	Atlantic Monthly Press						ZZZ000000
9780871139535	Darwin's Origin of species,a biography	Janet Browne		Charles Darwin’s foremost biographer, Janet Browne, delivers a vivid and accessible introduction to the book that permanently altered our understanding of what it is to be human.  A sensation on its publication in 1859, The Origin of the Species profoundly shocked Victorian readers by calling into question the belief in a Creator with its description of evolution through natural selection.  And Darwin’s seminal work is nearly as controversial today.  In her illuminating study, Browne delves into the long genesis of Darwin’s theories, from his readings as a university student and his five-year voyage on the Beagle, to his debates with contemporaries and experiments in his garden.  She explores the shock to Darwin when he read of competing scientist’s similar discoveries and the wide and immediate impact of Darwin’s theories on the world. As one of the launch titles in Atlantic Monthly Press’ “Books That Changed the World” series, Browne’s history takes readers inside The Origin of the Species and shows why it can fairly claim to be the greatest science book ever published.	2007-03-12	Atlantic Monthly Press						ZZZ000000
9780871139573	Plato's Republic,a biography	Simon Blackburn		Plato is perhaps the most significant philosopher who has ever lived and The Republic, composed in Athens in about 375 BC, is widely regarded as his most famous dialogue. Its discussion of the perfect city  —  and the perfect mind  — laid the foundations for Western culture and, for over two thousand years, has been the cornerstone of Western philosophy. As the distinguished Cambridge professor Simon Blackburn points out, it has probably sustained more commentary, and been subject to more radical and impassioned disagreement, than almost any other of the great founding texts of the modern world. In Plato’s Republic, Blackburn explains the judicial, moral and political ideas in the Republic with dazzling insight and clarity. Blackburn also examines Republic’s remarkable influence and unquestioned staying power, and shows why, from St. Augustine to twentieth century philosophers such as Ludwig Wittgenstein and Henri Bergson, Western thought is still conditioned by this most important, and contemporary, of books.	2007-06	Atlantic Monthly Press						ZZZ000000
9781560258452	An eye at the top of the world,the terrifying legacy of the Cold War's most daring CIA operation	Pete Takeda		At some point during the inhumanly cold Himalayan winter straddling 1965 and 1966, a peculiar collection of box-shaped objects — one sprouting a six-foot, insect-like antenna — plummets nine thousand feet down the sheer flanks of a remote peak. Ripped from its moorings by an avalanche, the jumbled apparatus slides down a funnel-shaped hourglass of hard snow and shoots over a black cliff band, careening a vertical distance six times the height of the Empire State building. The boxes come to rest on the glacier at the mountain's base. One, an olive-drab casing the size of a personal computer, begins to sink. Then, trailing a robotic dogtail of torn wires, it slowly burns through the snow, melting into solid blue glacial ice, eventually disappearing beneath the surface, and never seen again. No one actually witnessed this event. But as you read these words, nearly four pounds of plutonium — locked in the glacier's dark unknowable heart — are almost certainly moving ever closer to the source of the Ganges River. Eye at the Top of the World, provides a harrowing present-day account of Takeda's expedition to solve the mystery of Nanda Devi.	2006-09-28	Thunder's Mouth Press						ZZZ000000

Beginning with ancient civilizations, he explores how the zero came into being, its rocky reception in Europe, and the early avoidance and eventual acceptance of the void by Christianity. Investigating the concept of nothing through the work of writers from the ancient Greeks to the present, he examines mathematics, cosmology, theology and physics to reveal the nothing that is at the heart of most things. Finally, Barrow spotlights recent exciting discoveries in astronomy about the nature of the vacuum which are dramatically affecting scientific explanations of the universe.	2001-05-07	Vintage						ZZZ000000

9780099498544	21 - Bringing Down the House,How Six Students Took Vegas for Millions	Ben Mezrich		Real-life all too rarely offers stories that are quite as satisfying as fiction. TWENTY-ONE is one of the exceptions. Cheating in casinos is illegal; card-counting - making a record of what cards have so far been dealt to enable the player to make some prediction of what cards remain in the deck - is not. But casinos understandably dislike the practice and make every effort to keep card-counters out of their premises. TWENTY-ONE tells the true story of the most successful scam ever, in which teams of brilliant young mathematicians and physicists won millions of dollars from the casinos of Las Vegas, being drawn in the process into the high-life of drugs, high-spending and sex. TWENTY-ONE is as readable and as fascinating as Liar's Poker or Barbarians At the Gate, an insight into a closed, excessive and utterly corrupt world.	2008-12-18	Arrow						ZZZ000000
9780224085236	Nothing to be frightened of	Julian Barnes		I dont believe in God, but I miss Him. Julian Barnes new book is, among many things, a family memoir, an exchange with his brother (a philosopher), a meditation on mortality and the fear of death, a celebration of art, an argument with and about God, and a homage to the French writer Jules Renard. Though he warns us that this is not my autobiography, the result is like a tour of the mind of one of our most brilliant writers. When Angela Carter reviewed Barnes first novel, Metroland, she praised the mature way he wrote about death. Now, nearly thirty years later, he returns to the subject in a wise , funny and constantly surprising book, which defies category and classification except as Barnesian.	2008	Jonathan Cape						ZZZ000000

If we trust in our abilities they will repay us.With a raconteurs engaging charm, Garry Kasparov takes us inside a brilliant strategic mind. As Sun-Tzu distilled the secrets of the art of war and Machiavelli unveiled the lessons to be learned from courtly intrigue, Kasparov a player whose record is likely never to be rivalled reveals how and why the game of chess is a fitting and powerful teacher of how to be prepared for, and how to win in, even the most competitive situations.I used to attack because it was the only thing I knew.

In IThe Real Toy Story/I, investigative journalist Eric Clark exposes the startling truths behind Britain's favourite toys. Drawing on interviews with over 200 industry insiders, Clark names and shames the corporations spending millions on research into the best way to manipulate their target audience while manufacturing products in China under virtual slave labour conditions. In a world of cut-throat competition and cold-blooded marketing, toy companies are increasingly willing to sacrifice our children in the rush for profits. And as more children forsake cuddly play things for Ipods and cell phones, companies are using even more extreme tactics- unashamedly using sex and violence to sell dolls and action men to children as young as three - to make sure that their toy is Ithe/I one that children want to have. IThe Real Toy Story/I is essential reading for the millions of adults who care about the toys they choose for the children in their lives.	2007-04-02	Black Swan						ZZZ000000

But it could also be that you're the wrong blood type for the kinds of foods the diet recommends. Peter D'Adamo makes a persuasive argument that your blood type is an evolutionary marker that tells you which foods you'll process best, and which will be useless calories. He covers the entire range for each of the four blood types, from entrčes to condiments and seasonings, and also makes type-specific exercise and lifestyle recommendations.	1998	Century						ZZZ000000

9780091923815	The Selfish Capitalist,Origins of Affluenza	Oliver James		In the bestsellingAffluenza, world-renowned psychologist Oliver James introduced us to a modern-day virus sweeping through the English-speaking world — how our obsessive, envious tendencies make us twice as prone to depression, anxiety and addictions as people in other developed nations. NowThe Selfish Capitalistprovides more detailed substantiation for the claims made inAffluenza, and outlines the political, economic and social climate in which the virus has grown. A modern-day The State We’re In, the book’s argument will chime with a public deeply disenchanted with all the main political parties. James points out that, since the Seventies, the rich have become much, much richer, yet the average person’s wage has not increased at all. He provides a wealth of evidence to show that we have become more miserable and distressed during this time, and suggests that this is a direct consequence of Thatcherite/Blairite “Selfish Capitalism,” whose most significant act has been to rob the poor to give to the rich. The Selfish Capitalistis a rallying cry to reduce levels of distress by adopting a form of unselfish capitalism. It is a hard-hitting and thought-provoking work that tells us why our personal well-being must take precedence over the wealth of a tiny minority if we are to cure ourselves of this disease.	2008-09-16	Vermilion						ZZZ000000
9780091930936	Conspirator	Helen Rappaport		Conspirator is the compelling story of Lenin in exile. It tells how, for seventeen years, he lived a hand-to-mouth existence outside Russia, working towards the upheaval that in 1917 transformed the political landscape of Europe: the Russian Revolution. Constantly watched by the secret police, the arch conspirator and his cohorts were dependent on the protection of a shadowy network of like-minded friends and supporters. Obsessive, penniless and driven, they took huge risks to publish and smuggle back into Russia the samizdat literature that spread their message. Lenin was always on the move, between the great cities of Europe - Paris, London, Geneva, Brussels and Munich - and the rural backwaters of Finland and Poland. He led an uncertain life, often under assumed names, fleeing lodgings at a monent's notice and frequently short of food. Helen Rappaport's lively account describes Lenin s triumphs and the conflicts, personal and political, with those who shared his exile. She builds up a vivid picture of Russian émigré life and of how Lenin and the Bolsheviks worked to achieve his vision of a Soviet social democracy. She also explores the toll that their extraordinary existence took not just on Lenin but on the loyal group that surrounded him, and particularly on the women in his life: his long-suffering wife, Nadezhda Krupskaya, his mother-in-law, and his mistress, Inessa Armand, as well as his mother and sisters back home. This is a book alive with fascinating detail, from Lenin's 1908 visit to the celebrated writer Maxim Gorky in Capri for a restorative holiday, to his trips to the working-men's music halls of Montmartre in Belle Epoque Paris, and the story of the London detective who kept Lenin under surveillance, hiding in a cupboard in a room above a pub in Islington as the fledgling party congress fomented revolution. With much new material from rare and previously overlooked sources, Conspirator puts Lenin s pre-revolutionary struggle for change in Russia into the wider context of the international socialist movement, revealing the human side of this revolutionary figure. It is an unrivalled portrait of Lenin in the making.	2009-09-03	HUTCHINSON						ZZZ000000

They worry that these new corporate states are accountable to no-one... that their financial clout makes governments beholden to them... The elephants, people feel, are out of control."

Starting in 1974, with her coverage of Nixon's resignation, and culminating with her controversial portraits of Queen Elizabeth II early in 2007, Leibovitz explains what professional photographers do and how they do it. The photographer in this instance is the most highly paid and prolific person in the business. Approximately 90 images are discussed in detail -- the circumstances under which they were taken, with specific technical information (what camera, what settings, what lighting, where the images appeared). The Rolling Stones' tour in 1975, the famous nude session with John Lennon and Yoko Ono hours before Lennon was killed, the American Express and Gap campaigns, Whoopi Goldberg in a bathtub of milk, Demi Moore pregnant and naked on the cover of Vanity Fair, and coverage of the couture collections in Paris with Puff Daddy and Kate Moss are among the subjects of this original and informative work. The photos and stories are arranged chronologically, moving from film to digital. Leibovitz's fans and lovers of great photography will find her stories of how one learns to see -- and then how to photograph -- inspiring.	2008-10-23	Jonathan Cape						ZZZ000000

Over a nine-month period, author and psychologist Oliver James travelled around the world to try and find out why. He discovered how, despite very different cultures and levels of wealth, affluenza is spreading. Cities he visited include Sydney, Singapore, Moscow, Copenhagen, New York and Shanghai. In each place he interviewed groups of people to try to find out not only why this is happening, but also how one can increase one’s emotional immune system. He asks: Why do so many people want what they don’t have, despite being richer and freer from traditional restraints than ever before? In asking this question, he uncovers the way to reconnect with what really matters and learn to value what we have. In other words, how to be successful and stay sane.	2008-09-02	Random House UK						ZZZ000000

Laced throughout with Barbara Cartland’s wit and wisdom, and Francis Marshall’s illustrations, this is a wonderfully evocative insight into the manners of an England that has largely disappeared.	2008	Random House UK						ZZZ000000

Out of that journey he produced this concise masterpiece of journalism and cultural analysis, a vibrant, defiantly unsentimental portrait of a society traumatized by repeated foreign invasions and immured in a mythic vision of its past.

9780307351661	Doing what matters,how to get results that make a difference-- the revolutionary old-school approach	James M. Kilts&John F. Manfredi&Robert Lorber		When Warren Buffett was asked why the Gillette board of directors chose Jim Kilts to be CEO, he said, “Jim made as much sense in terms of talking about business as anybody I’ve ever talked to. If you listen to Jim analyze a business situation you get absolutely no baloney. And, frankly, finding someone like that is a rarity.” There is only one CEO in recent times who has faced—and succeeded at—the extraordinary challenges of leading three major companies—Gillette, Nabisco, and Kraft—into prosperous futures by doing what matters on the fundamentals. That CEO is Jim Kilts. In this vivid first-person account he reveals his system for success that is both cutting-edge and back-to-basics. Doing What Matters—the action plan for identifying and tackling what’s important and ignoring the rest—is the key to winning in a warp-speed world where the need for revolutionary speed and decisiveness increases by the day. Kilts illustrates his ideas with colorful stories, such as “that little red razor.” A new product idea he proposed early on at Gillette, it was initially shelved because “everyone knew you couldn’t sell a red razor,” but went on to become one of Gillette’s biggest marketing successes ever. Jim Kilts’s focus on both business fundamentals and personal attributes provides the “complete package,” showing how to get results that make a difference through:• Intellectual integrity: The ability to face the unvarnished truth about yourself and your business and using what you see as the basis for action.• Generating emotional engagement and enthusiasm: Using the force of your personality and ideas to infuse people and an entire organization with a sense of purpose and mission. • Action: Gillette, with just five product lines, had over 20,000 SKUs. After studying the issue for over two years, there were still 20,000. How Kilts got Gillette off the dime to pare down the number to 7,000 almost overnight is an astonishing example of getting the rubber to meet the road—with enormous benefits to the business. • Understanding the right things through an overarching concept to frame and filter issues: For Jim Kilts it was Total Brand Value, the framework he used in the consumer products industry for achieving better, faster, and more complete results than the competition.Whether you’re CEO of a multibillion-dollar global company, the brand manager for a product, an entrepreneur starting a small business, or just beginning a career, Doing What Matters provides the practical ideas that get results—ranging from a day one action plan for starting a new job to a chorus of cheers and support to a program of total innovation that involves everyone in changes from small to “big bang.”	2007-09-04	Crown Business						ZZZ000000

But the husband is alive, relatively young, and healthy.This is how John Irving’s tenth novel begins; it seems, at first, to be a comedy, perhaps a satire, almost certainly a sexual farce. Yet, in the end, The Fourth Hand is as realistic and emotionally moving as any of Mr. Irving’s previous novels – including The World According to Garp, A Prayer for Owen Meany, and A Widow for One Year – or his Oscar-winning screenplay of The Cider House Rules.The Fourth Hand is characteristic of John Irving’s seamless storytelling and further explores some of the author’s recurring themes – loss, grief, love as redemption. But this novel also breaks new ground; it offers a penetrating look at the power of second chances and the will to change.From the Trade Paperback edition.	2003	Ballantine Books						ZZZ000000
9780375413179	The great transformation,the beginning of our religious traditions	Karen Armstrong		In the ninth century BCE, the peoples of four distinct regions of the civilized world created the religious and philosophical traditions that have continued to nourish humanity to the present day: Confucianism and Daoism in China, Hinduism and Buddhism in India, monotheism in Israel, and philosophical rationalism in Greece. Later generations further developed these initial insights, but we have never grown beyond them. Rabbinic Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, for example, were all secondary flowerings of the original Israelite vision. Now, in The Great Transformation, Karen Armstrong reveals how the sages of this pivotal “Axial Age” can speak clearly and helpfully to the violence and desperation that we experience in our own times. Armstrong traces the development of the Axial Age chronologically, examining the contributions of such figures as the Buddha, Socrates, Confucius, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, the mystics of the Upanishads, Mencius, and Euripides. All of the Axial Age faiths began in principled and visceral recoil from the unprecedented violence of their time. Despite some differences of emphasis, there was a remarkable consensus in their call for an abandonment of selfishness and a spirituality of compassion. With regard to dealing with fear, despair, hatred, rage, and violence, the Axial sages gave their people and give us, Armstrong says, two important pieces of advice: first there must be personal responsibility and self-criticism, and it must be followed by practical, effective action. In her introduction and concluding chapter, Armstrong urges us to consider how these spiritualities challenge the way we are religious today. In our various institutions, we sometimes seem to be attempting to create exactly the kind of religion that Axial sages and prophets had hoped to eliminate. We often equate faith with doctrinal conformity, but the traditions of the Axial Age were not about dogma. All insisted on the primacy of compassion even in the midst of suffering. In each Axial Age case, a disciplined revulsion from violence and hatred proved to be the major catalyst of spiritual change.	2006-03-28	Knopf						ZZZ000000
9780375422706	Amy and Jordan	Mark Beyer		For those of you who thought the comic strip was dead by the end of the twentieth century, here are 292 pieces of proof that you were wrong. Mark Beyer was breathing delirious, heartbreaking, otherworldly life into it by means of Amy and Jordan. Obviously, you weren’t reading New York Press. But I sure was. Voraciously. Back in 1989, when I discovered that Beyer’s strips were appearing regularly in this new “alternative weekly” paper, I quickly became hooked, and a thought seized me: I had to clip and save them–they were exquisite poems of urban despair, dreamy and nightmarish. I was already a fan of Beyer’s talent based on his book Agony (Pantheon, 1988), but these new strips revealed, week by week, a whole new dimension to his work–an ingenious reinvention of panel-design that redefined what a comic strip could be. As with Peanuts, it helps to try and picture these in the context which they first appeared in order to appreciate just how profoundly they emerged from anything else on the newspaper page. Even the “outré” NYP ads and listings which often ran alongside them were hopelessly dull by comparison. One of its most impressive aspects was the way Form served the Content–no matter how eccentric the layout got, it somehow never confused the narrative. And what narrative: it was as if Candide had been transported to the East Village and split in two like an amoeba and holed up in a squat on Avenue C. Along with giant bugs from outer space. So I did clip and save them, and put them into an envelope, which was then placed in a shoebox with a lot of other envelopes (receipts, receipts!), which was shoved to the back of the closet of my sixth-floor walk-up studio apartment, which I moved out of three years later and in the process I unwittingly threw them all away. Which frankly is just the sort of thing that Amy and Jordan would do. Drat. “Oh well,” I thought, once I’d realized it, “at some point someone will collect and publish them, and I’ll get them back that way.” And that was that.  Fast forward more than ten years, to the spring of 2002. During a panel of cartoonists I was chairing in Philadelphia, a member of the audience asked what Mark was working on and where he was. No one seemed to know. The discussion was transcribed and published in The Comics Journal that summer, and in the fall Mark contacted me with the best possible news: He’d read the panel transcript and wanted to publish again. And the Amy and Jordan strips had never been comprehensively collected. So now, as an editor, I was able to grant my own wish. Amy and Jordan ran from 1988 through early 1996. After that, Beyer put cartooning aside to pursue other projects. This book signals his return to the realm of comics, which he says he wants to start making again. We can only hope he does. For now, I’m just thankful I finally have my Amy and Jordan collection back. –Chip Kidd, NYC, 10/03	2004-05-11	Pantheon Books						ZZZ000000

9780385341158	Out of the blue,a history of lightning : science, superstition, and amazing stories of survival	John S. Friedman		The odds of being hit by lightning each year are only about 1 in 750,000 in the U.S. And yet this rare phenomenon has inspired both fear and fascination for thousands of years. In this groundbreaking, brilliantly researched book, journalist John S. Friedman probes lightning’s scientific, spiritual, and cultural roots. Blending vibrant history with riveting first-hand accounts of those who have clashed with lightning and lived to tell about it, Out of the Blue charts an extraordinary journey across the ages that explores our awe and dread in the face of one of nature’s most fearsome spectacles.Herman Melville called it “God’s burning finger.” The ancient Romans feared it as the wrath of God. Today we have a more scientific understanding, so why our eternal fascination with lightning? Out of the Blue attempts to understand this towering force of nature, exploring the changing perceptions of lightning from the earliest civilizations through Ben Franklin’s revolutionary experiments to the hair-raising adventures of storm chasers like David Hoadley, who’s been chronicling extreme weather for half a century. And Friedman describes one of the most treacherous rescues ever attempted in American mountain climbing.Friedman profiles a Virginia ranger who was struck by lightning seven times—and dubbed the human lightning rod—along with scores of others who tell astonishing tales of rescue and survival. And he charts lightning’s profound, life-altering effects on the emotional and spiritual lives of its victims.Combining captivating fact with thrilling personal stories, Out of the Blue tells a remarkable true tale of fate and coincidence, discovery and divine retribution, science and superstition. As entertaining as it is informative, it is a book for outdoor adventurers, sports enthusiasts, science and weather buffs, nature lovers, and anyone who has ever been awed or frightened by the sight of lightning.	2008-05-20	Delacorte Press						ZZZ000000
9780385484480	Who really matters,the Core Group theory of power, privilege, and success	Art Kleiner		In a breakthrough Organization Man for the twenty-first century, bestselling author Art Kleiner reveals that every organization is driven by a desire to satisfy a Core Group of influential individuals and explains why understanding this group’s expectations is the key to success.When corporate leaders announce, with seeming sincerity, “We make our decisions on behalf of our shareholders,” their words are taken at face value. But as recent news stories prove, this imperative is routinely violated. In Who Really Matters, Art Kleiner argues that the dissonance between a declared mission and actual operation can be seen at organizations large and small. All organizations have one motive in common. Every decision—which projects to back, who to promote, or how to spend money—is affected by the perceived wants and needs of a core group of people “who really matter.” The composition of the group can differ from organization to organization. Often, the most senior people in the hierarchy are members—but not always. Sometimes, the people who “matter” can extend far down the corporate ladder, or even reach outside the company to include key customers, labor union leaders, and stockholders. Kleiner gives readers clues about how to identify a core group’s real mission by observing its day-to-day actions, listening to the fundamental message it sends employees, examining its management of new members; understanding the ideas that shape its policies about management, money, and the way the world works; and avoiding the taboos governing the way it operates.Whether you’re a member of the Core Group—or want to be—this deft, engaging blend of argument and observation, anecdotes and advice, is the one guide you’ll need to achieve your career goals and aspirations by navigating the hidden pathways in any organization, large or small.	2003-10-14	Currency/Doubleday						ZZZ000000
9780385513876	Caterpillar kisses,lessons my kindergarten class taught me about life	Christine Pisera Naman		“When [my kindergartners] left me, they left me with the most wonderful memories and the imprints of their kisses upon my heart. To me, the blessed little events, the tiny magical moments, and the wonderful quick coincidences were like kisses.” —From the IntroductionA former kindergarten teacher, Christine Pisera Naman watched over many classes of five-year-olds as they made their way through the school year and discovered new things about themselves and the world around them. In Caterpillar Kisses, she turns her observations and insights into twelve delightful real-life vignettes, one for each month of the year.The stories bring to life events, large and small, that help these wiggly, unsure caterpillars grow into beautiful and confident butterflies. From a first trip to the zoo to making angels in the snow, the kids embrace every new experience with all the silliness, enthusiasm, and wonder familiar to anyone who has spent time with a five-year-old. Naman explores the more difficult moments of childhood as well, offering sensitive, reassuring stories about the fear of thunderstorms and encountering death for the first time. Life lessons are tucked within everyday activities, including a hilarious session of learning (literally) how to walk in the other guy’s shoes and another emphasizing the importance of making others feel accepted. But the students are not the only ones undergoing change. During the course of the year, their teacher learns the best way to deal with too many “apples for the teacher” and comes to understand the true meaning of spirituality and the simple joy of dancing in the rain.Alternately laugh-out-loud funny and poignant, Caterpillar Kisses illustrates the good things that come from looking at life through the eyes of children. It is perfect for anyone looking for the magic in everyday life.“Luminous! Sometimes, when spending time with children, it is just so clear that they are our teachers.  Caterpillar Kisses shows us some of the small but tender lessons we stumble upon during the metamorphosis that occurs each and every day in a young child’s life.”—Ann S.

To every sound. Every suspicion. Every scent and every moment. Then Reacher will trust the people he once trusted with his life—and take this thing all the way to the end.

9781400046898	The next big thing is really small,how nanotechnology will change the future of your business	Jack Uldrich&Deb Newberry		nanotechnology \na-no--tek-'nä-l -je-\ n (1987): the science of manipulating material at the atomic levelAlthough nanotechnology deals with the very small—a nanometer is 1/80,000th the diameter of a human hair—it is going to be huge. From the food we eat, the clothes we wear, and the products we manufacture to the composition of our bodies, everything is made of atoms. And if we can manipulate the atom, then that changes the rules of the game for almost every product.Coal and diamonds, for example, are both constructed from carbon atoms. It’s merely the arrangement of the atoms that differentiates an inexpensive fuel source from a pricey engagement jewel. While the science of nanotech cannot yet transform coal into diamonds, it is advancing rapidly and will begin to radically alter the business world during the next few years—and will continue to do so for the forseeable future. The buzz surrounding nanotech is comparable to that at the dawn of the digital revolution, which changed the face of how business operates. Unlike the Internet, however, which applied new technology to many old processes and businesses, nanotech is about creating entirely new materials, products, and systems (and therefore markets), as well as making existing products faster, stronger, and better.You may be tempted to wait until the buzz dies down before deciding how to integrate nanotech into your business, but don’t make the mistake of thinking of it as being light-years away. Even though it may sound far-off at times, within ten years nanotech will have huge effects on many industries, including manufacturing, health care, energy, agriculture, communications, transportation, and electronics. Within a decade, nanotechnology is expected to be the basis of $1 trillion worth of products in the United States alone and will create anywhere from 800,000 to 2 million new jobs. Nanotechnology will require you to radically re-think what your core business is, who your competitors are, what skills your workforce needs, how to train your employees, and how to think strategically about the future. Jack Uldrich and Deb Newberry explain exactly how you should prepare for nanotech’s imminent arrival. They identify today’s nanotech innovators, chronicle and project the rapid rise of nanotech developments, and show how to think strategically about the field’s opportunities and investments. The Next Big Thing Is Really Small provides a sneak peek at the technology that will transform the next ten years, giving investors and executives a road map for using small wonders to generate big profits.	2003-03-11	Crown Business						ZZZ000000

And how many molecules would it take to create every smell in nature, from roses to stinky feet?• Who was the bigger scent freak: the perfume-obsessed Richard Wagner or Emily Dickinson, with her creepy passion for flowers?• By scenting the air in stores, are retailers turning us into subliminally controlled shopping zombies?• Were Smell-O-Vision and AromaRama mere Hollywood fads or serious technologies?Everything about the sense of smell fascinates us, from its power to evoke memories to its ability to change our moods and influence our behavior. Yet because it is the least understood of the senses, myths abound. For example, contrary to popular belief, the human nose is almost as sensitive as the noses of many animals, including dogs; blind people do not have enhanced powers of smell; and perfumers excel at their jobs not because they have superior noses, but because they have perfected the art of thinking about scents.In this entertaining and enlightening journey through the world of aroma, olfaction expert Avery Gilbert illuminates the latest scientific discoveries and offers keen observations on modern culture: how a museum is preserving the smells of John Steinbeck’s Cannery Row; why John Waters revived the “smellie” in Polyester; and what innovations are coming from artists like the Dutch “aroma jockey” known as Odo7. From brain-imaging laboratories to the high-stakes world of scent marketing, What the Nose Knows takes us on a tour of the strange and surprising realm of smell.	2008-06-24	Crown Publishers						ZZZ000000

To go out into the world or travel across the wilderness, hired mercenaries are essential. One man has built a reputation as an especially fierce monster-killer -- a man known as Leroy Schvartzer. A former high-ranking member of the Guild of Mercenaries, Leroy has struck out on his own. Many try to hire him for his superior skills, but Leroy has his own agenda. He has a mission to accomplish, a vow to fulfill. This vow is known only to himself and his one companion: his sentient long-sword Ragnarok.	2005-04-01	DC Comics						ZZZ000000
9780307276476	Never Let Me Go	Kazuo Ishiguro		As a child, Kathy - now thirty-one years old - lived at Hailsham, a private school in the scenic English countryside where the children were sheltered from the outside world, brought up to believe that they were special and that their well-being was crucial not only for themselves but for the society they would eventually enter. Kathy had long ago put this idyllic past behind her, but when two of her Hailsham friends come back into her life, she stops resisting the pull of memory. And so, as her friendship with Ruth is rekindled, and as the feelings that long ago fueled her adolescent crush on Tommy begin to deepen into love, Kathy recalls their years at Hailsham. She describes happy scenes of boys and girls growing up together, unperturbed - even comforted - by their isolation. But she describes other scenes as well - of discord and misunderstanding that hint at a dark secret behind Hailsham’s nurturing facade. With the dawning clarity of hindsight, the three friends are compelled to face the truth about their childhood - and about their lives now.	2006	Vintage International						ZZZ000000
9780307337924	Can She Be Stopped?,Hillary Clinton Will Be the Next President of the United States Unless...	John Podhoretz		Our Worst Nightmare—and How to Avoid ItIt’s the ultimate nightmare scenario for conservatives: to awaken on the morning of November 5, 2008, to the news that the last swing state has been colored bright blue and Hillary Rodham Clinton is the President-elect of the United States. Could it really happen?Frighteningly, yes. In fact, as bestselling author and leading conservative commentator John Podhoretz reveals, this is not just a scary “what if” scenario; it will happen . . . unless conservatives take immediate action. Sounding the alarm bell with wit and verve, Can She Be Stopped? shows that Hillary’s plan to capture the White House is much further along than her enemies fear. Podhoretz uncovers the host of reasons why—many of them counterintuitive. He also destroys the comfortable myths about Clinton that conservatives cling to: She’s saddled with too many “high negatives.” She’s too liberal to get elected. “Clinton fatigue” will keep her out of the Oval Office. You’ve heard them all, and they’re wrong on every count. After shaking Republicans out of their complacency, Podhoretz lays out the precise strategy conservatives must deploy to stop Hillary dead in her tracks. His groundbreaking ten-point plan of action reveals:• How to expose the real, ultraliberal Hillary• How to "smoke her out" and prevent her from hiding on key issues • How to make her denounce popular Republican programs—and defend unpopular liberal ideas• How to use her Senate seat as a weapon against her• How to overcome the Republican Party’s own problems• Whom the Republicans should nominate (and the choice may surprise you)Conservatives can’t avoid the Hillary problem any longer, or else the nation will be forced to endure another Clinton in the White House. Fortunately, John Podhoretz is here with the detailed blueprint that will spare the country from that disastrous turn of events, in a book as puckishly lively as it is sobering. Can she be stopped? Yes—but only if we get to work . . . now.From the Hardcover edition.	2007-10-23	Three Rivers Press						ZZZ000000

9780345413901	The murder book	Jonathan Kellerman		In seventeen consecutive bestselling novels, Jonathan Kellerman has distinguished himself as the master of the psychological thriller. Now in Kellerman’s most compelling and powerful novel yet, L.A. psychologist-detective Alex Delaware confronts a long-unsolved murder of unspeakable brutality—an ice-cold case whose resolution threatens his survival, and that of longtime friend, homicide detective, Milo Sturgis.The nightmare begins when Alex receives a strange package in the mail with no return address. Inside is an ornate album filled with gruesome crime scene photos—a homicide scrapbook entitled The Murder Book. Alex can find no reason for anyone to send him this compendium of death, but when Milo views the book, he is immediately shaken by one of the images: a young woman, tortured, strangled, and dumped near a freeway ramp.This was one of Milo’s first cases as a rookie homicide cop: a vicious killing that he failed to solve, because just as he and his training partner began to make headway, the department closed them down. Being forced to abandon the young victim tormented Milo. But his fears prevented him from pursuing the truth, and over the years he managed to forget. Or so he thought.Now, two decades later, someone has chosen to stir up the past. As Alex and Milo set out to uncover what really happened twenty years ago, their every move is followed and their lives are placed in jeopardy. The relentless investigation reaches deep into L.A.’s nerve-centers of power and wealth—past and present. While peeling back layer after layer of ugly secrets, they discover that the murder of one forgotten girl has chilling ramifications that extend far beyond the tragic loss of a single life.A classic story of good and evil, sacrifice and sin, The Murder Book is a gripping page-turner that illuminates the darkest corridors of the human mind. It is a stunning tour de force.From the Hardcover edition.	2002	Ballantine Books						ZZZ000000

9780440240945	Emperor,The Gates of Rome	Conn Iggulden		Rarely, if ever, does a new writer dazzle us with such a vivid imagination and storytelling, flawlessly capturing the essence of a land, a people, a legend. Conn Iggulden is just such a writer, bringing to vivid life one of the most fascinating eras in human history. In a true masterpiece of historical fiction, Iggulden takes us on a breathtaking journey through ancient Rome, sweeping us into a realm of tyrants and slaves, of dark intrigues and seething passions. What emerges is both a grand romantic tale of coming-of-age in the Roman Empire and a vibrant portrait of the early years of a man who would become the most powerful ruler on earth: Julius Caesar.On the lush Italian peninsula, a new empire is taking shape. At its heart is the city of Rome, a place of glory and decadence, beauty and bloodshed. Against this vivid backdrop, two boys are growing to manhood, dreaming of battles, fame, and glory in service of the mightiest empire the world has ever known. One is the son of a senator, a boy of privilege and ambition to whom much has been given and from whom much is expected. The other is a bastard child, a boy of strength and cunning, whose love for his adoptive family–and his adoptive brother–will be the most powerful force in his life.As young Gaius and Marcus are trained in the art of combat–under the tutelage of one of Rome’s most fearsome gladiators–Rome itself is being rocked by the art of treachery and ambition, caught in a tug-of-war as two rival generals, Marius and Sulla, push the empire toward civil war. For Marcus, a bloody campaign in Greece will become a young soldier’s proving ground. For Gaius, the equally deadly infighting of the Roman Senate will be the battlefield where he hones his courage and skill. And for both, the love of an extraordinary slave girl will be an honor each will covet but only one will win.The two friends are forced to walk different paths, and by the time they meet again everything will have changed. Both will have known love, loss, and violence. And the land where they were once innocent will be thrust into the grip of bitter conflict–a conflict that will set Roman against Roman...and put their friendship to the ultimate test. Brilliantly interweaving history and adventure, Conn Iggulden conjures a stunning array of contrasts–from the bloody stench of a battlefield to the opulence of the greatest city in history, from the tenderness of a lover to the treachery of an assassin. Superbly rendered, grippingly told, Emperor, The Gates of Rome is a work of vaulting imagination from a powerful new voice in historical fiction.From the Hardcover edition.	2004-02-03	Dell						ZZZ000000

9780517100349	The best of Louisa May Alcott	Louisa May Alcott&Claire Booss		“A splendid edition–the first contemporary collection of Louisa May Alcott’s novels and stories; one that includes the art of the great nineteenth-century illustrator Frank T. Merrill.”—Madelon Bedell, author of The Alcotts: Biography of a FamilyLouisa May Alcott was a writer who liked to be in intimate touch with the reader. There is a confidential immediacy to her style, often punctuated with sly stabs of satire and irony. One of the principal charms of her writing is her great warmth for her characters, and theirs for one another. Nowhere is this better displayed than in the classics Little Women and Little Men, which are here in their entirety. The short stories in THE BEST OF LOUISA MAY ALCOTT come from the period of Alcott’s most powerful and mature writing, which began in the 1860s, when she dealt forcibly with real issues and real people. These stories touch on strong human qualities–joy, compassion, humor, courage, dignity, heart-tugging poignancy, guilt, or fancifulness–and portray the moments when those qualities come into focus.Alcott’s work has a wonderful range. There are delicious romance, like the frankly autobiographical “My Boys,” a rollicking account of some of the author’s experiences, full of her salty, sardonic humor and generosity of spirit. There is also “Cupid and Chow-Chow,” still very relevant today, dealing with courage and guilt, and sexism in the nursery.There is comedy and suspense in “Clams,” a marvelous ghost story. There are wonderful animal stories, including “Rosa’s Tale,” the heroine of which is a horse, as well as a description of a day at the zoo in “My May-Day Among Curious Birds and Beasts.” There are also holiday stories here, like “An Old Fashioned Thanksgiving,” and two Christmas stories: “How It All Happened,” and “Tessa’s Surprise.”And perhaps most moving of all is “A Night”, from Hospital Sketches, the story of a nurse’s vigil at the bedside of an extraordinarily brave and dignified soldier wounded in the Civil War.This charming collection, enhanced by beautiful original illustrations, makes clear the timeless appeal of Louisa May Alcott’s work.	2006-11-07	Gramercy Books						ZZZ000000

Lele		“Competition is the bane of the free enterprise system.” —Anonymous business mogulWhat people on the front lines—making, marketing, and selling products and services—really want is to be alone in the marketplace, to have a space that they own for a long enough period of time so they can make some real money. In this short, powerful book, Milind Lele shows you how.Conventional wisdom attributes winning to having the best products at the lowest prices, a great brand, superior management, and the lowest overhead. All are obviously of great importance, but in actuality anyone can achieve them. Dr. Lele shows that winning comes from focusing on these monopoly rules:• What patch of open market space does this business own—or could it own?• Is the space really open or is it wishful thinking?• Are there enough customers whose needs are not being met and are they willing to spend money to have those needs met?• How long will this space remain open and why?• What do you have to do to capture it and wall it off?• When will the party end and what do we do next?For example, for many coffee lovers there is no one but Starbucks. The moment people found out what coffee could, and should, taste like it was as if a giant lightbulb went off inside their heads—and Starbucks had a monopoly. The best monopoly opportunities are situational, often soft and intangible. They’re segments, not the mass market, and often in the customer’s mind. For the customer there is no one but you, since what you provide can’t be easily copied, duplicated, or ripped off.Monopoly Rules couldn’t come at a better time, as an almost perfect storm seems to be hitting every business. Customers are changing and the homogenous mass market has gone the way of the nickel soda. Now the game is winning market segments. In this world, Monopoly Rules provides a new way to think and take action and stay ahead of the game. Also available as an eBook	2005-08-30	Crown Business						ZZZ000000

In this provocative and inspiring book, David Richo distills thirty years of experience as a therapist to explain the underlying roots of unhappiness—and the surprising secret to finding freedom and fulfillment. There are certain facts of life that we cannot change—the unavoidable "givens" of human existence: (1) everything changes and ends, (2) things do not always go according to plan, (3) life is not always fair, (4) pain is a part of life, and (5) people are not loving and loyal all the time. Richo shows us that by dropping our deep-seated resistance to these givens, we can find liberation and discover the true richness that life has to offer. Blending Western psychology and Eastern spirituality, including practical exercises, Richo shows us how to open up to our lives—including to what is frightening, painful, or disappointing—and discover our greatest gifts.	2008-04-08	Shambhala Publications						ZZZ000000

9780385509534	Beating the business cycle,how to predict and profit from turning points in the economy	Lakshman Achuthan&Anirvan Banerji		How can you make wise decisions about your company and your personal future when you have no idea where the economy is headed?The answer is, you can’t. But you can learn how to accurately predict turns in the economy so that you can see the road ahead. And Beating The Business Cycle shows you how.In Beating the Business Cycle, Lakshman Achuthan and Anirvan Banerji, the directors of the renowned Economic Cycle Research Institute (ECRI) show how anyone can predict and profit from the inevitable booms and busts of the economy. Why should we believe them? Because while so many economists and financial gurus have failed to predict recessions in the past, ECRI’s forecasts are known for being uncannily accurate. The institute successfully predicted the U.S. recession of 2001 many months before the economists did; the 1990 recession and later recovery; and most recently, the weak U.S. recovery in 2002. ECRI is in constant demand by corporate America and the media. It is the “secret weapon” of companies from Disney to DuPont, the major fund managers, and many central banks. Beating the Business Cycle is the first book to reveal how decision makers at all levels—managers, small business owners, and individuals—can see into the economy’s future when making key decisions. Should a large company search out new clients and build new factories or stores, or should it consider cost cutting and layoffs? Is it the right time for you to splurge on that luxury vacation or addition to your house, or would it be more prudent to cut back on big expenditures and save money for a rainy day? Written in an easy-to-understand, accessible style, Beating the Business Cycle takes the guesswork out of deciding which of the hundreds of economic indicators to trust and which ones to trash. It will give you the tools and confidence you need to make the right decisions at the right times—even when the rest of the investing and business world would persuade you otherwise. Whether you are a corporate manager or the owner of a small business, whether you have your money invested in stocks or in your home, Beating the Business Cycle will give you the edge you need to trump the competition and stay ahead of the crowd.	2004-05-18	Currency Doubleday						ZZZ000000
9780385519250	The siege of Mecca,the forgotten uprising in Islam's holiest shrine and the birth of al Qaeda	Yaroslav Trofimov		On November 20, 1979, worldwide attention was focused on Tehran, where the Iranian hostage crisis was entering its third week. The same morning—the first of a new Muslim century—hundreds of gunmen stunned the world by seizing Islam’s holiest shrine, the Grand Mosque in Mecca. Armed with rifles that they had smuggled inside coffins, these men came from more than a dozen countries, launching the first operation of global jihad in modern times. Led by a Saudi preacher named Juhayman al Uteybi, they believed that the Saudi royal family had become a craven servant of American infidels, and sought a return to the glory of uncompromising Islam. With nearly 100,000 worshippers trapped inside the holy compound, Mecca’s bloody siege lasted two weeks, inflaming Muslim rage against the United States and causing hundreds of deaths.Despite U.S. assistance, the Saudi royal family proved haplessly incapable of dislodging the occupier, whose ranks included American converts to Islam. In Iran, Ayatollah Khomeini blamed the Great Satan—the United States —for defiling the shrine, prompting mobs to storm and torch American embassies in Pakistan and Libya. The desperate Saudis finally enlisted the help of French commandos led by tough-as-nails Captain Paul Barril, who prepared the final assault and supplied poison gas that knocked out the insurgents. Though most captured gunmen were quickly beheaded, the Saudi royal family responded to this unprecedented challenge by compromising with the rebels’ supporters among the kingdom’s most senior clerics, helping them nurture and export Juhayman’s violent brand of Islam around the world. This dramatic and immensely consequential story was barely covered in the press in the pre-CNN, pre–Al Jazeera days, as Saudi Arabia imposed an information blackout and kept foreign correspondents away. Yaroslav Trofimov now penetrates this veil of silence, interviewing for the first time scores of direct participants in the siege, including former terrorists, and drawing on hundreds of documents that had been declassified on his request. Written with the pacing, detail, and suspense of a real-life thriller, The Siege of Mecca reveals how Saudi reaction to the uprising in Mecca set free the forces that produced the attacks of 9/11, and the harrowing circumstances that surround us today.	2007	Doubleday						ZZZ000000

9781400054930	Your management sucks,why you have to declare war on yourself-- and your business	Mark Stevens		Like a mirror, Your Management Sucks reveals important truths that you may deal with . . . or choose to ignore or put on the back burner.Everyone manages someone or something . . . your own life and career, an administrative assistant, hundreds or thousands of people. How well or poorly you manage has a profound impact on your personal success. Mark Stevens makes the compelling point that at any given time everyone’s management sucks. It can, however, be improved and rethought so you can move away from patterns and habits that you can easily fall victim to. Start by declaring constructive war on yourself. Look in the mirror and identify those invisible traps and barriers. Then leave the land of business-as-usual with the seven-point plan Stevens has used to build both his own extraordinary career and his marketing and strategy consulting firm. You’ll soon find that you’re in the fast lane, easily outpacing your passive peers who rarely, if ever, challenge the how and why of what they do. Mark Stevens—a street-smart kid from Queens, New York, who has gone on to phenomenal success—not only gives advice to Fortune 500 companies and entrepreneurial start-ups, he takes his own. Concerned that his business, MSCO, would continue its steady but limited growth, he announced one morning during breakfast with his wife, “Honey, I’m going to fire everyone.” That intention, while actually carried out over a lengthy period of time, was based on one simple insight—that his team of good people wouldn’t be able to put MSCO over the top to make it the best. From that episode came the ideas that form the core of Your Management Sucks:• Developing your own personal killer app—the “differentiator” that will make you more than the sum of your parts• Unleashing your virtual Manhattan Project: the plan that will change your life, your business, and the world• Challenging the oxymoron of conventional wisdom• Applying C+A+M: The universal equation for perpetual growthIn the same straight-talking, no-BS style of his last book, Your Marketing Sucks, Stevens offers brass-tacks examples of management approaches that do—and don’t—work and inspires people to ask themselves the tough questions they need to answer in order to become true leaders.Your Seven-Point Declaration of War on Management That Sucks1. Unleash the Power of a Personal Philosophy: Don’t just rock the boat of your business, be prepared to capsize it.2. Challenge the Oxymoron of Conventional Wisdom: The so-called smart thing is all too often stale thinking masquerading as truth.3. Take a Good Look in the Mirror . . . Do You See a Leader? The worst damn thing in the world you can do is copy success. Be an original.4. Develop Your Personal Killer App: Become greater than the sum of your parts.5. Unleash Your Manhattan Project: Implement the plan that will change your world and your life.6. Capture Ideas with a Butterfly Net: Seek out what you need to know and use it for personal growth.7.

Michael Useem—through dramatic storytelling—shows how to master the art and science of being decisive. He places you smack in the middle of people facing their go point, where actions—or lack of them—determined the fates of individuals, companies, and countries. • Why on earth did Robert E. Lee send General George Pickett on an almost suicidal charge against the Union lines at Gettysburg?• How does the leader of a firefighting crew make life-or-death decisions, directing his people—with little information about weather patterns to guide him—to go up or down the mountain? One direction means safety, the other danger.• You’ve just assumed responsibility for a scandal-wracked corporation, a company teetering on the brink of disaster. What you decide over the course of the next several days will have consequences for thousands of employees and investors. How do you fulfill your responsibilities?Michael Useem makes you feel as if “you are there,” right in the center of the action. He was there: tramping up and down the mountain where firefighters made their momentous decisions; walking the battlefield at Gettysburg to see for himself just what General Pickett faced before making his ill-fated charge; going into a trading pit where million-dollar buy-and-sell decisions are made that affect fortunes of both the firm and the person making the call. You’ll discover why some decisions were flawless, perfectly on target, and others utterly disastrous. Most of all, you’ll learn how to make the right calls yourself, whether you’re changing your career, hiring an assistant, launching a product, or deciding on a potential acquisition or merger. Smartly written and offering unusual insights into the minds of decision makers such as General Lee, The Go Point will provide the guidance for you to move with confidence when it’s your turn to get off the fence.

9780345476142	The third secret,a novel	Steve Berry		Explosive in both its pace and its revelations, The Third Secret is a remarkable international thriller. Bestselling author Steve Berry tackles some of the most controversial ideas of our time in a breakneck journey through the history of the Church and the future of religion.Fatima, Portugal, 1917: The Virgin Mary appears to three peasant children, sharing with them three secrets, two of which are soon revealed to the world. The third secret is sealed away in the Vatican, read only by popes, and not disclosed until the year 2000. When revealed, its quizzical tone and anticlimactic nature leave many faithful wondering if the Church has truly unveiled all of the Virgin Mary’s words–or if a message far more important has been left in the shadows.Vatican City, present day: Papal secretary Father Colin Michener is concerned for the Pope. Night after restless night, Pope Clement XV enters the Vatican’s Riserva, the special archive open only to popes, where the Church’s most clandestine and controversial documents are stored. Though unsure of the details, Michener knows that the Pope’s distress stems from the revelations of Fatima.Equally concerned, but not out of any sense of compassion, is Alberto Cardinal Valendrea, the Vatican’s Secretary of State,. Valendrea desperately covets the papacy, having narrowly lost out to Clement at the last conclave. Now the Pope’s interest in Fatima threatens to uncover a shocking ancient truth that Valendrea has kept to himself for many years.When Pope Clement sends Michener to the Romanian highlands, then to a Bosnian holy site, in search of a priest–possibly one of the last people on Earth who knows Mary’s true message–a perilous set of events unfolds. Michener finds himself embroiled in murder, suspicion, suicide, deceit, and his forbidden passion for a beloved woman. In a desperate search for answers, he travels to Pope Clement’s birthplace in Germany, where he learns that the third secret of Fatima may dictate the very fate of the Church–a fate now lying in Michener’s own hands.From the Hardcover edition.	2005	Ballantine Books						ZZZ000000
9780385502979	Zig,The Autobiography of Zig Ziglar	Zig Ziglar		"Zig Ziglar epitomizes determination, perseverance, excellence, and a loving Christian spirit more than anyone I know! The world would be a better place if more of us were just like him."--Kenneth H. Cooper, M.D., The Cooper Clinic, Dallas, TexasZig Ziglar, the motivational speaker who has galvanized audiences around the world and written more than a dozen perennially popular books, brings that same unbounded energy and clarity of vision to this candid, inspiring account of his own life and the forces that shaped it.Every year, Zig Ziglar travels all over the world delivering a resounding message of hope and commitment in forums ranging from high-powered business conferences and church leadership assemblies to youth conventions and educational gatherings. In Zig, Ziglar chronicles another kind of journey: his own transformation from a struggling, not terribly successful salesman to the sales champion of several different companies, and finally to his current position as one of the world's best-known and most highly regarded motivational speakers and trainers. As he describes his experiences, he brings to life the essence of his teachings: “You can have everything in life you want if you will just help enough other people get what they want.”At the heart of Ziglar's story are the people who taught him the importance of balancing a commitment to hard work with compassion for others. His first teacher was his mother, who raised him alone after the early death of his father, and introduced him to the principles and values he has honored for the rest of his life. Her lessons were reinforced by many others–from the men and women who became his business mentors to the friends and spiritual leaders who comforted and supported him when things got tough. Paying tribute to each of them, Ziglar zeroes in on the philosophy and traits that have enabled him to achieve success in business and in his personal life: discipline, hard work, common sense, integrity, commitment, and an infectious sense of humor. Ziglar's speaking engagements and seminars along with a wide array of audio and video materials, books, and training manuals, have helped to trigger positive changes in small businesses, Fortune 500 companies, U.S. government agencies, nonprofit associations, religious organizations, schools, and prisons. At once engaging and enlightening, Zig provides a riveting portrait of the man who has achieved so much by embracing the simple but profound goal of helping others.From the Hardcover edition.	2004-02-17	The Doubleday Religious Publishing Group						ZZZ000000

Using bank records and other previously undisclosed information, Posner unearths many disturbing truths and shattering revelations about the ties that bind the Saudi and U.S. governments, including• how countless failures in U.S. intelligence and law enforcement gave extraordinary preferential treatment to prominent Saudis living in the United States, including members of the bin Laden family, in the days after 9/11• a likely close connection between a powerful member of the House of Saud and Abu Zubeydah, the highest-ranking al-Qaeda operative captured so far by the United States• how the Saudi government has turned a blind eye to the role Saudi charities–including many controlled or supported by Kingdom officials– have played in bankrolling al-Qaeda and Islamic terror groups• the never-before-revealed Saudi and U.S. emergency plans in the event of a national crisis in the Kingdom, plans that could affect the security of the United States and the entire Middle EastSecrets of the Kingdom is an explosive study that will have a profound impact on both U.S. policy and Americans’ perception of their government and its extensive ties to a foreign power.

It is cold enough to crack stones, and when the snow falls it is gray. They sky is dark. Their destination is the coast, although they don't know what, if anything, awaits them there.

This book boldly imagines a future in which no hope remains, but in which the father and his son, "each the other's world entire," are sustained by love. It is an unflinching meditation on the worst and the best that we are capable of: ultimate destructiveness, desperate tenacity, and the tenderness that keeps two people alive in the face of total devastation.--From publisher description.	2007-05-01	Vintage International						ZZZ000000

9780307393531	Managing the dragon,how I'm building a billion-dollar business in China	Jack Perkowski		The first book by a westerner who built a company in China from scratchThe emergence of China as a world economic power is one of the biggest stories of our time. Every business that intends to be an important part of the fast-changing global economy needs to know how to play the game in China. Who better to be your guide than Jack Perkowski, the pioneer who went to China in the early 1990s. Equipped with just a concept, he built a company step-by-step from the ground up–ASIMCO Technologies–that became a major player in China’s fast-growing automotive business. Perkowski’s story is as rich, involving, and improbable as those of nineteenth-century titans such as Rockefeller and Carnegie or of twentieth-century ones like Michael Dell and Bill Gates, but with one obvious difference: They and others built their companies when America was emerging or dominant. Perkowski built his at the dawn of the Chinese century. Perkowski’s insights about the challenges and potential of western involvement in today’s great Chinese expansion–gained on the ground in China itself over the past fifteen years–are of inestimable value and relevance to us all. For instance:• The good news about China: Everything is possible. The bad news: Nothing is easy.• To build a business in China, you must develop a local management team–avoiding both former bureaucrats of the state-run enterprises and the country’s new breed of wildcat entrepreneurs.• You must learn the real reason why China is able to produce goods so cheaply.• Forget your notions about the Chinese economy being rigidly controlled by Beijing–it is, in fact, highly decentralized and locally driven. As the Chinese say, “The mountains are high and the emperor is far away.”Perkowski tells his story with clarity, lots of humor, and a gripping sense of adventure. He takes us along on his own version of the Long March, when he visited two factories a day for nine months, hitting every province, going through endless rounds of dinners and the inevitable drinking games, and eating what seemed like every part of every animal. He vividly describes what it’s like to be a westerner living and working in China and the dramatic transformation he’s seen in the country, from a place left behind by the modern world to a place where a new world is being born.Filled with hard-nosed lessons for anyone with ambitions of breaking into the Chinese market, and a rich source of practical wisdom about the realities of China today, Managing the Dragon answers the questions people ask Perkowski most often about his unique experience, as well as those they never think of asking–but should.	2008-03-18	Crown Business						ZZZ000000

In the AFC Championship game against Denver, to the surprise and dismay of virtually everyone, Rick actually got into the game. With a 17-point lead and just minutes to go, Rick provided what was arguably the worst single performance in the history of the NFL. Overnight, he became a national laughingstock and, of course, was immediately cut by the Browns and shunned by all other teams.But all Rick knows is football, and he insists that his agent, Arnie, find a team that needs him. Against enormous odds Arnie finally locates just such a team and informs Rick that, miraculously, he can in fact now be a starting quarterback–for the mighty Panthers of Parma, Italy.Yes, Italians do play American football, to one degree or another, and the Parma Panthers desperately want a former NFL player–any former NFL player–at their helm. So Rick reluctantly agrees to play for the Panthers–at least until a better offer comes along–and heads off to Italy. He knows nothing about Parma, has never been to Europe, and doesn’t speak or understand a word of Italian. To say that Italy holds a few surprises for Rick Dockery would be something of an understatement.From the Trade Paperback edition.	2008-06-08	Dell Publishing Company						ZZZ000000

9780345496980	Seducing the Boys Club,Uncensored Tactics from a Woman at the Top	Nina DiSesa		Fact #1: Forty years after the feminist revolution, fewer than 2 percent of Fortune 1000 CEOs are women.Fact #2: The playing field is not level.Fact #3: You need to get over this.From the woman who became chairman of the flagship office of the largest advertising agency network in the world comes a wry reality check on how to get ahead and thrive in the testosterone-driven business arena.Nina DiSesa is a master communicator, a ceiling crasher, and one of the most successful women in the corporate world. She is also a big-time realist who has figured out that S&M–seduction and manipulation–is the secret to winning over (and surpassing) the big guys. In Seducing the Boys Club, DiSesa shows that you can, in fact, leave your male colleagues in the dust–but not by following the rules you learned in business school. By playing the roles of den mother, fraternity brother, little sister, and hard-nosed boss, DiSesa navigated the choppy, macho-minded waters of the workplace. All the “bad boys” in her life–and there are many–have provided a wealth of devilishly amusing stories and cautionary tales that DiSesa is only too happy to pass on. Ah, revenge can be sweet, but the truth is that she came to love those boys as much as they love her–which is the whole point.DiSesa asserts that women need to meld their feminine characteristics (nurturing, compassion, listening) with the traits of their male counterparts (competitiveness, decisiveness, combativeness) to expand their professional horizons. In Seducing the Boys Club, DiSesa shares her practical, outrageous, and even controversial maxims for making it, including:• Learn to appreciate men. Men like women who like them.• Remember that women are biologically wired to succeed.• If you want to make a name for yourself, find a mess and fix it. A secure and comfortable job only holds you back.• Don’t assume that men never listen. They listen like a dog does.• Don’t be a quiet achiever.• Act brave and you will look brave.• Screw the rules. Make up your own.Whether dead-on funny or deadly serious, DiSesa is always on her game, always on message, and absolutely on target as she arms women with the can-do confidence and no-compromises attitude they need to climb as high as their ambition can carry them–while keeping their standards impeccable and their integrity intact. Not for women only, this book should be read by men, too . . . though it won’t give them any defense against a woman who can truly seduce a boys club!	2008-01-29	Ballantine Books						ZZZ000000

9780553583410	Locked Rooms	Laurie R. King		Mary Russell and her husband Sherlock Holmes are back in Laurie R. King’s highly acclaimed New York Times bestselling mystery series. And this time the first couple of detection pair up to unlock the buried memory of a shocking crime with the power to kill again–lost somewhere in Russell’s own past.After departing Bombay by ship, Mary Russell and her husband Sherlock Holmes are en route to the bustling modern city of San Francisco. There, Mary will settle some legal affairs surrounding the inheritance of her family’s old estate. But the closer they get to port, the more Mary finds herself prey to troubling dreams and irrational behavior–a point not lost on Holmes, much to Russell’s annoyance.In 1906, when Mary was six, San Francisco was devastated by an earthquake and a raging fire that reduced the city to rubble. For years, Mary has denied any memory of the catastrophe that for days turned the fabled streets into hell on earth. But Holmes suspects that some hidden trauma connected with the “unforgettable” catastrophe may be the real culprit responsible for Mary’s memory lapse. And no sooner do they begin to familiarize themselves with the particulars of the Russell estate than it becomes apparent that whatever unpleasantness Mary has forgotten, it hasn’t forgotten her. Why does her father’s will forbid access to the house except in the presence of immediate family? Why did someone break in, then take nothing of any value? And why is Russell herself targeted for assassination?The more questions they ask of Mary’s past, the more people from that past turn out to have died violent, unexplained deaths. Now, with the aid of a hard-boiled young detective and crime writer named Hammett, Russell and Holmes find themselves embroiled in a mystery that leads them through the winding streets of Chinatown to the unspoken secrets of a parent’s marriage and the tragic car “accident” that a fourteen-year-old Mary alone survived–an accident that may not have been an accident at all. What Russell is about to discover is that even a forgotten past never dies…and it can kill again.From the Hardcover edition.	2006-03-28	Bantam Books						ZZZ000000

Bueno		Like religious cults that can attract thousands of devoted disciples, is it possible for company brands to build legions of loyal followers? In a marketer's dream come true, can certain products—with the right combination of positioning and branding—take on magnetic characteristics and galvanize die-hard customers who become walking, talking viral marketers? Can your company harness the power of cult branding without blowing a fortune on advertising?According to authors Matthew W. Ragas and Bolivar J. Bueno the answer is yes. In fact, you need not look much farther than a Harley-Davidson rally, a Star Trek convention, or a Jimmy Buffett concert to see the cult branding phenomenon at work: thousands of passionate, faithful fans spreading the good word and spending lots of money. Not all brands have the dash of edginess, the devoted fan base, or the niche positioning to be cult brands. But those that do tend to share similar characteristics that make them successful, what the authors call the Seven Golden Rules of Cult Branding. Through meticulous research and scores of interviews Ragas and Bueno have uncovered the remarkable and oft-untold stories behind nine very successful cult brands:·Star Trek ·Harley-Davidson ·Oprah Winfrey ·World Wrestling Entertainment (formerly WWF) ·Apple ·Volkswagen Beetle ·Jimmy Buffett ·Vans Shoes ·LinuxThese nine brands follow the Seven Golden Rules and have millions of fans and billions of dollars in revenue to show for it. Now you can learn first hand what these special brands did to set themselves apart and how to apply the Seven Golden Rules to your own marketing strategies.Written for advertisers, marketers, sales executives, and business owners who want to thrive in an increasingly competitive marketplace, The Power of Cult Branding is the ultimate guide to creating a loyal core of repeat customers and winning the positioning battle.	2002-09-24	Prima						ZZZ000000

9781400096251	Magic seeds	V.S. Naipaul		A stunning novel of the present moment that takes us into the hearts and minds of those who use terrorism as an ideal and a way of life, and those who aspire to the frightening power of wealth. Abandoning a life he felt was not his own, Willie Chandran (the hero of Half a Life) moves to Berlin where his sister’s radical political awakening inspires him to join a liberation movement in India. There, in the jungles and dirt-poor small villages, through months of secrecy and night marches, Willie - a solitary, inward man - discovers both the idealism and brutality of guerilla warfare. When he finally escapes the movement, he is imprisoned for the murder of three policemen. Released unexpectedly on condition he return to England, he attempts to climb back into life in the West, but his experience of wealth, love and despair in London only bedevils him further. 'Magic Seeds' is a moving tale of a man searching for his life and fearing he has wasted it, and a testing study of the conflicts between the rich and the poor, and the struggles within each. Its spare, elegant prose sizzles with devastating psychological analysis, bleak humour and astonishing characters. Only V. S. Naipaul could have written a novel so attuned to the world and so much a challenge to it.	2005-01-01	Vintage						FIC027000

9780440226109	Black and blue,a novel	Anna Quindlen		For eighteen years, Fran Benedetto kept her secret.  And hid her bruises.  And stayed with Bobby because she wanted her son to have a father.  And because, in spite of everything, she loved him.  Then one night, when she saw the look on her ten-year-old son's face, Fran finally made a choice--and ran for both their lives.--Now she is starting over in a city far from home, far from Bobby.  And in this place she uses a name that isn't hers, and cradles her son in her arms, and tries to forget.  For the woman who now calls herself Beth, every day is a chance to heal, to put together the pieces of her shattered self.  And every day she waits for Bobby to catch up to her.  Because Bobby always said he would never let her go.  And despite the flawlessness of her escape, Fran Benedetto is certain of one thing: It is only a matter of time.--	1998	Dell						ZZZ000000
9781400065929	The Either/Or Investor,How to Succeed in Global Investing, One Decision at a Time	Clark Winter		A REVOLUTIONARY AND DISARMINGLY SIMPLE ROAD MAP FOR INVESTORS IN THE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURYPeople today are inundated with advice, opinions, and information about how to invest. The more data you accumulate, the thinking goes, the better decisions you’ll make. In The Either/Or Investor, global investment strategist Clark Winter shows that the opposite is the case, introducing a revelatory way of thinking about the markets based on finding and assessing just enough of the right information and using your common sense.According to Winter, investing comes down to making choices. All great investors employ an “either/or” filter for evaluating and simplifying the many investment opportunities available to them. The Either/Or Investor reveals how you can emulate this thought process while remaining realistic about your own goals and needs and gives you the tools to choose among the options that modern investors face, such as: • fear versus greed: In an anxious post-9/11 world, discover when it’s smart to make an aggressive financial move.• developed world versus developing world: Find out if you should stick with opportunities in the United States or risk those available in the emerging economies of China, Russia, India, Mexico, and Turkey.• anti-immigration versus migration of talent: Learn to evaluate the products that immigrants introduce to the rest of the world in order to assess the value in investing in American companies that cater to new immigrant groups.• too much information versus too little information: Use the Internet, newspapers, and TV to your advantage. (For example, get the pros and cons about China’s growing economic power so you can become informed enough to act.)• rising interest rates versus falling interest rates: Understand how changing interest rates are a good barometer for how to spend your money. Winter shows how anyone can learn to make sound decisions in a changing world by discerning trends early in an investment cycle, and then taking advantage of these trends or steering clear. Winter also explains how to choose a money manager and how to determine what the next investment opportunities might be.Armed with Winter’s methods, any investor can improve his or her own investment prowess. The Either/Or Investor is a way–both judicious and daring–for choosing a better future.	2008-08-26	Random House						ZZZ000000

9780553588729	The Happiest Baby on the Block,The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Baby Sleep Longer	Harvey Karp		In perhaps the most important parenting book of the decade, Dr. Harvey Karp reveals an extraordinary treasure sought by parents for centuries --an automatic “off-switch” for their baby’s crying.No wonder pediatricians across the country are praising him and thousands of Los Angeles parents, from working moms to superstars like Madonna and Pierce Brosnan, have turned to him to learn the secrets for making babies happy.Never again will parents have to stand by helpless and frazzled while their poor baby cries and cries. Dr. Karp has found there IS a remedy for colic. “I share with parents techniques known only to the most gifted baby soothers throughout history …and I explain exactly how they work.”In a innovative and thought-provoking reevaluation of early infancy, Dr. Karp blends modern science and ancient wisdom to prove that newborns are not fully ready for the world when they are born. Through his research and experience, he has developed four basic principles that are crucial for understanding babies as well as improving their sleep and soothing their senses:·The Missing Fourth Trimester: as odd as it may sound, one of the main reasons babies cry is because they are born three months too soon.·The Calming Reflex: the automatic reset switch to stop crying of any baby in the first few months of life.·The 5 “S’s”: the simple steps (swaddling, side/stomach position, shushing, swinging and sucking) that trigger the calming reflex. For centuries, parents have tried these methods only to fail because, as with a knee reflex, the calming reflex only works when it is triggered in precisely the right way. Unlike other books that merely list these techniques Dr. Karp teaches parents exactly how to do them, to guide cranky infants to calm and easy babies to serenity in minutes…and help them sleep longer too.·The Cuddle Cure: the perfect mix the 5 “S’s” that can soothe even the most colicky of infants.In the book, Dr. Karp also explains:What is colic?Why do most babies get much more upset in the evening?How can a parent calm a baby--in mere minutes?Can babies be spoiled?When should a parent of a crying baby call the doctor?How can a parent get their baby to sleep a few hours longer?Even the most loving moms and dads sometimes feel pushed to the breaking point by their infant’s persistent cries. Coming to the rescue, however, Dr. Karp places in the hands of parents, grandparents, and all childcare givers the tools they need to be able to calm their babies almost as easily as…turning off a light.From the Hardcover edition.	2005-12-27	Bantam Books						ZZZ000000

9781416553281	Fidel Castro,my life : a spoken autobiography	Fidel Castro&Ignacio Ramonet&Andrew Hurley		Fidel Castro is perhaps the most charismatic and controversial head of state in modern times. A dictatorial pariah to some, he has become a hero and inspiration for many of the world's poor, defiantly charting an independent and revolutionary path for Cuba over nearly half a century.Numerous attempts have been made to get Castro to tell his own story. But only now, in the twilight of his years, has he been prepared to set out the details of his remarkable biography for the world to read. This book is nothing less than his living testament. As he told reporters, his desire to finish checking its text was the one thing that kept him going through his recent illness. He presented a copy of the book in its Spanish edition to his compadre President Hugo Chávez of Venezuela.In these pages, Castro narrates a compelling chronicle that spans the harshness of his elementary school teachers; the early failures of the revolution; his intense comradeship with Che Guevara and their astonishing, against-all-odds victory over the dictator Batista; the Cuban perspective on the Bay of Pigs and the ensuing missile crisis; the active role of Cuba in African independence movements (especially its large military involvement in fighting apartheid South Africa in Angola); his relations with prominent public figures such as Boris Yeltsin, Pope John Paul II, and Saddam Hussein; and his dealings with no less than ten successive American presidents, from Eisenhower to George W. Bush.Castro talks proudly of increasing life expectancy in Cuba (now longer than in the United States); of the half million students in Cuban universities; and of the training of seventy thousand Cuban doctors nearly half of whom work abroad, assisting the poor in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. He is confronted with a number of thorny issues, including democracy and human rights, discrimination toward homosexuals, and the continuing presence of the death penalty on Cuban statute books. Along the way he shares intimacies about more personal matters: the benevolent strictness of his father, his successful attempt to give up cigars, his love of Ernest Hemingway's novels, and his calculation that by not shaving he saves up to ten working days each year.Drawing on more than one hundred hours of interviews with Ignacio Ramonet, a knowledgeable and trusted interlocutor, this spoken autobiography will stand as the definitive record of an extraordinary life lived in turbulent times.	2008	Scribner						ZZZ000000

These 'tomorrow men' - or so they are dubbed by Fury - say they have come to make 'minor' adjustments in the timeline in order to eliminate a terrible threat to their era. As time goes on, the Ultimates place more and more trust in the tomorrow men, until Tony Stark shocks everyone by exposing the visitors' true, horrific agenda. They come from the future all right, but not from OUR future. They come from a separate branch of the timeline, one where The Ultimates don't exist, and where, after his death, Stark's company has turned the world into a polluted, anarchy-ridden shambles. Their goal is to open a rift in time big enough to allow a privileged class - their employers - to emigrate to the twenty-first century and escape the depredations of their own time, crushing the twenty-first century's people to make room for their own.	2007-01-02	Pocket						ZZZ000000

9781847392664	Tsar	Ted Bell		Somewhere in Russia is a man so powerful that no one even knows his name. Yet though he is all but invisible, he is pulling strings - and pulling them hard. With her finger on the switch to the European economy and her sights on the American jugular, Russia gains a new leader. Not just a president, he has been appointed Tsar, a signal to the world that the old imperial power is back - and plans to have her day. At the same time, a mysterious killer brutally murders an innocent American family, in the process blowing up the small midwestern town they called home. Just a taste, according to the new Tsar, of what will happen if America does not step aside in preventing Russia's plans to 'reintegrate' her rogue states. Onto this nightmarish stage steps special agent extraordinaire Alex Hawke, the only man - both the British and Americans agree - who can stop the madness.	2009-08-03	Centraal Boekhuis						FIC030000
9781847393456	The song is you	Megan Abbott		On October 7, 1949, dark-haired starlet Jean Spangler kissed her five-year-old daughter good-bye and left for a night shoot at a Hollywood studio. She was never seen again. The only clues left behind: a purse with a broken strap found in a nearby park, a cryptic note, and rumours about mobster boyfriends and ill-fated romances with movie stars. Drawing on this true-life missing person case, Megan Abbott's The Song Is You tells the story of Gil 'Hop' Hopkins, a smooth-talking Hollywood publicist whose career, despite his complicated personal life, is on the rise. It is 1951, two years after Jean's disappearance, and Hop finds himself unwillingly drawn into the still unsolved mystery by a friend of Jean who blames Hop for concealing details about Jean's whereabouts the night she vanished. Driven by guilt and fear of blackmail, Hop delves into the case himself, feverishly trying to stay one step ahead of an intrepid female reporter also chasing the story. Hop thought he'd seen it all, but what he uncovers both tantalizes and horrifies him as he plunges deeper and deeper into Hollywood's substratum in his attempt to uncover the truth.	2009-04-06	Pocket Books						ZZZ000000
9781847393562	War within	Bob Woodward		In his fourth book on President George W. Bush and his controversial 'War on Terror,' Bob Woodward takes us behind closed doors, into the hidden rooms of the White House, the Pentagon, the State Department, and US intelligence agencies, where the details of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan were fiercely debated and eventually determined. Today, the Iraq War is a major source of contention around the world, and may become the defining political, social and moral issue of this brief period in American history. In an attempt to understand the Bush presidency, and its divisive legacy, Woodward examines this conflict at its source: in Washington D.C. This fast-paced, groundbreaking book includes never-before-published information, as Woodward draws upon his vast experience a veteran political journalist to provide a richly detailed and meticulously researched examination of the war in Iraq over the past two years. In The War Within, Woodward expands upon his study of the Bush administration in his previous three books, with his signature authoritative, measured, and deeply human sense of perspective.	2009-06-01	Simon & Schuster, Limited						ZZZ000000
9781847397706	Gross Misconduct,My Year of Excess in the City	Venetia Thompson		Venetia Thompson takes the reader on a rollercoaster ride inside the final year of excess in the City. Working as one of only a few female inter-dealer bond brokers, the blonde ex-public school girl (nicknamed 'posh bird' and 'airbags' ) threw herself headlong into a 'work hard, play hard' culture of extravagance. Determined not to be bullied by the brash Essex wide boys and Alpha males around her, she partied with as much gusto as her colleagues, taking all the life offered: the £900 bottles of wine, the six-hour lunches, the days out at Cartier Polo, the Champagne-fuelled nights at lap-dancing clubs, the Chanel handbags and the meaningless sex. Then, as easily as she'd slipped into the life, she was catapulted back out, when a satirical article she penned for The Spectator, spilled the beans on how her co-workers and bosses really behaved. Now, in Gross Misconduct, Thompson tells the full, unexpurgated story of what really went on in the mad, macho world of London's City traders during the boom years.	2010-04-01	POCKET BOOKS						ZZZ000000

9781416502623	Seventies,The Sights, Sounds and Ideas of a Brilliant Decade	Howard Sounes		When people think of culture in the 1970s they usually conjure up a confetti of kitsch, a jumble of disposable trash in which pet rocks vie for space with the Partridge Family to the tune of the Bay City Rollers. It was, so the received wisdom goes, the decade that taste forgot, a cultural wasteland compared to the decade that preceded it or those that have followed it. Not so, as Howard Sounes argues brilliantly and convincingly in this breathtaking tour of a decade's cultural endeavour. The 1970s may have had flares and big hair, but it also had Martin Scorsese, Lou Reed, David Hockney, Iris Murdoch, Jack Nicholson, David Bowie, John Updike, Diane Arbus, Monty Python, Richard Rogers -- and, of course, Snoopy. Weaving the stories of these and many other key figures together in a mesmerising and compelling mosaic, Howard Sounes shows why their contributions had such resonance at the time and why they still retain their cachet now. In doing so he completely re-invents the reputation of a decade, revealing the 1970s to be far richer and more significant in the shaping of the twenty-first-century world than we could have imagined.	2007-07-31	POCKET BOOKS						SOC022000
9781416522034	The Fall of the House of Bush,The Delusions of the Neoconservatives and American Armageddon	Craig Unger		Conventional wisdom has it that the Middle East crisis is the product of a clash of civilizations between Islam and the West. THE FALL OF THE HOUSE OF BUSH frames that conflict as part of an entirely different paradigm -- namely, the ongoing war between faith and reason, between fundamentalisms (Islamic, Jewish, Christian) and the modern, scientific, post-Enlightenment world. It tells the story of how radical, neoconservative ideologues secretly formed an alliance with the Christian Right in the Bush White House -- and how, driven by delusional idealism and ideological and religious zeal, they waged unilateral and pre-emptive war in the Middle East as well as a domestic war against reason, science and civil liberties. Extending the investigative reach deployed so devastatingly in HOUSE OF BUSH, HOUSE OF SAUD, Craig Unger's brilliant exposé shows the real intentions -- and likely outcomes -- of the Bush administration's true playbook.	2008-07-07	Simon & Schuster, Limited						ZZZ000000

9781847390066	Munich,The 1938 Appeasement Crisis	David Faber		On 30 September 1938 Neville Chamberlain flew back to London from his meeting at Munich with the German Chancellor, Adolf Hitler. As he paused on the aircraft steps, he held aloft the piece of paper which bore both his and the Führer's signature, the promise that Britain and Germany would never go to war with one another again. He had returned bringing 'Peace with honour - Peace for our Time.' Drawing on a wealth of original archival material, David Faber sheds new light on this extraordinary story, tracing the key incidents leading up to the meeting at Munich and its immediate aftermath: Lord Halifax's ill-fated visit to Hitler; Chamberlain's secret negotiations with Mussolini, and the Berlin scandal that rocked Hitler's régime. He takes us to Vienna, to the Sudetenland, and to Prague. In Berlin, we witness Hitler inexorably preparing for war; and in London, we watch helplessly as Chamberlain makes one supreme effort after another to appease Hitler.	2009-04-06	Simon + Schuster UK						ZZZ000000

9780743275408	Freedom for sale,how we made money and lost our liberty	John Kampfner		Why is it that so many people around the world appear willing to give up freedoms in return for either security or prosperity? For the past 60 years it had been assumed that capitalism was intertwined with liberal democracy, that the two not just thrived together but needed each other to survive. But what happens when both are undermined? Governments around the world -- whether they fall into the authoritarian or the democratic camp -- have drawn up a new pact with their peoples. These are its terms: repression is selective, confined to those who openly challenge the status quo, who publicly go out of their way to 'cause trouble'. The number of people who fall into that category is actually very few. The rest of the population can enjoy freedom to travel, to live more or less as they wish, and to make and spend their money. This is the difference between public freedoms and private freedoms. We choose different freedoms we are prepared to cede. We all do it. Freedom for Sale will set a new agenda. Mixing narrative from different countries around the world, it breaks new ground in revealing the extent to which the old assumptions and securities have died. It will crucially ask why so many intelligent and ambitious citizens around the world, particularly among the young, seemed prepared to sacrifice freedom of the press and freedom of speech in their quest for wealth. A new world order may well be upon us, and in this gripping and devastating book John Kampfner reveals how it may just be too late to stop it.	2009-09-07	Simon & Schuster						ZZZ000000

9781847371409	The Clinton Tapes,Wrestling History in the White House	Taylor Branch		Branch interviewed President Clinton 78 times between 1993 and 2001 for roughly two hours each time. The President's side of those conversations formed the basis of his own memoir. Branch, immediately after each session, recorded his take not only on the content of their conversations, but on Clinton's demeanor, moods, puzzlements and the homely aspects of his and his family's life in the West Wing. Because the mission was confidential, Branch encountered mostly the permanent, anonymous staff at the official residence: the ushers and butlers, who guided him to await Clinton in various rendezvous spots. Several tape sessions took place in the family den next to the President's bedroom, on a table next to Hillary's collection of ornamental frogs, or in the upstairs Solarium. Most took place in the President's private office. The book highlights major events from Clinton's two terms, including war in Bosnia, the antideficit crusade, health reform failure, antterrorist strikes, peace initiatives, the 1996 re-election campaign, and Whitewater investigations culminating in his 1999 impeachment trial. It is a rare look at the pressures of a job that Branch watched age this relatively young president.	2009-11-02	Simon & Schuster Uk						ZZZ000000

But in the Pinkerton household a nineteenth-century embarrassment remains. Alice Pinkerton. Alice isn't mad exactly, but she's not sane either. She is tolerated, free to wander about, free to accompany her family to tea parties - free to be treated like a simpleton. But in truth Alice's mind is razor sharp, honed by a restless imagination, years of reading and a profound contempt for her surroundings. Left alone to read, to think, she has devoured the world that brings her mind alive: Shakespeare, Oscar Wilde, Michelangelo, Whitman, Poe, they are her inspiration; Jane Eyre, Catherine Moreland, Desdemona her companions. As she moves through the witless world around her, observing its prejudices, its shallow culture and its vanity, it is society that prompts her observations, viewing all through the prism of the art that has sustained and nourished her lonely life.	2005-09-05	Scribner						ZZZ000000

9781847373922	The General,Charles de Gaulle and the France He Saved	Jonathan Fenby		No leader of modern times was more unique and more uniquely national than Charles de Gaulle. As founder and first President of the Fifth Republic, General de Gaulle saw himself 'carrying France on my shoulders'. When he first emerged on to the world stage in 1940, his insistence that he spoke for his nation might well have appeared impossibly arrogant for a recently promoted junior general who had never been elected to anything. But he personified many of the traits of his country which fascinate the rest of the world - its pride in itself, its intransigence, its historical and cultural heritage and its quasi-religious belief in the state. Le Genéral, as he became known from 1940 on, appeared as if carved from a single monumental block, but was, in fact, extremely complex, a man with deep personal feelings and recurrent mood swings, devoted to his family and often seeking reassurance from those around him. Though insisting on discipline and loyalty from others, he was a great rebel. A grand visionary with a vast geo-political grasp and elephantine memory, he was also a supreme tactician with a taste for secrecy and the ability to out-flank opponents. This is a magisterial, sweeping biography of one of the great leaders of the twentieth century and of the country with which he so identified himself. Written with terrific verve and narrative skill, and yet rigorous and detailed, it brings alive as never before the private man as well as the public leader through exhaustive research and astute analysis.	2010	Simon & Schuster, Limited						ZZZ000000

9780743489614	The Summer I Dared	Barbara Delinsky		What comes after the moment that changes your life forever? This is the question that haunts Julia Bechtel, Noah Prine, and Kim Collela, the only survivors of a horrific boating accident off the coast of Maine. Julia, a forty-year-old wife and mother, has always done exactly what other expect of her. Pigeonholed by her controlling family and distant husband as 'loyal' and 'obedient', she realises in the aftermath of her brush with death that there is more to her - and to the world - than she ever imagined. Feeling strangely connected to Noah, the divorced, taciturn lobsterman who helped save her life, and Kim, a twenty-one-year old whose role in the accident - and subsequent muteness - are a mystery, Julia begins to explore the unique possibilities offered by the quiet island of Big Sawyer. With each passing moment, each new discovery, she grows every more sure that after coming face to face with death, she must have more from life. Set in a beautifully rendered Maine, where lobstermen leave with the tides each morning to hoist their traps and neighbours gather each night to feat on the catch of the day, THE SUMMER I DARED is a deeply moving story of the risky but rewarding search for self. Barbara Delinsky's latest work is ultimately a story of survival, of the irrepressible ability of the human spirit to rebound from disaster and make life anew.	2005-08-01	Pocket Books						ZZZ000000

When she finds herself jilted at the altar by her fiancé Jason, Zoe knows she doesn't deserve this heartache and humiliation. Unable to face the pitying faces of her friends and family, Zoe takes drastic action: she flees to America. Specifically, to Boston, where she takes up a post as nanny to five-year-old Ruby Miller and her little brother Samuel. Ruby and Samuel have lost their mother in an accident. They may as well have lost their father, too, for Ryan Miller is so wrapped-up in his grief that he barely notices his two attention-starved children. As Zoe sets about tidying up Ruby and Sam's home, and injecting some fun back into their lives, she finds herself gaining their trust and love. At the same time, Zoe grows more and more frustrated with Ryan's bullying behaviour, and his shameful neglect. Whatever happened to the loving man she keeps hearing about from his neighbours? Zoe can't find any sign of him. The only thing saving Zoe from despair is the small, close-knit group of British nannies who quickly befriend her. There's boisterous Trudie, man-mad but hiding a painful secret; Sloanie traveller Amber, who sports a Buddhist tattoo that, unbeknownst to her, reads 'Batteries Not Included'. And chilly, tight-lipped Felicity, whose cut-glass voice gives little away. But will these new friends be able to save Zoe, when she discovers that the past isn't all that easy to escape, no matter how far you go?	2009-07-07	Pocket						ZZZ000000

9783822842690	Shop America,midcentury storefront design, 1938-1950	Steven Heller&Jim Heimann		Window shopping In postwar America, everything pointed to a bright, shiny future. Sheer optimism and opulence informed everything from automobile design to architecture, infusing design with larger-than-life planes and curves. Storefront design of the era is particularly indicative of this phenomenon, incarnated here in an extensive collection of hand-illustrated shop window designs from 1938 to 1950. These spectacular, often grandiose plans for grocery stores, shoe shops, beauty salons, bakeries, and more are reminders of a time when stores were sacred shrines for the congregation of American shoppers?impressive and even slightly intimidating, just like the future itself. Collected for this unique book, the designs viewed in retrospect reveal the mindset of a unique period in history. In addition to an extensive selection of drawings are historical black and white photographs of actual shops built in a similar style. Shop America offers a rare look at mid-century commercial America as it pictured itself. The editor: Jim Heimann is Executive Editor for TASCHEN America in Los Angeles and the author of numerous books on architecture, popular culture, and Hollywood history including TASCHEN's bestselling All-American Ads series. The author: Steven Heller, the art director of the New York Times Book Review and co-chair of the School of Visual Arts MFA Design program, is the author of over one hundred books on design, popular culture, and satiric art. In addition to writing for over a dozen TASCHEN titles, his recent books include Design Literacy Second Edition, Stylepedia, and The Education of a Graphic Designer.	2007	Taschen						ZZZ000000

These are interiors created by people who shop in Colette in Paris, live on the Lower East Side in New York and travel to Tokyo. The domestic spaces are often DIY and strongly reflect pop culture.  Filled with post-modern pop collectables, vintage junk finds, camouflage and graffiti, clothing and toy collections, contemporary art resting in bookshelves and crammed onto walls, these homes are an antidote to the sterility of minimalism.  Looking at these interiors city by city, among the 30 homes featured in the book are those of artist and designer Julie Verhoeven and Maharishi founder Hardy Blechmann in London, graffiti artist Fafi in Paris, artists Ryan McGinness and Wes Lang in New York, innovative creatives Jaybo and Lucio Auri in Berlin, Barcelona filmmaker Roger Gual, and Tokyo's cult photographer Yasumasa Yonehara and artist Aya Takano.

9780500513149	Advertising is dead,long live advertising!	Tom Himpe		The first overview of the revolutionary advertising techniques and media needed to successfully reach today's consumer. Twenty years ago an advertiser could reach eighty percent of the American population with just three television commercials. Today it takes 150. Advertising is suffering because of the sheer amount of it, the lack of innovation within traditional advertising formats, and the power that media fragmentation and technology give to consumers to tune out the noise. The new buzzwords are guerrilla, stealth, ambush, buzz, viral, grassroots, wildfire, and ambient. This book is the first to harness them into an integrated communications approach, as Tom Himpe explains and illustrates: • the four driving forces for getting close to the consumer: be personal; go where the competition isn't; make the brand invisible; be unpredictable; • the eight techniques—from consumer involvement to harnessing the power of the senses—for employing these driving forces, illustrated with campaigns from across the world; • the four types of campaign that make use of this new knowledge. 435 color illustrations.	2006-10-17	Thames & Hudson						ZZZ000000

Bernstein&Donna Warner		A hot real estate market and ever-escalating prices often force homebuyers into settling for second or third best. Sometimes view trumps structure, or it's a case of worst-house-on-the-block syndrome. Whatever the reason for decorating despair, Renovate proves that even the drabbest digs can find new life. From a minimalist Chicago loft to a cozy Pasadena bungalow, these 30 diverse homes all share a common thread: all were lackluster dwellings that have re-emerged as fabulous places to live. Featuring 200 color photographs, each makeover, from the highly practical to the purely aesthetic, is well illustrated with before and after photos, and most include floor plans. Divided into style-specific chapters, including cottages, ranch house, apartments, and suburban homes, the book presents homeowners with a wealth of helpful, easily implemented design lessons and provides creative solutions to renovation problems. Also features contact information for architects, designers, furniture manufacturers, and craftspeople for every major region of the country.	2004-10-01	Filipacchi Publishing						ZZZ000000

9780316154987	Us and them,understanding your tribal mind	David Berreby		Fifty years ago, Wall Street was not what it is today. It was a hodge-podge of companies-hundreds of them-operating in an environment where high-tech meant an electric typewriter and the Wasps and Jews never mixed. Today, Wall Street is controlled by a few massive firms and, it often seems, few ethical constraints. The tale of Wall Street's rise and transformation is one of the most exciting and important of our time. But amazingly, never before have the players who saw everything-large and small, from tycoons in limousines to the barber in the basement of the stock exchange-directly told their stories. Here, at long last, are the Masters of the Universe and the con men; the backroom geniuses and the power-tie billionaires-all in first person, uncensored, brash, bold, and often not so fond of one another. The result is the most vibrant business history published in years, perfect for anyone who wishes they had been a fly on the boardroom wall.	2005	Little, Brown and Co.						ZZZ000000
9780761128625	How to make someone love you forever!,in 90 minutes or less	Nicholas Boothman		It's time to stop leaving love to chance. Time to stop being too shy to meet someone, wondering why a promising first date wound up going nowhere, or realizing too late that it happened with the wrong person anyway. Nicholas Boothman has a much better way.  Drawing on his expertise in Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP), Boothman charts a three-step plan that will help anyone find the love of his or her life. Step one: get ready—come to know who you are through honest self-assessment, and then to know what type of person is your matched opposite—i.e., the person who completes you. Step two, the heart of the program, is working seriously on interpersonal skills—how to be charming, not alarming; flirt with confidence; synchronize body and voice to create trust and chemistry; keep enthusiasm high; even how to cast a wide social net and dress for a first meeting.  Step three is about accelerating the kind of intimacy that leads to love, by finding "Me too!" triggers and mastering the art of incidental touch. You'll learn to tap into key emotions through low-, medium-, and high-risk disclosures—and how to intensify the nonverbal signals that turn sparks into a flame. All the while you'll establish a solid romantic foundation to convert this magic 90 minutes into a lifetime of love and commitment.	2004-04-03	Workman Pub.						ZZZ000000
9780761140733	Younger Next Year for Women	Chris Crowley&Henry S. Lodge		You're coming into the peak of your life. And because you’re already more attuned to your physical and emotional needs, and more inclined to commit to a healthier lifestyle, you're poised to live brilliantly for the thirty-plus years after menopause. All you need now is the program outlined in Younger Next Year for Women—which, for starters, will help you avoid literally 70 percent of the decay and eliminate 50 percent of the injuries and illnesses associated with getting older.   How? Drawn from disciplines as varied as evolutionary biology, cell physiology, experimental psychology and anthropology, the science behind Younger Next Year is clear. Our bodies are programmed to do one of two things: either grow or decay. Sitting in front of a screen all day tells the body to decay. Taking a walk or doing yoga tells the body to grow. Loneliness and stress trigger decay; love and laughter trigger growth.   Just as clear as the science is the goal: Become the active gatekeeper of your own body and gain the power to control those signals of growth and decay. Seven simple rules show the way, from #1 Exercise six days a week for the rest of your life, to #6 Care, to #7 Connect and commit.   You're coming into the peak of your life.

Seven simple rules show the way, from #1 Exercise six days a week for the rest of your life, to #6 Care, to #7 Connect and commit.   They’re called Harry’s Rules, named for the doctor and coauthor—Henry S. Lodge, M.D.—who formulated them, and who explains the precise science behind each one. But since it’s one thing to know something’s good for you and quite another to put it into practice, Dr. Lodge, the scientist, is joined by Chris Crowley—coauthor, exhorter and living example—whose brusque charm and infectious enthusiasm will actually have you living by the rules. So, congratulations. You’re now about to get younger.	2005-10-04	Workman Pub.						ZZZ000000

9780330411684	The Secret of Crickley Hall	James Herbert		The Caleighs have had a terrible year... They need time and space, while they await the news they dread. Gabe has brought his wife, Eve, and daughters, Loren and Cally, down to Devon, to the peaceful seaside village of Hollow Bay. He can work and Eve and the kids can have some peace and quiet and perhaps they can try, as a family, to come to terms with what's happened to them... Crickley Hall is an unusually large house on the outskirts of the village at the bottom of Devil's Cleave, a massive tree-lined gorge - the stuff of local legend. A river flows past the front garden. It's perfect for them... if a bit gloomy. And Chester, their dog, seems really spooked at being away from home. And old houses do make sounds. And it's constantly cold. And even though they shut the cellar door every night, it's always open again in morning'Ś The Secret of Crickley Hall is James Herbert's finest novel to date. It explores the darker, more obtuse territories of evil and the supernatural. With brooding menace and rising tension, he masterfully and relentlessly draws the reader through to the ultimate revelation ' one that will stay to chill the mind long after the book has been laid aside.	2007-05-04	Pan Macmillan						ZZZ000000

One was born to a life of prosperity and ease, the other to a world of hardship and struggle. On different sides of the globe, they grew up— one shaped by a luxurious upbringing, fine schools, and a history he read; the other well tempered by war, slavery, and the history he was part of. William Lowell Kane, scion of a Boston banking family, and Abel Rosnovski, penniless Polish immigrant — one is gold, the other steel. Rosnovski is Kane's ultimate adversary, while Kane embodies everything that Rosnovski stands against. In their relentless battle, both men know that there can be only one victor— and one vanquished.	2003-07-04	Pan						ZZZ000000

9780330412605	Scission	Tim Winton		'Tim Winton is the real thing: a writer who can photograph a thought and pluck out the beat of a soul on a washing line' Scotland on Sunday In this, Tim Winton's first collection of short stories, the world he paints is often harsh and disturbing, inhabited by isolated, unforgiving characters. It is a world at once familiar, filled with the trappings of home and family, and yet also strangely twisted; a world where casual brutality and unexpected death are never far from the surface. Evident in a young girl's violent temper once the eggs she has so jealously guarded finally hatch, or in the careless indifference of the woman stepping over a soldier's spreadeagled body, Tim Winton's world is a place where dysfunction and disorder constantly threaten the equilibrium. But there is compassion and beauty there too ' whether it's in the brush of a father's hand against his young son's cheek, or the neighbours who wait patiently to celebrate the arrival of a new baby. 'Winton is boisterous and lyrical by turns; his sense of sentiment is unerringly accurate, his characters unforgettable. The emotional control exercised over his anarchic world puts Winton in the top drawer of Australian fiction' Daily Telegraph 'Winton's compassionate and humorous writing is nothing short of magnificent.

9780330478861	Twisted Metal	Tony Ballantyne		On a world of intelligent robots who seem to have forgotten their own distant past, it is a time of war as the soldiers of Artemis City set out to conquer everything within range on the continent of Shull, killing or converting every robot they capture to their philosophy, while viewing their own wire-based minds as nothing but metal to be used or recycled for the cause. Elsewhere, the more individualistic robots of Turing City believe they are something more than metal, but when the Artemisian robot Kavan sets out on a determined crusade to prove himself, even Turing City can't stand against him. Increasingly tied up with Kavan's destiny is Karel, a Turing robot with elements of Artemis's philosophy already woven into his mind '¦ as well as Karel's wife Susan, and their recently created child.. Following the inevitable violence and destruction, Artemisian ambition focuses elsewhere and a journey begins towards the frozen kingdoms of the north '¦ and towards the truth about the legendary 'Book of Robots', a text which may finally explain the real history of this strange world '¦ In a completely alien but brilliantly realized landscape, here is a powerful story of superb action, barbaric cruelty and intense emotional impact.	2010	Pan Macmillan						ZZZ000000

Twenty years ago, a mysterious group called the Butteri committed a series of bizarre crimes evoking the lost race of the Etruscans, and leaving in their wake a several bodies, a cryptic message, and a kidnapped child. Now, the leaders of the G8 are descending on Rome for a summit at the Quirinale Palace. But when a politician is found ritually murdered, seemingly by a strange young man dressed as the Etruscan blue demon, detective Nic Costa suspects that the old case was never really solved.

9780099542162	Inherent Vice	Thomas Pynchon		Part noir, part psychedelic romp, all Thomas Pynchon u private eye Doc Sportello comes, occasionally, out of a marijuana haze to watch the end of an era as free love slips away and paranoia creeps in with the L.A. fog. It's been awhile since Doc Sportello has seen his ex-girlfriend. Suddenly out of nowhere she shows up with a story about a plot to kidnap a billionaire land developer whom she just happens to be in love with. Easy for her to say. It's the tail end of the psychedelic sixties in L.A., and Doc knows that 'love' is another of those words going around at the moment, like 'trip' or 'groovy', except that this one usually leads to trouble. Despite which he soon finds himself drawn into a bizarre tangle of motives and passions whose cast of characters includes surfers, hustlers, dopers and rockers, a murderous loan shark, a tenor sax player working undercover, an ex-con with a swastika tattoo and a fondness for Ethel Merman, and a mysterious entity known as the Golden Fang, which may only be a tax dodge set up by some dentists. In this lively yarn, Thomas Pynchon, working in an unaccustomed genre, provides a classic illustration of the principle that if you can remember the sixties, you weren't there...or...if you were there, then you...or, wait, is it...	2010	Random House						ZZZ000000

A place of foreboding, its smell is of death…But elsewhere, agents of a far greater conflict have made their opening moves. The Crippled God has been granted a place in the pantheon, a schism threatens and sides must be chosen. Whatever each god decides, the ground rules have changed, irrevocably, terrifyingly, and the first blood spilled will be in the mortal world. A world which contains ahost of characters, familiar and new, including Heboric Ghost Hands, the god-possessed Apsalar, Cutter, once a thief now a killer, the extraordinary warrior called Karsa Orlong and the two wanderers Icarium and Mappo — each searching for such a fate as they might fashion with their own hands, guided by their own will. If only the gods would leave them alone.But now that knives have been unsheathed, the gods are disinclined to be kind. There shall be war, war in the heavens. And the prize? Nothing less than existence itself … Here is the stunning new chapter in Steven Erikson’s magnificent Malazan Book of the Fallen — hailed as an epic of the imagination and acknowledged as a fantasy classic in the making.	2007	Bantam Books						ZZZ000000

9780091797263	The Alastair Campbell Diaries, Volume One,Prelude to Power, 1947-1997, The Complete Edition	Alastair Campbell		As Alastair Campbell said in the introduction to The Blair Years, it was always his intention to publish the full version, covering his time as spokesman and chief strategist to Tony Blair. Prelude to Power is the first of four volumes, and covers the early days of New Labour, culminating in their victory at the polls in 1997. Volume 1 details the extraordinary tensions between Tony Blair and Gordon Brown as they resolved the question as to which one should stand to become Labour leader. It shows that right from the start, relations at the top were prone to enormous strain, suspicions and accusations of betrayal. Yet it also shows the political and personal bonds that tied them together, and which made them one of the most feared and respected electoral machines anywhere in the world. A story of politics in the raw, Prelude to Power is above all an intimate, detailed portrait of the people who have done so much to shape modern history.	2010	Random House UK						ZZZ000000

9780552775496	The Spiders of Allah	James Hider		The bloodshed perpetrated in the name of religion in the world today is nowhere more obvious than in the Middle East. Whether we are talking about hardcore Zionist settlers still fighting ancient Biblical battles in the hills of the West Bank or Shiite death squads roaming the lawless streets of Iraq in the aftermath of Saddam; whether it's the misappropriation and martyrdom of Mickey Mouse by Gaza s Islamists, or a US president acting on God s orders, James Hider sees the hallucinatory effect of what he calls the 'crack cocaine of fanatical fundamentalism' all around him. As James Hider travels around the Middle East, from Israel to Gaza, to Iraq 苔nd then back to Jerusalem, he takes his doubts about religious beliefs to the very heart of the world's holy wars. He meets terrorists and their victims, soldiers and clerics, ordinary people and extraordinary people. The question in the back of his mind is: how can people not only believe in all this madness, but die and kill for it too? This timely book casts an unflinching yet compassionate eye on the very worst and most violent crimes committed in the name of religion and asks questions that the world needs to answer if we are to stand a chance of facing our own worst demons.	2010-01-14	Black Swan						ZZZ000000

Love, despite everything, e Julia and Valentina Poole are normal American teenagers normal, at least, for identical mirror twins who have no interest in college or jobs or possibly anything outside their cozy suburban home. But everything changes when they receive notice that an aunt whom they didn t know existed has died and left them her flat in an apartment block overlooking Highgate Cemetery in London. They feel that at last their own lives can begin ... but have no idea that they ve been summoned into a tangle of fraying lives, from the obsessive-compulsive crossword setter who lives above them to their aunt s mysterious and elusive lover who lives below them, and even to their aunt herself, who never got over her estrangement from the twins mother and who can t even seem to quite leave her flat.... With Highgate Cemetery itself a character and echoes of Henry James and Charles Dickens, HER FEARFUL SYMMETRY is a delicious and deadly twenty-first-century ghost story about Niffenegger s familiar themes of love, loss and identity. It is certain to cement her standing as one of the most singular and remarkable novelists of our time.	2009-10	Jonathan Cape						ZZZ000000

A middle-aged couple who supplied statues to his father, Geminus, have disappeared in mysterious circumstances. They had an old feud with a bunch of notorious freedmen, the Claudii, who live rough in the pestilential Pontine Marshes, terrorising the neighbourhood. When a mutilated corpse turns up near Rome, Falco and his vigiles friend Petronius investigate, even though it means travelling in the dread marshes. But just as they are making progress, the Chief Spy, Anacrites, snatches their case away from them. As his rivalry with Falco escalates, he makes false overtures of friendship, but fails to cover up the fact that the violent Claudii have acquired corrupt protection at the highest level. Making further enquiries after they have been warned off can only be dangerous -- but when did that stop Falco and Petronius? Egged on by the slippery bureaucrats who hate Anacrites, the dogged friends dig deeper while a psychotic killer keeps taking more victims, and the shocking truth creeps closer and closer to home.

9780099516446	Sushi and Beyond,What the Japanese Know about Cooking	Michael Booth		Japan is the pre-eminent food nation on earth. The Japanese go to the most extraordinary lengths and expense to eat the finest, most delectable, and downright freakiest food imaginable. Their creativity, dedication and ingenuity, not to mention courage in the face of dishes such as cod sperm, whale penis and octopus ice cream, is only now beginning to be fully appreciated in the sushi-saturated West, as are the remarkable health benefits of the traditional Japanese diet. Inspired by Shizuo Tsuji s classic book, Japanese Cooking, A Simple Art, food and travel writer Michael Booth sets off to take the culinary pulse of contemporary Japan, learning fascinating tips and recipes that few westerners have been privy to before. Accompanied by with two fussy eaters under the age of six, he and his wife travel the length of the country, from bear-infested, beer-loving Hokkaido to snake-infested, seaweed-loving Okinawa. Along the way, they dine with - and score a surprising victory over - sumos; meet the indigenous Ainu; drink coffee at the dog café; pamper the world s most expensive cows with massage and beer; discover the secret of the Okinawan people s remarkable longevity; share a seaside lunch with free-diving, female abalone hunters; and meet the greatest chefs working in Japan today. Less happily, they trash a Zen garden, witness a mass fugu slaughter, are traumatised by an encounter with giant crabs, and attempt a calamitous cooking demonstration for the lunching ladies of Kyoto. They also ask, Who are you? to the most famous TV stars in Japan. What do the Japanese know about food? Perhaps more than anyone on else on earth, judging by this fascinating and funny journey through an extraordinary food-obsessed country.	2010-07-01	Random House						ZZZ000000

Or that seeking to be nice and agreeable on a date is not actually the most attractive strategy.

Professor Persaud will also, for the first time, reveal research findings that show it is possible to guess your IQ from the way you look.	2007-01-01	Bantam Press						ZZZ000000
