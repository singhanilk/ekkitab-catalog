9780349118871	El Sid	Chris Haslam		Mark Timlin, INDEPENDENT, Crime Books of the Year: 'Chris Haslam's latest novel, EL SID is a classic case of the biter bit, as small-time criminal Lenny Knowles, stupid but convinced that his intellect is the equal of anyone's, meets Spanish civil war veteran Sidney Starman, aka El Sid, who claims he knows the whereabouts of a stash of hidden Republican gold. Lenny, Sid and Lenny's ex-cell mate Nick Crick set off to liberate the treasure and live happily ever after. No chance. The story cuts back and forth between the present and the past as Sid relates stories of the war, and the trio rage around Spain getting deeper into trouble every day, until a terrific climax where Lenny discovers he's not half as smart as the old soldier.' Chris Haslam's third novel is the first not to feature his petty criminal but generally well-meaning anti-hero Martin Brock. But everything that reviewers and readers loved about his first two books is to be found here: compelling plotting, unforgettable characters, a brilliant comic touch. EL SID also offers a touching portrait of an old man in search of redemption.	2007-09-06	ABACUS						FIC022000

9780374278212	The Great Fire,A Novel	Shirley Hazzard		The year is 1947. The great fire of the Second World War has convulsed Europe and Asia. In its wake, Aldred Leith, an acclaimed hero of the conflict, has spent two years in China at work on an account of world-transforming change there. Son of a famed and sexually ruthless novelist, Leith begins to resist his own self-sufficiency nurtured by war. Peter Exley, another veteran and an art historian by training, is prosecuting war crimes committed by the Japanese. Both men have narrowly escaped death in battle, and Leith saved Exley's life. The men have maintained long-distance friendship in a postwar loneliness that haunts them both, and which has swallowed Exley whole. Now in their thirties, with their youth behind them and their world in ruins, both must invent the future and retrieve a private humanity. Arriving in Occupied Japan to record the effects of the bomb in Hiroshima, Leith meets Benedict and Helen Driscoll, the Australian son and daughter of a tyrannical medical administrator. Benedict, at twenty, is doomed by a rare degenerative disease. Helen, still younger, is inseparable from her brother. Precocious, brilliant, sensitive, at home in the books they read together, these two have been, in Leith's words, delivered by literature. The young people capture Leith's sympathy; indeed, he finds himself struggling with his attraction to this girl whose feelings are as intense as his own and from whom he will soon be fatefully parted. A deeply observed story of love and separation, of disillusion and recovered humanity, "The Great Fire" marks the much-awaited return to fiction of an author whose novel "The Transit of Venus" won the National Book Critics Circle Award and, twenty years after its publication, is considered a modern classic. Shirley Hazzard was born in Australia, and in early years traveled the world with her parents due to their diplomatic postings. At sixteen, living in Hong Kong, she was engaged by British Intelligence, where, in 1947-48, she was involved in monitoring the civil war in China. Thereafter, she lived in New Zealand and in Europe; in the United States, where she worked for the United Nations Secretariat in New York; and in Italy. In 1963, she married the writer Francis Steegmuller, who died in 1994. Ms. Hazzard's previous novels are "The Evening of the Holiday"dn0 (1966), "The Bay of Noon" (1970), and "The Transit of Venus" (1981). She is also the author of two collections of short fiction, "Cliffs of Fall and Other Stories" (1963) and "People in Glass Houses "(1967). Her nonfiction works include "Defeat of an Ideal "(1973), "Countenance of Truth" (1990), and the memoir" Greene on Capri "(2000). She lives in New York, with sojourns in Italy.	2003-10-15	Farrar, Straus and Giroux						ZZZ000000

The change is like a cool breeze across a pond on a blistering summer day.Spot the Frog is the first collection of Mark Heath's charming new comic strip. Through its pages readers meet Spot, an amiable little amphibian; grandfatherly Karl, Spot's favorite two-legged mammal; and Buddy, a bespectacled fellow-frog who is Spot's best pal. This trio finds its way in and out of life's challenges and joys, never needing more than each other and their immediate surroundings to generate plenty of laughs and lighter views of the world at large.Spot the Frog is a tribute to Heath's originality, his beautifully rendered characters, and the artist-writer's ability to successfully swim against the stream.	2006-04-01	Andrews McMeel Publishing						ZZZ000000

9780970064585	Anita's Legacy,An Inquiry Into First Cause	Gurpur M. Prabhu		At some point in our lives, The Question of First Cause: Why is there something instead of nothing? occurs to all of us. In our quest for The Answer we are swayed into accepting opinions from specialists in the traditional camps of organized religion & organized science. Both camps, of course, have been successful in promulgating their own myths. In this visionary fiction book, Gurpur M. Prabhu puts these myths into perspective by leading us through a critical examination of world religions, philosophies & scientific methods. Profound links & parallel concepts are revealed between religious literature & cosmology. What emerges is a model of the universe, an incisive critique of the nature of science & religion, informative commentary on philosophy & history & an inspirational lesson in transcending religious boundaries instead of being dogmatic about one's own faith being superior to others. With the ever-widening breach between religion & science the goal is to unite the disciplines rather than propagate the dichotomy. The provocative, humorous & spiritually uplifting theme grips the reader from start to finish.

9780566077371	The new guide to identity,how to create and sustain change through managing identity	Wolff Olins		It is, of course, commonplace for corporations to operate sophisticated identity programmes. But identity has now moved way beyond the commercial area. We live in a world in which cities, charities, universities, clubs - in fact any activity that involves more than two or three people - all seem to have identities too. However, very few of these organizations have released the full potential that effective management of identity can achieve.In this book, the world's leading authority on corporate identity shows how managing identity can create and sustain behavioural change in an organization as well as achieving the more traditional outcome of influencing its external audiences.The New Guide to Identity provides a simple clear guide to identity, including what it is and how it can be used to full effect. If a change of identity is required, the whole process is described from start-up (including investigation and analysis of the current identity), through developing the new identity structure, to implementation and launch. For anyone responsible for the identity of an organization, or for designing it for someone else, or attempting to achieve change in their organization, or studying the subject, this straightforward guide is essential reading.	1995	Design Council/Gower						ZZZ000000
9780754609520	Chinese science and technology industrial parks	Susan M. Walcott		This book examines types of advanced technology Chinese districts set aside for developing products for national and global markets. Of particular interest is their function in transferring innovative knowledge. Theories of corporate clusters are presented and compared to the Chinese situation. Case studies explore the role of park policies in accelerating economic growth in China, as well as the major steps in China's business development since 1978. Regional variations are explored in six locations, from Xi'an in the west to Beijing in the north, Suzhou-Shanghai on the east coast and Shenzhen-Dongguan in the southeast. The difference between zones concerned with promoting multinational corporations and those encouraging ties to local research forms a key distinction. The book culminates in a proposed best practice model for Chinese integration into global networks, based on China's own particular political economy.	2003	Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.						ZZZ000000

9780566081071	On design and innovation,a selection of lectures	Royal Society of Arts (Great Britain)		With the right collaborative and supportive structures, the skills and ideas of craftspeople, designers, innovators and scientific researchers can work together to strengthen industry and improve its products. This selection of RSA lectures, which represents the whole creative spectrum from craft and design to scientific invention, describes how this can be done and how these different groups have worked with industry in different ways.Sir Nicholas Goodison's lecture emphasizes the value of craft skills for industry and outlines ways in which manufacturers can be encouraged to use them more; developing this theme, Robin Levien explains the difference between craft and design skills and how manufacturers can mass produce 'craft magic' to make their products more appealing. The next three lectures show what it is really like to set up creative enterprises (Helen David English Eccentrics, Tomato and Priestman Goode) and stick to one's ideals in the business context. In his lecture about ship container design, naval architect Marshall Meek, Master of the RSA's Faculty of Royal Designers for Industry, describes the realities of working with major shipbuilding companies, balancing the different demands of safety, function and cost, often challenging convention. The last three lectures in the book focus on scientific research and technological invention. Professor Sir Alec Broers argues that research can no longer be carried out in isolation from the worldwide research network: small groups must collaborate with larger organizations to ensure survival and success - a view echoed in Simon Schaffer's analysis of the decline (and success) of science, and its social and political context. Sir Robert May suggests how the UK's world-class science and engineering base can be better exploited for economic advantage through government and other initiatives so that individual researchers receive proper reward and so that we 'capture the creativity of both individuals and of business'.This book offers valuable insight into business and industrial practice for craftspeople and designers, for manufacturers who work with them and for students intending to set up their own companies. Scientific researchers will find in it ideas for developing and funding their work. It will also be of interest to academics working in the fields of innovation, technology management and craft/design education.	1999-06	Gower						ZZZ000000

Khan - a young Pakistani nuclear scientist working in Holland - stole top secret blueprints for a revolutionary new process to arm a nuclear bomb. His original intention was to provide for Pakistan a counter to India's ongoing pursuit of an atomic bomb. But over time that ambition mushroomed into a vast nuclear black market sanctioned by Pakistan's military elite - financed by aid money from the United States, Saudi Arabia and Libya, as well as boundless assistance from China. They secretly sold weapons to Iran, North Korea, and many others - with the clear knowledge of the American government, for whom Pakistan was a crucial buffer against the Soviets and now an ally in the 'war on terror'. Successive US administrations conducted a deliberate cover-up: destroying intelligence, lying to Congress and the West about Pakistan's capability, and facilitating the spread of the very weapons we vilify the 'axis of evil' powers for coveting and dread Islamic terrorists obtaining.	2007-01	Atlantic						ZZZ000000

Now, Duncan McLaren offers lapsed devotees the possibility of honest redemption.

9781846270376	28,Stories of AIDS in Africa	Stephanie Nolen		From one of our most widely read, award-winning journalists - comes the powerful, unputdownable story of the very human cost of a global pandemic of staggering scope and scale. It is essential reading for our times. In 28, Stephanie Nolen, the Globe and Mail' s Africa Bureau Chief, puts a human face to the crisis created by HIV-AIDS in Africa. She has achieved, in this amazing book, something extraordinary: she writes with a power, understanding and simplicity that makes us listen, makes us understand and care. Through riveting anecdotal stories - one for each of the million people living with HIV-AIDS in Africa - Nolen explores the effects of an epidemic that well exceeds the Black Plague in magnitude. It is a calamity that is unfolding just a 747-flight away, and one that will take the lives of these 28 million without the help of massive, immediate intervention on an unprecedented scale. 28 is a timely, transformative, thoroughly accessible book that shows us definitively why we continue to ignore the growth of HIV-AIDS in Africa only at our peril and at an intolerable moral cost. 28' s stories are much more than a record of the suffering and loss in 28 emblematic lives. Here we meet women and men fighting vigorously on the frontlines of disease: Tigist Haile Michael, a smart, shy 14-year-old Ethiopian orphan fending for herself and her baby brother on the slum streets of Addis Ababa; Alice Kadzanja, an HIV-positive nurse in Malawi, where one in six adults has the virus, and where the average adult' s life expectancy is 36; and Zackie Achmat, the hero of South Africa' s politically fragmented battle against HIV-AIDS. 28 also tellsus how the virus works, spreads and, ultimately, kills. It explains the connection of HIV-AIDS to conflict, famine and the collapse of states; shows us how easily treatment works for those lucky enough to get it and details the struggles of those who fight to stay alive with little support. It makes vivid the strong, desperate people doing all they can, and maintaining courage, dignity and hope against insurmountable odds. It is - in its humanity, beauty and sorrow - a call to action for all who read it. "From the Hardcover edition."	2007-05-28	Portobello Books						ZZZ000000

9781843547242	God and gold,Britain, America, and the making of the modern world	Walter Russell Mead		In God and Gold, Walter Russell Mead argues that the most important story in world history in the last 400 years is the birth, rise and dominance of a global political and economic system resting first on the power of Britain and now on the United States. God and Gold explores why that system rose to dominate the world and where the first truly global system of culture, politics, production and trade ever seen is taking us. Beginning with an account of the 300 years war with Spain, France, Germany, Japan and the Soviet Union - WASP wars, as Mead calls them - Mead looks at the ideology as well as the power politics of Anglo-American history, framing it in the larger context of world history to explain the how English and American culture turned out to be uniquely adapted to capitalism and how those who have opposed them, from the time of Louis XIV to the present day, have developed a bitter critique of the Anglo-American world.	2008	Atlantic Books, Limited						ZZZ000000

From 9/11 conspiracy theories to Holocaust denial, creationism to alternative medicine, we are all experiencing an epidemic of demonstrably untrue descriptions of the world. For Damian Thompson, these unproven theories and spurious claims are forms of 'counterknowledge', and, helped by the internet, they are creating a global generation of misguided adherents who repeat these untruths and lend them credence. 'The sleep of reason brings forth monsters', warns the title of Francisco Goya's famous etching of 1799.

9781845133481	A Thing of Unspeakable Horror,The History of Hammer Films	Sinclair McKay		**** 'This 50th anniversary celebration will have fang fans revelling in its chatty, perceptive prose.' Metro Hammer Films was in business producing its unique brand of camp Gothic horror films from 1934 until 1979, and struck gold in 1957 with The Curse of Frankenstein. If the "Carry On" films established a thoroughly British brand of lewd innuendo and slapstick comedy, Hammer established an equally British brand of lashings of fake gore, heaving d_colletage and plots as creaky as the sets (the Transylvanian mansion was actually a country house in Berkshire) and. Hammer made stars out of regulars like Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing, and it gave early screen roles to an unlikely crop of thespians from Denis Waterman to Kate O'Mara. In 2007 the Hammer oeuvre was reissued on DVD - but, as he author makes clear, the true medium for these trashy gorefests is late night TV after you've got back from the pub. Sinclair McKay has written an often hilarious history of Hammer entirely in the spirit of the films - unafraid to award Dracula Has Risen from the Grave the ultimate accolade of "the drunk person's Citizen Kane", or to compare the worst sets of Dracula's castle to a branch of the Aberdeen Steak House. Sinclair McKay was formerly Deputy Features Editor of the Daily Telegraph. He is now writing a history of the Bond films for Aurum.	2008-06-01	Aurum Press, Limited						ZZZ000000

Now, those conversations are collected in book form, revealing his development from joke writer to stand-up comedian to world-famous film-maker. Allen talks about the seeds of his ideas and the writing of his screenplays; about casting and acting, shooting and directing, editing and scoring. He describes his problems casting American men, and explains why he admires the acting of (among many others) Alan Alda, Marlon Brando, Michael Caine, Robert De Niro, Leonardo Di Caprio, Mia Farrow, Gene Hackman, Scarlett Johansson, Jack Nicholson and Charlize Theron. He discusses his favourite films (Citizen Kane the only American movie among his top ten, Duck Soup and Airplane two of his preferred 'comedian's films'), and what he appreciates about directors like Bergman, Fellini, Kurosawa, John Huston and Jean Renoir. Throughout, he shows himself to be thoughtful, honest, witty, self-deprecating and often hilarious. Conversations with Woody Allen is essential reading for everyone interested in the art of movie-making and for everyone who has ever enjoyed a Woody Allen film.	2008	Aurum						ZZZ000000
9781845133887	Didier Drogba,The Autobiography	Didier Drogba		"Born in the West African country of Ivory Coast, Drogba tells of his heartbreaking separation from his homeland at the age of five, and his unsettled formative years moving around France before early breaks at Le Mans and Guingamp revealed a precocious talent stunningly confirmed in his first season with Marseille. A subsequent [pound]23.8m move to Chelsea saw him pivotal in Chelsea's first league title in 50 years and the start of a dazzling haul of silverware." "Then in September 2007 Mourinho, the manager who had melded this fabulously expensive collection of international superstars into a team of champions, left Chelsea, and for a while it looked as though Drogba would go too. Although the rest of the season would see him continue scoring goals under Avram Grant, taking Chelsea to the brink of Champions League triumph in Moscow, doubts over his future in English football persisted." "But there is much more to Didier Drogba. A committed humanitarian and peace campaigner, he now travels the world as a Goodwill Ambassador for the United Nations. And in Ivory Coast he is a national hero, having captained 'The Elephants' to their first ever World Cup in 2006, and the African Cup of Nations final the same year. His fame there has inspired dance crazes and place names - and above all has been a crucial unifying influence after years of bitter civil war."--BOOK JACKET.	2008-07-01	Aurum Press, Limited						ZZZ000000
9781845133399	Arsene Wenger,The Biography	Xavier Rivoire		'...a well organised, entertaining book and the perfect gift for all Arsenal fans' Ernest Hecht, Observer Sports Monthly Arsene Wenger is credited with revolutionising one of the biggest clubs in Europe - famously bringing free-flowing football to 'boring, boring Arsenal' - and with influencing approaches to the modern game. In an industry of disposable contracts and ruthless sacking, his twelve year tenure is testament to his success and dedication, and to the loyalty of players and fans. Wenger has said he is far too young to write his autobiography. Instead, he has cooperated with leading sports journalist Xavier Rivoire in this new authorised and definitive biography, which includes exclusive interviews with Wenger, ex and current players, family, colleagues and observers, across Japan, France and England. The result is a highly readable portrait of an astute and incisive manager, a shrewd talent scout and man manager, as well as an intensely private and intriguing man. 'Insightful ... a useful guide to what makes the idiosyncratic Wenger tick.

9781845133429	Walt Disney,The Biography	Neal Gabler		His classic films illuminated everyone's childhood. The theme parks are on every tourist itinerary. The movie empire is one of Hollywood's biggest players. Walt Disney is one of the few men who unquestionably changed our culture. Neal Gabler is the first author to have had complete access to the Disney Archives, enabling him to write the definitive biography of this remarkable man. It's a long book, as Disney's achievement was so huge, but a truly compulsive read. He shows how Disney built up his fledgling studio with short cartoons featuring Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck, before quite simply reinventing animation with full-length films like Snow White, Pinocchio, Bambi and Dumbo. An astounding amount of work went into a film like Fantasia, with whole crews working round the clock on a sequence a couple of minutes long - only for the obsessively perfectionist Disney to order it re-done. Walt's profligacy and expansionism meant it was brother and business partner Roy who kept the company solvent. Disney then moved beyond animation with huge successes like Mary Poppins, and mixed utopianism and merchandising to conceive the world's first modern theme park, Disneyland. Gabler shows the dark side of Disney - ruthless towards long-serving staff, cavalier with contracts, neglectful of his family - but also the vulnerability, born of loneliness and ill health, in an admirably balanced portrait. Neal Gabler writes for The New York Times and the Los Angeles Times. He is currently a senior fellow at the Norman Lear Center for the Study of Entertainment and Society at the University of Southern California. His other books include An Empire of Their Own and Life, the Movie. He lives in Amagansett, New York.	2008-05	Aurum						ZZZ000000

9781560258520	Iraq confidential,the untold story of the intelligence conspiracy to undermine the UN and overthrow Saddam Hussein	Scott Ritter		Scott Ritter is the straight-talking former marine officer who the CIA wants to silence. After the 1991 Gulf War, Ritter helped lead the UN weapons inspections of Iraq and found himself at the center of a dangerous game between the Iraqi and US regimes. As Ritter reveals in this explosive book, Washington was only interested in disarmament as a tool for its own agenda. Operating in a fog of espionage and counter-espionage, Ritter and his team were determined to find out the truth about Iraq's WMD. The CIA were equally determined to stop them. The truth, as we now know, was that Iraq was playing a deadly game of double-bluff, and actually had no WMD. But to have revealed this would have derailed America's drive for regime change. Iraq Confidential charts the disillusionment of a staunch patriot who came to realize that his own government sought to undermine effective arms control in the Middle East. Ritter shows us a world of deceit and betrayal in which nothing is as it seems. A host of characters from Mossad, MI6 and the CIA pepper this powerful narrative, which contains revelations that will permanently affect the ongoing debates about Iraq.	2005-10-05	Nation Books						ZZZ000000

9780786717835	Big pharma,exposing the global healthcare agenda	Jacky Law		Last year, the pharmaceutical industry had sales in excess of $300 billion. Clearly, we all pay in one way or another -- whether by buying drugs directly or through taxation. But it is less clear if we are getting value for our money. Author Jacky Law shows how a small number of corporations have come to dominate the global healthcare agenda. She reveals a system in which the relentless pursuit of profit is crowding out the public good. Effective regulators are under intense pressure from corporate lobbies, and companies spend more money on marketing than they spend on research and development. Meanwhile, the cost of new drugs rises relentlessly, while the number of original new products declines. All is not well with modern medicine. In what is both a diagnosis and a recommended course of treatment, Big Pharma reveals a world where market considerations, not medical need, are determining the research agenda. The author points to a future where the public and the medical profession once again have a voice in the kind of healthcare we want -- and the healthcare we pay for.	2006-02-26	Carroll & Graf						ZZZ000000
9781560258759	101 people who are really screwing America,(and Bernard Goldberg is only #73)	Jack Huberman		Perhaps one of the most ridiculous phenomena of recent years is Bernard Goldberg's right-wing and unforgivably successful 100 People Who Are Screwing Up America. The vast majority of his targets are no different from the picks of any hyperventilating fan of Rush Limbaugh and Bill O'Reilly: feminists, academics, media moguls, newspaper columnists, liberals, and a few obscure cartoonists and painters. But it's thin on the right wing politicos, their media and corporate echochamber who have landed us in the mess we're in. Best-selling author Jack Huberman provides us with an entertaining and informative bestiary of the real crooks, liars and cheats who are screwing up America. These are not just the people making asses of themselves or getting more media attention than they deserve. Huberman restores the likes of Fox News CEO Roger Ailes, James A. Baker III, Gary Bauer Brent Bozell, Ann Coulter, Karen Hughes, Karl Rove, Leo Strauss and Ralph Reed to their rightful place in the national hall of shame, along with such oozing pustules of cultural putrefaction as the Olson Twins, Mel Gibson, William Bennett, Katie Couric, Matt Drudge, Sean Hannity, Rush Limbaugh, Dr. Phil, Dr. Laura, Oprah Winfrey, Teletubbies, the Simpson sisters, and God.	2006-05-30	Nation Books						ZZZ000000
9781560258704	The Toxic Avenger	Lloyd Kaufman&Adam Jahnke		Over the past two decades, The Toxic Avenger has achieved the status of cult icon. Discerning fans around the world have followed "Toxie's" adventures through four films, an animated feature, a Saturday-morning cartoon series, comic books, action figures, and more. His name has been used by everyone from the Environmental Protection Agency to the U.S. Army to PETA; he appears in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade; and his creator, Lloyd Kaufman, is claimed as an influence by directors like Peter Jackson and Quentin Tarantino. Now Kaufman has set aside his video camera and unleashed his twisted brilliance on the artistic form of Fitzgerald, Hemingway, Faulkner, and Mitch Albom. And to put it simply, Kaufman has blown those jokers out of the water. Readers who dare to crack the spine of this book will experience the gamut of human emotion (and then some): laughter, tears, and perhaps even vomiting and spontaneous ejaculation. With more girl-on-girl action than an episode of Springer, more blood-soaked bad taste than an After School Special, and with special "guest narrators" such as J. D. Salinger and Oliver Stone, The Toxic Avenger oozes hilarity on every page.	2006-04-19	Thunder's Mouth Press						ZZZ000000

9781568583358	The Message,100 Life Lessons from Hip-Hop's Greatest Songs	Felicia Pride		In this book of life lessons culled from hip-hop culture, author Felicia Pride examines a wide range of hip-hop songs and artists, interpreting life through their lenses. Growing up with hip-hop, Pride has come to realize the way it shaped how she thinks, writes, and reacts, making her the person she is today. By incorporating her own experiences and reflections with the rapper's message, she focuses on the positive, motivational influence hip-hop has on its audience. With each life lesson aptly titled after a hip-hop song, such as Kanye West's "Jesus Walks" or GangStarr's "Here Today, Gone Tomorrow," The Message explores spirituality, success, love, business, and more through hip-hop. Pride infuses these essential truths with examples from rappers' lives and music, providing positive reflections on hip-hop culture. For example, she tells you how to study how those with staying power, such as Missy Elliott and Russell Simmons, handle their business and how to incorporate similar tactics into your own life: be creative, diversify, handle your business. The Message shares the wisdom that Pride has learned from hip-hop, creating what is essentially a soundtrack to the hip-hopper's life.	2007-10-25	Thunder's Mouth Press						ZZZ000000

The Order of Crown, Shield, and Dragon, originally founded as Mordred's personal bodyguard, has become a legion of special agents for the Crown: special emissaries in time of peace, and invincible warriors in more violent times. They carry special weapons: swords, each of which contains the soul of someone of great power. White swords are inhabited by the souls of saints-and red swords by those who were anything but saints. Even in the hands of a knight of the Order, even wielded in the cause of righteousness, a red sword is terribly dangerous to its owner and all around him. In more evil hands, a red sword is the most dangerous and powerful weapon known to mankind. Now, three knights of the Order have just tracked down a previously unknown red sword which was found on a Grecian shore, and which shows all signs of having been recently forged. Worse, the mind encased in the sword remembers that it was only one of many which were cached in the hold of a mysterious sailing ship, origin unknown. . . .

Then he found out too much about a secret government project and he had the choice of disappearing or being recruited for the Prometheus Project. The Project was the largest disinformation operation in history, targeted at the aliens who ruled the galaxy. A mysterious individual known as Mr. Inconnu had arrived in a damaged but highly advanced craft in the 1940s with the information that he had escaped from a group of humans whom aliens had been studying. And unless the Earth could convince the aliens that the Earth had a unified government, and technology comparable to that of the galactic rulers, the Earth would be exploited as a primitive protectorate. So far the hoax was working-and the technology which Mr. Inconnu had brought with him helped-but someone in the Project was selling secrets to an interstellar mafia called the Tonkuztra about the real state of affairs on Earth. And Devaney knew that Chloe Bryant, the woman he had fallen in love with, was being set up to take a fall for the real traitor, who was about to embark on a treason whose consequences could jeopardize the very Universe. . . .

The Project was the largest disinformation operation in history, targeted at the aliens who ruled the galaxy. A mysterious individual known as Mr. Inconnu had arrived in a damaged but highly advanced craft in the 1940s with the information that he had escaped from a group of humans whom aliens had been studying. And unless the Earth could convince the aliens that the Earth had a unified government, and technology comparable to that of the galactic rulers, the Earth would be exploited as a primitive protectorate. So far the hoax was working-and the technology which Mr. Inconnu had brought with him helped-but someone in the Project was selling secrets to an interstellar mafia called the Tonkuztra about the real state of affairs on Earth. And Devaney knew that Chloe Bryant, the woman he had fallen in love with, was being set up to take a fall for the real traitor, who was about to embark on a treason whose consequences could jeopardize the very Universe. . . .	2006-12-12	Baen						ZZZ000000

Replete with detailed imagery of the landscape, characters and politics that have made the jungle-infested peninsula a Shangri-La for so many over the years, Yellow Eyes is a hard-hitting look at facing a swarming alien horde with not much more than wits and guts.

But it will take four years, a scientific breakthrough, the largest manhunt in British crime annals, and the blooding of more than four thousand men before the real killer is found."Wambaughs darkest nonfiction since "The Onion Field." . . .

9780553840384	One Door Away from Heaven	Dean Koontz		Hailed as "America's most popular suspense novelist" (Rolling Stone) Dean Koontz has entered a rich new phase of his writing career that is yielding his most imaginative, meaningful, and popular work yet. At the height of his powers as a literary craftsman, he has won the acclaim of critics as well as the allegiance of millions of fans the world over, transforming the greatest fears and hopes of our time into masterworks of dazzling originality and emotional resonance. Now, with the stunning depth and virtuosity of his storytelling, he brings to readers one of his most gripping and richly imagined novels to date an intoxicating story of adventure and suspense, mystery and revelation, told with humor, heart, and high art. One Door Away From Heaven In a dusty trailer park on the far edge of the California dream, Michelina Bellsong contemplates the choices she has made. At twenty-eight, she wants to change the direction of her troubled life but can't find her way until a new family settles into the rental trailer next door and she meets the young girl who will lead her on a remarkable quest that will change Micky herself and everything she knows or thinks she knows forever. Despite the brace she must wear on her deformed left leg, and her withered left hand, nine-year-old Leilani Klonk radiates a buoyant and indomitable spirit that inspires Micky. Beneath Leilani's effervescence, however, Micky comes to sense a quiet desperation that the girl dares not express. Leilani's mother is little more than a child herself. And the girl's stepfather, Preston Maddoc, is educated but threatening. He has moved the family from place to place as he fanatically investigates UFO sightings, striving to make contact, claiming to have had a vision that by Leilani's tenth birthday aliens will either heal her or take her away to a better life on their world. Slowly, ever more troubling details emerge in Leilani's conversations with Micky. Most chilling is Micky's discovery that Leilani had an older brother, also disabled, who vanished after Maddoc took him into the woods one night and is now "gone to the stars." Leilani's tenth birthday is approaching. Micky is convinced the girl will be dead by that day. While the child-protection bureaucracy gives Micky the runaround, the Maddoc family slips away into the night. Micky sets out across America to track and find them, alone and afraid but for the first time living for something bigger than herself. She finds herself pitted against an adversary, Preston Maddoc, as fearsome as he is cunning. The passion and disregard for danger with which Micky pursues her quest bring to her side a burned-out detective who joins her on a journey of incredible peril and startling discoveries, a journey through terrible darkness to unexpected light. One Door Away From Heaven is an incandescent mix of suspense and humor, fear and wonder, a story of redemption and timeless wisdom that will have readers cheering. Filled with tragedy and joy, with terror and hope, it solidifies Dean Koontz's reputation as one of the foremost storytellers of our time. This is Dean Koontz at his very best and it doesn't get any better than that. From the Hardcover edition.	2002-02	Random House, Inc.						ZZZ000000

9780593060575	Target Basra	Mike Rossiter		In the dead of night on 20 March 2003, Royal Navy Marines from 40 and 42 Commando board a fleet of twenty helicopters.With faces blackened and mouths dry at the thought of what lies ahead, they have been given the job of capturing the oil pipelines and pumping stations through which 90 per cent of Iraq's oil is exported, to seal off the whole of the Faw peninsula and hold it against any counter-attack by the Iraqi Army. They will be the first troops on the ground in Iraq, literally kicking the door down. They will also suffer the first allied casualties in the war to overthrow Saddam Hussein. Operation Telic was a bold and audacious break with military doctrine, a night-time airborne assault against heavily defended positions. Lightly armed and isolated, the Commandos' only support for the first few days came from Royal Navy ships HMS Ark Royal and Ocean sailing off the coast. The night-time landing was just the beginning. The Commandos were engaged in a series of fast-moving and hard-fought battles against tanks, Ba'ath party Fedayeen and Republican Guards as they moved rapidly north up the Faw peninsula until they reached the outskirts ofBasra, the second-largest city in Iraq. Finally, after a two-day battle that broke the back of the Iraqi resistance, and eighteen days after their first contact with the enemy, Royal Marine Commandos entered the presidential palace in Basra. Told from the perspective, and with the cooperation of officers and men in the Royal Navy and the Royal Marines, Target Basra is a story of courage, fortitude and the harsh realities of modern war, fought in the context of the turmoil of the Middle East.	2008-07-14	Bantam						ZZZ000000

He s survived everything a hostile universe can throw at him, but it s not luck that s kept him alive. A lucky man wouldn t be picked out of obscurity to serve in the army of his Emperor, OctoV, a machine-human hybrid who appears to be a teenage boy but is actually immeasurably older. Maybe Sven s survived out of sheer bloody-mindedness (although let s not forget his enhanced healing abilities and preternatural strength). He and his squad of auxiliaries are in Farlight, capital of the Octavian Empire, for a bit of R & R. But the emperor is missing and what begin as riots soon turn to slaughter as civil unrest erupts into civil war. And behind the double-crosses and Byzantine betrayals that threaten to topple OctoV from his throne is, of course, the U/Free, a galaxy-spanning empire with the technology of gods and the morals of schoolchildren. As anarchy takes over, Sven could choose stay low and do nothing. But when has he ever done anything that sensible?	2009-06-18	Bantam						ZZZ000000

Employing cutting-edge film technologies and spectacular special effects, this ambitious new film will re-imagine this epic tale for the 21st century and will do for the story of Beowulf what the '300' did for the Battle of Thermopylae...	2007-11-05	Bantam Paperbacks						FIC009000
9780553819564	The Westies,Inside New York's Irish Mob	T. J. English		Even among the Mob, the Westies were feared. Out of a partnership between two sadistic thugs - James Coonan and Mickey Featherstone - the gang dominated the decaying slice of New York City's West Side known as Hell's Kitchen in the 1970s and '80s. Excelling in extortion, numbers running, loansharking and drug-peddling, they became the most notorious gang in the history of organized crime. The then prosecutor Rudolf Giuliani called them 'the most savage organisation in the long history of New York street gangs'. Upping the ante on brutality and depravity, their speciality when it came to punishment and killings was dismemberment. Their reign lasted almost twenty - their end would come as their own violent natures got the best of them and precipitated a downfall as infamous as their rise. This revised and updated edition, brings the story of the Westies up to date with 'where are they now' snapshots of the men - and women - of the Westies.	2008-07-14	Bantam						ZZZ000000

9780465006786	Thread of the Silkworm	Iris Chang		This book tells the story of one of the most monumental blunders the United States committed during its shameful era of McCarthyism. It is the biography of a pioneer of the American space age who was mysteriously accused of being a Communist and deported to China, where he became -- to America's continuing chagrin -- the father of the Chinese missile program.  Dr. Tsien Hsue-shen was as important a figure to the birth of the space age as Alan Turing was to the birth of the computer age. At the height of his career, he held the Robert Goddard Chair of Jet Propulsion at Cal Tech and was featured in "Time" magazine and quoted extensively elsewhere. He helped lay the foundation for the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. Both during and after World War II, he worked on classified military projects for the U.S. government. Then suddenly he was put under a horrendous five-year house arrest and ultimately kicked out of the country in 1955. If his life had ended then, it would have been interesting but hardly extraordinary. But over the next few decades Tsien directed the development of the Dong Feng East Wind and Silkworm missiles in China -- in the process transforming a primitive military culture into one capable of delivering nuclear bombs intercontinentally.  Tsien's story made headlines around the world and continues to tantalize the scientific community. Was he a spy? "Thread of the Silkworm" explores this question. A compelling story of tragedy and triumph that spans more than eighty years of Chinese and American history, the book winds from the crumbling of a four-century-old dynasty in China to the terror of Japanese air raids over Shanghai, from the secretAmerican missile tests in southern California to the deadly concentration camp factories of the V-2 rocket in Germany, from Tsien's imprisonment on a small island in the United States to his conferences with the leaders of Russia and China. "Thread of the Silkworm" is the story of a scientist, aloof and shy, who tried to devote his life to science but who found himself on two continents at the vortex of the fickle, ever-shifting winds of world politics and war."Compelling. . . . Tsien Hsue-Shen deserves a place beside Sergei Korolev and Wernher von Braun in the pantheon of rocketry. But no historian possessed the unique technical and linguistic skills needed to attempt his biography until Iris Chang."--Walter A. McDougall, author of "The Heavens and the Earth" "A captivating account . . . illustrates how the excesses of the McCarthy era drove talent from America to the benefit of another nation."--Arnold Kramish, Manhattan Project scientist and author of "The Griffin"	1996-11-14	Basic Books						ZZZ000000
9780465030781	I am a strange loop	Douglas R. Hofstadter		What do we mean when we say "I"? Can thought arise out of matter? Can a self, a soul, a consciousness, an "I" arise out of mere matter? If it cannot, then how can you or I be here? I Am a Strange Loop argues that the key to understanding selves and consciousness is the "strange loop"--a special kind of abstract feedback loop inhabiting our brains. Deep down, a human brain is a chaotic seething soup of particles, on a higher level it is a jungle of neurons, and on a yet higher level it is a network of abstractions that we call "symbols." The most central and complex symbol in your brain or mine is the one we both call "I." The "I" is the nexus in our brain where the levels feed back into each other and flip causality upside down, with symbols seeming to have free will and to have gained the paradoxical ability to push particles around, rather than the reverse. For each human being, this "I" seems to be the realest thing in the world. But how can such a mysterious abstraction be real--or is our "I" merely a convenient fiction? Does an "I" exert genuine power over the particles in our brain, or is it helplessly pushed around by the all-powerful laws of physics?

9780465024964	The classical world,an epic history from Homer to Hadrian	Robin Lane Fox		The classical civilizations of Greece and Rome once dominated the world, and they continue to fascinate and inspire us. Classical art and architecture, drama and epic, philosophy and politics--these are the foundations of Western civilization. In The Classical World, eminent classicist Robin Lane Fox brilliantly chronicles this vast sweep of history from Homer to the reign of Augustus. From the Peloponnesian War through the creation of Athenian democracy, from the turbulent empire of Alexander the Great to the creation of the Roman Empire and the emergence of Christianity, Robin Lane Fox serves as our witty and trenchant guide. He introduces us to extraordinary heroes and horrific villains, great thinkers and blood-thirsty tyrants. Throughout this vivid tour of two of the greatest civilizations the world has ever known, we remain in the hands of a great master.	2006-10-09	Basic Books						ZZZ000000
9780465027637	Unstrange minds,remapping the world of autism	Roy Richard Grinker		Unstrange Minds documents Grinker's quest to find out why autism is so much more common today, and to uncover the implications of the increase. His search took him to Africa, India, and East Asia, to the National Institutes of Mental Health, and to the mountains of Appalachia. What he discovered is both surprising and controversial: There is no true increase in autism. Grinker shows that the identification and treatment of autism depends on culture just as much as on science. As more and more cases of autism are documented, doctors are describing the disorder better, school systems are coding it better--and children are benefiting. Filled with moving stories and informed by the latest science, Unstrange Minds is unlike any other book on autism. It is a powerful testament to a father's quest for the truth, and is urgently relevant to anyone whose life is touched by one of history's most puzzling disorders.	2007-01-22	Basic Books						ZZZ000000
9780465002177	The economic naturalist,in search of explanations for everyday enigmas	Robert H. Frank		Why do the keypads on drive-up cash machines have Braille dots? Why are round-trip fares from Orlando to Kansas City higher than those from Kansas City to Orlando? For decades, Robert Frank has been asking his economics students to pose and answer questions like these as a way of learning how economic principles operate in the real world--which they do everywhere, all the time.Once you learn to think like an economist, all kinds of puzzling observations start to make sense. Drive-up ATM keypads have Braille dots because it's cheaper to make the same machine for both drive-up and walk-up locations. Travelers from Kansas City to Orlando pay less because they are usually price-sensitive tourists with many choices of destination, whereas travelers originating from Orlando typically choose Kansas City for specific family or business reasons.The Economic Naturalist employs basic economic principles to answer scores of intriguing questions from everyday life, and, along the way, introduces key ideas such as the cost benefit principle, the "no cash left on the table" principle, and the law of one price. There is no more delightful and painless way of learning these fundamental principles.	2007	Westview Press						ZZZ000000

9780563487197	A history of Britain,The fate of empire, 1776-2000	Simon Schama		While Britain was losing an empire it was finding itself. Award-winning historian Simon Schama completes his monumental three-volume history of Britain. In The Fate of Empire, Schama illuminates the period of British history from 1770 to 2000 through a variety of historical themes and key British characters. Britain never had the kind of revolution experienced by France in 1789, but it did come close. In the mid-1770s the country was intoxicated by a great surge of political energy. Re-discovering Englands wildernesses, the intellectuals of the Romantic generation also discovered the plight of the common man, turning Nature into a revolutionary force. This power of the cult of nature enabled two things to make man see and explore Britain in a way unimaginable a generation before, and to pit democrat cosmopolitans against patriots. From the politics of wildness, A HISTORY OF BITAIN 3 moves to the Victorian era and its question of how to create a better world in the face of upheaval. As the Victorian era began, the massive advance of technology and industrialisation was rapidly reshaping both the landscape and the social structure of the whole country. To a much greater extent than ever before women would take a centre stage role in shaping society. From political campaigners like Harriet Stuart Mill to writers like Elizabeth Gaskell whose novels highlighted the plight of the industrial working class and Mary Seacole, the heroine and nurse of the Crimea War, Victorias sisters would from now on ensure that it was no longer purely a mans world.	2003	BBC						ZZZ000000
9780563487180	A history of Britain,The British wars 1603-1776	Simon Schama		Change, sometimes gentle and subtle, more often shocking and violent-shattering ideals and shifting perspectives-is again the dynamic of this, the second volume of Schama's refreshing and compelling history of Britain.'The British wars began on the morning of July 23 1637, and the first missiles launched were stools. They flew down the nave of St. Giles' Cathedral in Edinburgh and their targets were the Dean and Bishop of Edinburgh...' The first round of the British wars had been fired, and fired on grounds of faith. over the next 200 years, other battles on other battlegrounds would be waged and would rage-both at home and abroad, on sea and on land, up and down the length of burgeoning Britain, and across three continents-Europe,America and India. Most of the British wars would be wars of faith - waged on wide-ranging grounds of political or religious conviction-between Republicans and Royalists, Catholics and Protestants, Tories and Whigs, colonialists and natives. Many of the British battles would be fought on battlefields far from Britain, as far afield as Quebec and Calcutta. Yet the wars of the British remain essentially British wars-fought by the British, for the British and between the British. But who exactly were the British and what were they fighting for ? The answers unravel as the the story of 'The Wars of the British' unfolds. It is a story of revolution and reaction, of inspiration and disillusion, of progress and catastrophe, of huge gains and massive losses, of battles fought against the odds, as when Robert Clive stood at Plassey, of James Wolfe fell at Quebec.At the heart of Schama's history lie questions of compelling importance for Britain's future as well as it's past.What makes or breaks a nation?To whom do we give our allegiance and why? And where do the boundaries of our community lie?All these questions unravel through the stories that Schama loves to tell, in a form at once traditional and excitingly fresh. The great and the unforgettable are here-Oliver Cromwell and Bonnie Prince Charlie, Christopher Wren and Guy Fawkes, but so, too, are countless more ordinary lives such as Olaudah Equiano, an African enslaved from boyhood.All are caught on Schama's rich and teeming tapestry of British life and history.Chapter breakdown:Chpt 1: The Wars of the BritishChpt 2: Give Caesar his Due?Chpt 3: Looking for LeviathanChpt 4: Unsettled Business Chpt 5: Britannia IncorporatedChpt 6: The Wrong Empire	2003	BBC						ZZZ000000

9780563522744	The Domesday quest,in search of the roots of England	Michael Wood		In 1086, Domesday Book, perhaps the most remarkable historical document in existence, was compiled. This tremendous story of England and its people was made at the behest of the Norman king William the Conqueror. It was called Domesday, the day of judgement, because 'like the day of judgement, its decisions are unalterable'. In Search of the Roots of England is not only a study of the ancient manuscript but an attempt to analyse the world that Domesday Book so vividly portrayed. By skilful use of the Domesday record historian Michael Wood examines Norman society and the Anglo-Saxon, Roman, and even the Iron Age cultures that preceded it.	2005-09	BBC						ZZZ000000
9780563522768	In Search of the Dark Ages	Michael Wood		This new edition of Michael Wood's groundbreaking first book explores the fascinating and mysterious centuries between the Romans and the Norman Conquest of 1066.IN SEARCH OF THE DARK AGES vividly conjures up some of the most famous names in British history, such as Queen Boadicea, leader of a terrible war of resistance against the Romans, and King Arthur, the 'once and future king', for whose riddle Wood proposes a new and surprising solution. Here too, warts and all, are the Saxon, Viking and Norman kings who laid the political foundations of England - Offa of Mercia, Alfred the Great, Athelstan, and William the Conqueror, whose victory at Hastings in 1066 marked the end of Anglo-Saxon England. Reflecting recent historical, textual and archaeological research, this revised and updated edition of Michael Wood's classic book overturns preconceptions of the Dark Ages as a shadowy and brutal era, showing them to be a richly exciting and formative period in the history of Britain.	2005	BBC						ZZZ000000
9783822848012	The Golden Age of Advertising,The 60s	Jim Heimann		Ads from the space age With the consumerist euphoria of the fifties still going strong and the race to the moon at its height, the mood of advertising in the sixties was cheerful, optimistic, and at times, revolutionary. The decade's ads touted perceived progress (such as Tang-?just add water?) while striving to reinforce good old American values. Stars like Raquel Welch, Sean Connery, Woody Allen, and Sammy Davis Jr. endorsed everything from sunglasses to bourbon to handmade suits in an attempt by Madison Avenue to urge Americans to open their wallets and participate in one giant consumer binge. Social change at the end of the era brought psychedelic swirls and liberated women and minorities to a newly conscious public. From forgotten cars such as the Studebaker Avanti, to cigarettes (?Marlboro... a man's world of flavor?) to food, clothing, consumer products, furniture, travel, and much more, this colorful collection of print ads explores the wide, wonderful world of 60s Americana.	2005	Taschen						ZZZ000000
9783822849392	Collecting contemporary	Adam Lindemann		Words from the wise: insiders? tips on how to navigate the art market like a pro Art is about life, the art market is about money. ?Damien Hirst Whether you?re an art fan, aficionado, or collector, this completely unique book should be on your required reading list. Like a textbook for a class given by all of the world's leading experts, Collecting Contemporary is the one and only book to teach you everything you ever wanted to know about the contemporary art market. The introduction explains the ABCs of buying art on the primary and secondary markets, at auction, and at art fairs and gives an overview of the world art scene and its social circles. The main body of the book brings together tell-all interviews with the biggest players in the global art market: the Critic (Rimanelli), the Dealer (Boesky, Brunnet/Hackert, Coles, Deitch, Fortes, Gagosian, Gladstone, Glimcher, Hetzler, Lybke, Perrotin, Rosen, Shave, Wirth), the Consultant (Cortez, Fletcher, Heller, Segalot, Westreich), the Collector (Brant, Broad, Habsburg, Joannou, Lambert, Lehmann, Lopez, Paz, Pinault, Rothschild Foundation, Saatchi), the Auction House Expert (Cappellazzo, de Pury, Meyer), and the Museum Curator/Director (Dennison, Eccles, Heiss, Lowry, Peyton-Jones). Rounding up the book are chapters on the year in art collecting?giving a timeline of the most important annual auctions, exhibitions, fairs, etc. around the world?as well as a glossary of terms every art savvy player should know. The text is illustrated by the work of the hottest artists in today's market, including Matthew Barney, Jean-Michel Basquiat, Damien Hirst, Mike Kelley, Martin Kippenberger, Jeff Koons, Takashi Murakami, Richard Serra, Cindy Sherman, Andy Warhol, Lisa Yuskavage, and many more. All in all, these elements add up to the equivalent of an invaluable and privileged real-world collector's education?all between the covers of one book. The author: Adam Lindemann started collecting tribal art as well as works of artists of the 80s before turning to contemporary art, which has been his passion for the past several years. This book was conceived as a short handbook of information and advice for new collectors, but Lindemann's research eventually led him to an international tour of the art world and personal interviews with some of its leading figures. The results are shared with the reader on these pages?along with images of over a hundred art works which help define the contemporary art market today.	2006-06-01	Taschen						ZZZ000000

9783822825723	LaChapelle, heaven to hell	David LaChapelle		LaChapelle Heaven to Hell is the long-awaited third volume in an exhilarating trilogy that began with LaChapelle Land (1996) and continued with the infamous Hotel LaChapelle (1999). Packed with astonishing, color-saturated, and provocative images, those titles both became instant collector's items and have since gone through multiple printings. Featuring almost twice as many images as its predecessors, LaChapelle Heaven to Hell is an explosive compilation of new work by the visionary photographer. Since the publication of Hotel LaChapelle, the strength of LaChapelle's work lies in its ability to focus the lens of celebrity and fashion toward more pressing issues of societal concern. LaChapelle's images ? of the most famous faces on the planet, and marginalized figures like transsexual Amanda Lepore or the cast of his critically acclaimed social documentary Rize ? call into question our relationship with gender, glamour, and status. Using his trademark baroque excess, LaChapelle inverts the consumption he appears to celebrate, pointing instead to apocalyptic consequences for humanity itself. While referencing and acknowledging diverse sources such as the Renaissance, art history, cinema, The Bible, pornography, and the new globalized pop culture, LaChapelle has fashioned a deeply personal and epoch-defining visual language that holds up a mirror to our times. Sumptuously packaged in the trilogy's boxed hardcover format, LaChapelle Heaven to Hell is a must-have for anyone interested in contemporary photography. It is also keenly priced, especially for those who have coveted TASCHEN's limited edition, LaChapelle, Artists & Prostitutes. The artist: Not yet out of high school, DavidLaChapelle was offered his first professional job by Andy Warhol to shoot for Interview magazine. His photography has been showcased in numerous galleries and museums, including Tony Shafrazi Gallery and Deitch Projects in New York, the Fahey-Klein Gallery in California, Camerawork in Germany, Sozzani and Palazzo delle Esposizioni in Italy. His unfettered images of celebrity and contemporary pop culture have appeared on and between the covers of magazines such as Italian Vogue, French Vogue, Vanity Fair, Rolling Stoneand i-D. LaChapelle has also directed music videos for artists such as Moby, Jennifer Lopez, Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, and The Vines. His burgeoning interest in film saw him make the short documentary Krumped, an award-winner at Sundance from which he developed RIZE, the feature film released worldwide in 2005 to huge critical acclaim. American Photo recently ranked him as one of the top ten ?Most Important People in Photography.?	2006	Taschen						ZZZ000000
9783822856260	Film Posters Horror	Tony Nourmand&Graham Marsh&Christopher Frayling		This splendid, if scary, collection of movie posters covers over 80 years of horror films and features all the classics of the genre from early silents such as Nosferatu (illustrated here with a hitherto unpublished poster) and The Cabinet of Dr Caligari to contemporary blockbusters like Silence of the Lambs. The films are grouped by categories, such as Universal Studios' uniquely rich hoard of horror, the products of British horror specialists Hammer Films, Japanese horror movies, horror spoofs such as An American Werewolf in London, or serial killer movies. Also featured is the work of directors who are wholly or partly remembered for their contribution to the genre, like Roman Polanski (Repulsion and Rosemary's Baby), Alfred Hitchcock (The Birds and Psycho), David Cronenberg (The Fly) and Brian de Palma (Carrie and Sisters). Horror, perhaps more than any other genre, offers the poster artist the opportunity to create an image that is both disturbing and memorable. This book shows just how rich is the tradition upon which movie-goers can draw for their nightmares.	2006-05-01	Taschen						ZZZ000000
9783822847107	Film Posters of the 90s,The Essential Movies of the Decade	Tony Nourmand&Graham Marsh		Whatever your taste in movies, the filmmakers of the 1990s had it covered. On the one hand, the big studios took advantage of the ever-increasing sophistication of computer-generated imagery to produce spectacular, mega-budget 'event' movies like Titanic, The Matrix and Mission: Impossible; on the other, a new generation of independents like Tarantino and the Coen Brothers was winning its spurs with low-tech and often low-budget productions such as Reservoir Dogs and The Big Lebowski. Spielberg turned his attention to the Second World War with Saving Private Ryan, Eastwood and Costner gave the Western a new lease of life with Unforgiven and Dances With Wolves, and the Brits chipped in with two unexpected successes, The Full Monty and Trainspotting. From the eerie psychosis of The Silence Of The Lambs to the romantic fantasy Pretty Woman, this was a decade that offered something for everyone. Hollywood may have become besotted by all things digital, but print on paper, in the form of the poster, remained one of the most important means of promoting movies of all kinds, and the poster artists of the 90s proved that they could still produce striking and alluring images. This book reproduces the pick of the decade.	2005	Taschen						ZZZ000000

These developments have laid the groundwork for an indigenous modernity that differentiates itself from outside schools as well as eschewing the temptation to put a "Chinese-style" roof on ordinary office blocks. The fact that Beijing has been chosen to host the 2008 Summer Olympic Games has been more than a catalyst for the development of high-quality contemporary architecture in China. Major foreign firms like OMA/Rem Koolhaas or Herzog & de Meuron are participating in the design of buildings that will have functions during the Games, but Chinese architects, too, have been mobilized in this massive effort to prepare the country for an unprecedented level of world-wide attention.

9780552771283	Perfect Red,Empire, Espionage and the Quest for the Colour of Desire	Amy Butler Greenfield		A PERFECT RED recounts the colourful history of cochineal, a legendary red dye that was once one of the world's most precious commodities. Treasured by the ancient Mexicans, cochineal was sold in the great Aztec marketplaces, where it attracted the attention of the Spanish conquistadors in 1519. Shipped to Europe, the dye created a sensation, producing the brightest, strongest red the world had ever seen. Soon Spain's cochineal monopoly was worth a fortune.Desperate to find their own sources of the elusive dye, the English, the French, the Dutch, and other Europeans tried to crack the enigma of cochineal. Did it come from a worm, a berry, a seed? Could it be stolen from Mexico and transplanted to their own colonies? Pirates, explorers, alchemists, scientists, and spies - all joined the chase for cochineal, a chase that lasted for more than three centuries. A PERFECT RED tells their stories - true-life tales of mystery, empire, and adventure, in pursuit of the most desirable colour on earth.	2006-06-06	Black Swan						ZZZ000000

9780747595786	The new Cold War,how the Kremlin menaces both Russia and the West	Edward Lucas		In the 1990s, Russia was the sick man of Europe, but the rise to power of former KGB officer Vladimir Putin in 1999 coincided with a huge hike in world oil and gas prices, and after Yeltsin's downfall Putin set about re-establishing Russian autocracy. Now with its massive gas and oil reserves Russia has not only paid off its debts but amassed huge cash reserves which it is investing in easily accessible European businesses. Putin's Russia is hostile to open debate. Critics inside Russia such as the journalist Anna Politkovskaya, and opponents abroad such as the defector Alexander Litvinenko, a British subject, have been assassinated. Russia has threatened to target its nuclear missiles on America's allies in eastern Europe. It has resumed the military bullying of its neighbours, including repeated airspace violations; its generals play war games involving the recapture of the Baltic states. These are familiar tactics, but a whole new breed of Kremlin dirty tricks is still more sinister. The cyber-attacks on Estonia in May 2007 showed Russia was ready to wipe a country off the online map. Russia is stitching up Europe's gas market, giving it huge influence both within and on Europe. Many people, out of naiveteacute; or greed, deny the existence of the problem. Russia has so far sidelined America, its most formidable opponent in the last cold war: America needs Russia co-operation on North Korea, Iran and the Middle East, leaving the way clear for the Kremlin. The New Cold War explains both the Kremlin's tactics and the West's weaknesses. Why we are perilously close to defeat and - and how we can still win.	2008	Bloomsbury						ZZZ000000
9780747595601	Novel about my wife	Emily Perkins		If I could build her again using words, I would: starting at her long, painted feet and working up, meticulously shading in every cell and gap and space for breath until her pulse just couldn't help but kick back in to life. Her hip bones, her red knuckles, the soft skin of her thighs, her fine crackle of hair. When Tom and Ann move from their tiny Camden flat into a large semi-derelict house in Hackney, it feels like the start of proper adulthood, though both are well into their thirties. Ann's room at St Bartholomew's hospital, coated in plaster-dust from the medical casts she moulds all day, is not quite what she had imagined when she was a sassy student at the Slade, while Tom's scriptwriting career seems to have stalled while he tinkers with endless drafts of his vampire movie. But, still deeply in love with his beautiful wife, with a baby on the way and a place of their own, it feels to Tom as though life is on the up. If they sometimes have to rely on credit cards for their weekly shop, well, plenty of aspirational London couples are doing the same. Ann is galvanised by her pregnancy: her long hair loose, her elegant body lent a new luscious fullness, she spends hours cleaning and reorganising the house, and sits up all night talking with a new feverish passion about sculpture. But there is a darker side to this new fervour, somehow linked with her conviction that someone is lingering threateningly around their new home. Someone who - Tom soon realises - may not exist at all. Dark, sensuous and utterly compelling, Novel About my Wife is a sexy, chilling novel about the secrets that lie at the heart of every marriage.	2008-05-05	Bloomsbury						ZZZ000000

9780747584452	The best intentions,Kofi Annan and the UN in the era of American world power	James Traub		Kofi Annan described 2004 as his annus horribilis. A man who had received the Nobel Peace Prize, who was widely counted one of the greatest UN secretaries general, was nearly hounded from office by scandal. Indeed, both Annan and the institution he incarnates were so deeply shaken after the invasion of Iraq that critics, and even some friends, began asking whether this sixty-year-old experiment in global policing has outlived its usefulness. Do its failures arise from its own structure and culture, or from a clash with an American administration determined to go its own way in defiance of world opinion? James Traub, who enjoyed unprecendented access to Annan and his top aides, shadowing the UN's work for two years, delves into these questions as no one else has done before. He describes the Oil-for-Food scandal, the deep divide between those who wished to accommodate American critics and those who wished to confront them, the failed attempt to act decisively against ethnic cleansing in Sudan. And he recounts Annan's effort to respond to criticism with sweeping reform-an effort which ultimately shattered under the resistance of U.S. Ambassador John Bolton. In The Best Intentions, Traub recounts the dramatically entwined history of Kofi Annan, the United Nations, and American foreign policy from 1992 to the present. In Annan he sees a conscientious idealist given too little credit for advancing causes like humanitarian intervention and an honest broker crushed between American conservatives and third world opponents-but also a UN careerist who has absorbed its stultifying culture and cannot, in the end, escape its limitations.	2006	Bloomsbury						ZZZ000000

9780747590675	The opposite house	Helen Oyeyemi		Maja Carmen Carrera, the daughter of a black Cuban couple, was only five years old when the family emigrated from the Caribbean to London, leaving her with one complete memory: a woman singing eerily at the farewell party while little Maja and an older girl peered out from beneath a table. Now, almost twenty years later, Maja herself is a singer with a small band, in love with her boyfriend, pregnant and haunted by what she calls 'her Cuba.' Growing up in London, she struggles to negotiate her history and the sense that speaking the Spanish or the English of her people's conquistadors makes her less of a black girl. But she is unable to find in herself the Ewe, Igbo, or Swahili of her roots. It seems all that's left is silence. Distance from Cuba deepens Maja's mother's faith in Santeria - the fusion of Catholicism and West African religion - and its Yoruba gods, but it also divides the family as her father rails against his wife's superstitions and the lost dreams of the Castro revolution. On the other side of the reality wall, Yemaya Saramagua lives in the Somewherehouse with two doors: one opening to London, the other to Lagos. Yemaya is troubled by the ease with which her fellow gods have disguised themselves as saints and reappeared under different names and faces. As Yemaya and Maja seek out their own truth as to where home lies, they come to the realization that transformation can be at once painful and exhilarating indeed.	2007-05-07	Bloomsbury						ZZZ000000
9780747590194	Shakespeare's wife	Germaine Greer		A polemical, ground-breaking study of Elizabethan England that reclaims Ann Hathaway's rightful place in history. Little is known about the wife of the world's most famous playwright; a great deal, none of it complimentary, has been assumed. The omission of her name from Shakespeare's will has been interpreted as evidence that she was nothing more than an unfortunate mistake from which Shakespeare did well to distance himself. Yet Shakespeare is above all the poet of marriage. Before him, there were few comedies or tragedies about wooing or wedding. And yet he explored the sacrament in all its aspects, spiritual, psychological, sexual, sociological, and was the creator of some of the most tenacious and intelligent heroines in English literature. Is it possible, therefore, that Ann, who has been mocked and vilified by scholars for centuries, was the inspiration? Until now, there has been no serious critical scholarship devoted to the life and career of the farmer's daughter who married England's greatest poet. Part biography, part history, Shakespeare's Wife is a fascinating reconstruction of Ann's life, and an illuminating look at the daily lives of Elizabethan women, from their working routines to the rituals of courtship and the minutiae of married life. In this thoroughly researched and controversial book, Greer steps off the well-trodden paths of orthodoxy, asks new questions, and begins to right the wrongs done to Ann Shakespeare.	2007	Bloomsbury						ZZZ000000
9780224082037	LIFE INC.,HOW THE WORLD BECAME A CORPORATION AND HOW TO TAKE	Douglas Rushkoff		* Something has gone terribly wrong. We are deep in the thrall of a system that no one really likes, no one remembers asking for, yet no one can escape. It just is. And the minute it seems as if we can put our finger on what's happening to us or how it came to be this way, the insight disappears, drowned out by the more immediately pressing demands by everyone and everything on our attention. What did they just say? My phone is vibrating . * In Life Inc Douglas Rushkoff offers a timely, provocative and urgent look at the origins and nature of the modern corporate system, a world in which everything can be commodified, a closed system that conquers not through exclusion but total inclusion. Under current conditions market forces have achieved a nightmarish triumph everything, including dissidence, is assimilated. * Life Inc tells the story of how we got here and, more importantly, how this value system now perpetuates itself. Rushkoff reveals the process through which media conglomerates conceive and assimilate everything from teen icons to online communities, and replace anything resembling civic engagement with yet another consumer choice. His goal is nothing less than to give us the view from outside of the hermetically sealed shopping mall in which we spend our lives.	2009-06-04	Random House						ZZZ000000

9780714126500	A new world,England's first view of America	Kim Sloan&Joyce E. Chaplin&Christian F. Feest&Ute Kuhlemann		This beautiful book reproduces in full the famous and rarely seen British Museum collection of drawings and watercolours made by John White, who in 1585 accompanied a group of English settlers sent by Sir Walter Raleigh to found a colony in `Virginia', along the tidewaters of coastal North Carolina. White's duties included making visual records of everything then unknown in England, including plants, animals and birds as well as the human inhabitants, especially their dress, weapons, tools and ceremonies. The collection also includes his watercolours of Florida and Brazilian Indians, and the Inuit encountered by Martin Frobisher. In this landmark catalogue, each work is reproduced in colour and is thoroughly described, supplemented by engravings by Theodor de Bry and other comparable works. The introduction is followed by three specially commissioned chapters covering John White himself, the indigenous inhabitants, and their historical context. The book explores White's role as a colonist, surveyor and artist who not only recorded the plants and animals but also provided a window on a now lost Native American culture and way of life.	2007	British Museum Press						ZZZ000000

9781841953854	Home and exile	Chinua Achebe		This trenchant and illuminating book by one of Africa's most celebrated writers is a major statement on the importance and dangers of stories, one in which Achebe makes telling use of his personal experiences to examine the political nature of culture and specifically literature. It is the weaving of the personal into the bigger picture that makes Home and Exile so remarkable and affecting. It's the closest we are likely to get by way of Achebe's autobiography but it is also a brilliantly argued critique of imperialism. Through it Achebe challenges the way the West has appropriated Africa with a particular emphasis on how "imperialist" literature has been used to justify its dispossession and degradation of a continent. Above all this is a book that articulates persuasively why literature matters. Stories are a real source of power in the world, he concludes, and to imitate the literature of another culture is to give that power away.	2003	Canongate						ZZZ000000

Andrew Greig depicts vividly the stark and hostile beauty of the highest mountain range in the world as well as the warm fellowship at Base Camp and above. His candid but affectionate portraits of the members of the team go a long way towards answering the inevitable questions of why climbers climb and, with his engaging tone and great writing skill, make this an exceptional travel book for a wide readership. Much more than a book about climbing, Summit Fever celebrates the risk, joy and adventure of being alive.	2005-11-10	Canongate Books						ZZZ000000

9781841959078	Lanark,A Life in Four Books	Alasdair Gray&William Boyd		Lanark, a modern vision of hell, is set in the disintegrating cities of Unthank and Glasgow, and tells the interwoven stories of Lanark and Duncan Thaw.

Comparisons have been made to Dante, Blake, Joyce, Orwell, Kafka, Huxley and Lewis Carroll.

From the highs of Purple Rain and Sign O' The Times to the bitter quarrels and commercial failures of the 1990s, Prince - whatever name or alias he uses - has remained a compulsively creative force and a unique voice in rock, pop, soul or whatever he turns his hand to.	2007-03-29	Canongate						ZZZ000000

For the remainder of his life, Aga Akbar used these cuneiform characters to fill a notebook with writings only he could understand. Years later, his son, Ishmael--a political dissident in exile--is attempting to translate the notebook . . . and in the process tells his father's story, his own, and the story of twentieth-century Iran.

9781841959092	Jungle capitalists : a story of globalisation, greed and revolution	Peter Chapman		Jungle Capitalists reveals how one company pioneered the growth of globalisation and, in doing so, helped farm the banana to the point of extinction. In this powerful and gripping book, Peter Chapman shows how the pioneering example of the importer United Fruit set the precedent for the institutionalised greed of today's multinational companies. The story has its source in the importer United Fruit's 19th Century beginnings in the jungles of Costa Rica. It moves via the mass-marketing of the banana as the original fast food, United Fruit's involvement in an invasion of Honduras, a massacre in Columbia and a bloody coup in Guatemala, and the very public suicide on Park Avenue of the company's chairman, Eli Black, in the 1970s. From its bullying business practices to its covert links to the US government, United Fruit blazed the trail of global capitalism through the 20th Century. Chapman weaves a dramatic tale of big business, lies and power to show how one company pioneered the growth of globalisation.	2007-04-26	Canongate						ZZZ000000

9781841958705	Girl meets boy	Ali Smith		Another internationally acclaimed writer contributes a fascinating, compelling reinterpretation of a myth that resonates deeply today. Ligdus and Telethusa are having a child, but they cannot afford to have a girl. Ligdus informs Telethusa that she had better hope for a boy. While this decision makes them both sad, Telethusa "must/obey." She prays to Isis, but births a girl and names her Iphis, a name that "suited male or female-/a neutral name." She convinces everyone, including Ligdus, that Iphis is a boy. Iphis matures and falls in love with another girl, Ianthe, and is engaged for marriage, yet s/he is ruled by the sexual norms of the time: "[P]ossessed by love so strange . . . no female wants/a female!" but "no learned art-can ever make of me/a boy." She attempts to reconcile her love for Ianthe against the pressures of "nature." The wedding day is near, Telethusa is desperate, and prays again to Isis. Iphis is transformed, looking like a boy. Is Ovid suggesting that what we think is nature is attitude? Does Iphis grow a penis? Or does Iphis, adopting the characteristics of a boy, remain a girl married to a girl, undermining traditional values?	2007	Canongate						ZZZ000000

As the newcomers struggle to establish a settlement for themselves and their cargo of convicts, and attempts are made to communicate with those who already inhabit this land, Rooke sets up his observatory to chart the stars.

9781847671264	Don't rhyme for the sake of riddlin',the authorised story of Public Enemy	Russell Myrie		Public Enemy are one of the greatest hip-hop acts of all time. Exploding out of Long Island, New York in the early 1980s, their firebrand lyrical assault, the Bomb Squad's innovative production techniques, and their unmistakeable live performances gave them a formidable reputation. They terrified the establishment, and have continued to blaze a trail over a twenty year period up until the present day. Today, they are more autonomous and as determined as ever, still touring and finding more ingenious ways of distributing their music.Russell Myrie has had unprecedented access to the group, conducting extensive interviews with Chuck D, Flavor Flav, Terminator X, Professor Griff, the Shocklee brothers, and many others who form part of their legacy. He tells the stories behind the making of seminal albums such as their debut Yo! Bum Rush the Show, the breakthrough It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold us Back, and multi-million selling Fear of a Black Planet. He tackles Professor Griff's alleged anti-semitic remarks which caused massive controversy in the late eighties, the complexities of the group's relationship with the Nation of Islam, their huge crossover appeal with the alternative audience in the early nineties, and the strange circumstances of Flavor Flav's re-emergence as a Reality TV Star since the turn of the millennium.Urgent, incisive and definitive, Don't Rhyme for the Sake of Riddlin' is the ultimate guide to the group that tells it like it is, and insists that hip-hop is a lethal weapon for the social and politically conscious. Russell Myrie shows how, in a time of rampant profligacy and meaningless posturing in hip-hop, their diatribes still cut to the heart of the American dream, and they are as important and necessary as ever.	2009-06-18	Canongate						ZZZ000000

9780701180409	China witness,voices from a silent generation	Xinran		This hugely important and ground-breaking book an unprecedented oral history gives voice to a silent generation and tells the secret history of 20th century China. In 1912, five thousand years of feudal rule ended in China. Warlords, Western businessmen, soldiers, missionaries and Japanese all ruled China, exploited and fought one another and the Chinese. In 1949, Mao Zedong came to power. China Witnessis both a journey through time and through the author's own country, and a memorial to an extraordinary generation of men and women who have survived war, invasion, revolution, famine and modernization to tell the story of their times. It is an extraordinary personal testimony from a normally silent generation who, in their lifetimes have seen China transformed from a largely peasant, agricultural country of more than 1.3 billion people into a modern state. These are ordinary people a herb woman at a market, retired teachers, a legendary "bandit" woman, Red Guards, oil pioneers, an acrobat, a naval general, a shoe mender, a lantern maker, taxi drivers, and others from west to east, across the vast country, now in their seventies, eighties and nineties, and whose memories will soon die with them. Here, for the first time many of them speak out about their lives and private thoughts about what they witnessed. Together their intimate stories are perhaps the only accurate record of modern Chinese history. From the Hardcover edition.	2008-10-07	Chatto & Windus						ZZZ000000

9780701181666	The Kindly Ones	Jonathan Littell		This Faustian story with a terrifying twist is the fictional memoir of Dr Max Aue, a former SS intelligence officer, who has reinvented himself as a family man and owner of a lace factory in post-war France. Max is an intellectual steeped in philosophy, literature, and classical music. He is also a cold-blooded assassin and the consummate bureaucrat, who speaks out now not in self-justification but to set the record straight. He looks back at his life with cool-eyed precision: from a disrupted childhood and a turning point in his student days, to his role as observer and then participant in Nazi atrocities on the Eastern Front, from Poland to the Caucasus; he is present at the siege of Stalingrad, at the death camps, and finally caught up in the rout of the Nazis and the nightmarish fall of Berlin. Although Max is a totally imagined character, his world is peopled by real historical figures such as Eichmann, Himmler, Goring, Speer, Heydrich, Hoss, and Hitler himself. Massive in scope, terrifying in subject matter, and shocking in its protagonist, Littell's masterpiece is intense, hallucinatory, and terrifyingly compelling. Described by Le Figaro as 'a monument of contemporary literature', this transgressive and controversial work of literature has been compared to classics of world literature, including War and Peace. A huge novel about the seductive enormity of evil, about the ineffable horror of war, about man's inhumanity and the malevolence of the Furies, this is a book that every thinking person should read and to which no one can be indifferent.	2009-03-05	Chatto & Windus						ZZZ000000

Now in its fifteenth edition,The Chicago Manual of Stylethe essential reference for authors, editors, proofreaders, indexers, copywriters, designers, and publishers in any fieldis more comprehensive and easier to use than ever before. Those who work with words know how dramatically publishing has changed in the past decade, with technology now informing and influencing every stage of the writing and publishing process. In creating the fifteenth edition of theManual, Chicago's renowned editorial staff drew on direct experience of these changes, as well as on the recommendations of theManual's first advisory board, composed of a distinguished group of scholars, authors, and professionals from a wide range of publishing and business environments. Every aspect of coverage has been examined and brought up to datefrom publishing formats to editorial style and method, from documentation of electronic sources to book design and production, and everything in between. In addition to books, theManualnow also treats journals and electronic publications. All chapters are written for the electronic age, with advice on how to prepare and edit manuscripts online, handle copyright and permissions issues raised by technology, use new methods of preparing mathematical copy, and cite electronic and online sources. A new chapter covers American English grammar and usage, outlining the grammatical structure of English, showing how to put words and phrases together to achieve clarity, and identifying common errors. The two chapters on documentation have been reorganized and updated: the first now describes the two main systems preferred by Chicago, and the second discusses specific elements and subject matter, with examples of both systems. Coverage of design and manufacturing has been streamlined to reflect what writers and editors need to know about current procedures. And, to make it easier to search for information, each numbered paragraph throughout theManualis now introduced by a descriptive heading. Clear, concise, and replete with commonsense advice,The Chicago Manual of Style, fifteenth edition, offers the wisdom of a hundred years of editorial practice while including a wealth of new topics and updated perspectives. For anyone who works with words, whether on a page or computer screen, this continues to be the one reference book you simply must have. What's new in the Fifteenth Edition: * Updated material throughout to reflect current style, technology, and professional practice * Scope expanded to include journals and electronic publications * Comprehensive new chapter on American English grammar and usage by Bryan A. Garner (author ofA Dictionary of Modern American Usage) * Updated and rewritten chapter on preparing mathematical copy * Reorganized and updated chapters on documentation, including guidance on citing electronic sources * Streamlined coverage of current design and production processes, with a glossary of key terms * Descriptive headings on all numbered paragraphs for ease of reference * New diagrams of the editing and production processes for both books and journals, keyed to chapter discussions * New, expanded Web site with special tools and features forManualusers at www.chicagomanualofstyle.org	2003	University of Chicago Press						ZZZ000000

9781400049530	The Okinawa diet plan,get leaner, live longer, and never feel hungry	Bradley J. Willcox&D. Craig Willcox&Makoto Suzuki		The elders of Okinawa, Japan, are among the leanest and longest-lived people on earth. These Okinawans--many in their eighties, nineties, and beyond--maintain an unprecedented quality of life. More than any other population, older Okinawans are slim and agile, and their minds are clear and lucid. Few suffer the lifestyle-related diseases like heart disease, cancer, diabetes, and obesity that are so common in their western counterparts. In their New York Times bestseller The Okinawa Program, Drs. Bradley and Craig Willcox and Makoto Suzuki shared important insights about these unique and amazingly healthy people from their landmark twenty-five-year Okinawa Centenarian Study. The latest findings from that study are proving even more surprising: the elders do not gain weight with age. The secrets behind this discovery are twofold: the Okinawans' calorie-light diet and their active lifestyle, which results in leaner and more "metabolically efficient" bodies that stay slimmer, healthier, and more youthful as they age. In The Okinawa Diet Plan, Drs. Willcox, Willcox, and Suzuki adapt traditional Okinawan dietary principles for a delicious blend of East and West so that anyone can reap these very same benefits. The authors' Caloric Density Index and the Caloric Density Pyramid, developed from the study's latest findings, debunk the myths of trendy diet gurus and provide a revolutionary approach to eating, health, weight loss, and weight maintenance that is easy to follow and simple to maintain. This approach allows Okinawans to eat more food than the typical American diet, and still weigh less--and you can too. With more than 150 delicious recipes that incorporate foods low in caloric density, The Okinawa Diet Plan offers dozens of satisfying meal options. Conveniently divided into three tracks--western, eastern, and fusion--and with healthy options for both vegetarians and meat eaters alike, their program provides all the benefits of calorie restriction without deprivation.

9781843402503	Classic album covers of the 60s	Storm Thorgerson		The hectic cultural and political upheavals occurring in the 1960s marked a divide between the relatively stable cultural environment of the previous decade and what is now regarded as the golden age of pop music and youth culture. The flourishing of alternative cultures in the latter part of the decade laid many of the foundations of later trends and subcultures. And this influence is nowhere more apparent than in record packaging, with classic graphic design and layouts reappearing again and again. 'Classic Album Covers of the 60s' is a collection of over 200 of the very best (and in some cases) worst that designers had to offer throughout the decade. Representative designs from each period are illustrated in full colour, taking the reader on a journey from the wholesome joviality of the Very Merry Macs and Muscle Beach Party, through stylish and understated jazz cover designs, to the best psychedelic designs of the late 60s such as the Beatles' Sgt Pepper and the Incredible String Band's The 5000 Spirits. The changing style of album cover design illustrated in 'Classic Album Covers of the 60s' provides a fascinating reflection of changing cultural trends during a decade whose ideas and artistic expressions sought to break the prevailing rules and, so doing, laid the foundations for cover design today. A fantastic showcase of more than 200 classic album covers from the greatest music era Book sold more than 250,000 copies worldwide in the early 90s A timeless collector's piece for all music fans High profile author who has designed covers for Pink Floyd for 30 years	2005-05-31	Collins & Brown						ZZZ000000

Pepper's Lonely Heart Band, for example--just one of the 500 memorable images in this amazing collection, all chosen by a panel of 50 experts and each accompanied by enlightening commentary. Among the choices: the brilliantly psychedelic and way-out art from the Rolling Stones' Their Satanic Majesties Request; Peter Tosh's fiery cover for Bush Doctor; and the somewhat demented-looking prom queen on Hole's Live Through This album. From rock to pop, jazz to blues, these are all artistically, stylistically, and culturally significant in their own way, and will undoubtedly spark a debate with fans around the world.	2005-10-28	Collins & Brown						ZZZ000000
9781843402343	500 Manga Heroes and Villains	Helen McCarthy		The explosion in popularity of manga (Japanese comics) and its sister genre anime (comic films) in the western world in recent years has been nothing short of phenomenal. While many in the West still view these genres as a very modern invention rooted in a unique style of children's animation, the true origins of Japanese cartoon drawing date back almost 800 years to crude drawings on temple walls. In 1702 artist Shumboko Ono made a book out of prints of these pictures and the tradition of Toba-e, as these comics were originally known, grew over the next two centuries. Today these comics form a large proportion of the literature for the whole of Japanese society. The growth in popularity of manga in the West has been accompanied by a number of books on the subject - not merely translated manga comics but, of late, instructional guides to drawing characters. There have also been several scholarly tomes teaching the origins of the genre in Japan, but this is the first book to focus on the characters themselves, featuring 500 of the most famous from 1890 to the present day in full colour. Following a brief overview of the history of Japanese comics, the book is divided by character into chapters including male and female heroes and villains, anti-heroes, non-humanoid characters, teams, historical and literary characters. Each and every character included has a potted biography of their life in Japanese comics and the date of their first appearance, while 50 key characters such as Astro Boy, Akira, Lupin III and Pokemon are explored at length in special spotlight pages. There are also feature splashes on famous artists and series and crucial developments in the manga story. ''500 Manga Heroes and Villains' is the first book of its kind to assess the huge range of manga characters in illustrated form. Packed with colour illustrations it is an essential and accessible reference tool for first-time enthusiasts and manga historians alike. Manga has become a global phenomenon Featuring profiles of the 500 most famous manga characters Illustrated with 200 colour images Written by one of the leading experts in manga outside of Japan	2006-02-26	Collins & Brown						ZZZ000000
9781843402909	Who really won the space race?	Thom Burnett		On October 4 1957, America's self image of being the most technologically advanced nation on earth, was shattered by the successful launch of a Soviet satellite, Sputnik, months ahead of its own satellite program. Four days later President Eisenhower gave a White House press conference in which he attributed US failure to the fact that in 1945, the Soviets had captured all of the German rocket scientists at Peenemunde. But as this book will show, that presidential statement was far from true. Not only was it the United States who acquired the best of the scientists, but those that fell into the hands of the Russians were of limited use. Yet, with all that talent, America still lost the space race. Senate investigations into the reasons why soon revealed that a US army missile designed by a team of Nazi scientists, led by Werner von Braun, could have launched an American satellite a year before Sputnik, but they had been deliberately denied the opportunity. Having lost the first leg of the Space Race, with America still struggling to get into space, the Soviet Union launched yet another Sputnik, this time with a dog on board. The perception of Russian prowess and American impotence were then compounded by the disastrous launch pad explosion of a US attempt to launch its own satellite. As this book reveals for the first time, there was a conspiracy against the German scientists, both in America and the Soviet Union, born out of racial hatred and their Nazi past. Neither superpower was willing to allow the glory of being first in space to go to the men from Peenemunde. The effects of that conspiracy in America led directly to the election, in 1960, of John F Kennedy. His Presidential-winning platform had been built on the idea that America was losing the Space Race and that the Soviets had amassed a far greater number of long-range missile than the Americans. If the truth had been known then the course of history could have been very different. A conspiracy involving the US president aimed at Nazi scientists they had taken after WWII The compelling story of how America lost the space race Second title in an exciting new series of Conspiracy Books Author is an ex secret service agent and fluent Russian speaker	2005-07-20	Collins & Brown						ZZZ000000
9781843402923	Who's watching you?	John Gibb		In this present age of sophisticated technology, governments and their agencies have the capabilities to track citizens not only on the street (CCTV surveillance equipment is everywhere) but also in the 'privacy' of our homes (we leave a footprint whenever we use the Internet). Governments maintain this level of interference is for our own safety but many worry that the menace of 'Big Brother' as depicted by George Orwell is fast becoming reality. This book analyses the fragmentation of civil liberties in the 'Free West.' Today, US and British Governments allow imprisonment without trial and chip away at basic freedoms like trial by jury, the right to remain silent and the right to be judged solely on the evidence. The state is tightening its grip on us by watching and recording what we do because they know they can get away with it and because knowledge is power. The book is split into 11 chapters. Among the key topics covered are the prevalence of CCTV - if you work in London or any other major city in the UK you will be filmed by the State at least 300 times every day - the myriad state intelligence gathering agencies (the US alone has 41 registered), the credit rating agencies and their record of all your financial transactions, and satellite surveillance. The prevalence of government spy and surveillance networks is one of the biggest modern conspiracies Intriguing examination of the phenomenon of 'Big Brother' The third title in an exciting new series of Conspiracy Books Author is an expert in crime and military defence	2005-07-20	Collins & Brown						ZZZ000000
9781843402893	Who are the Illuminati?	Lindsay Porter		How are the origins of the French Revolution, the murder of the Romanovs, the design of the dollar bill and the Roswell UFO incident connected? The answer is one of the world's most mysterious and feared secret societies - the Illuminati. References to the Illuminati span centuries, yet reliable historical evidence is scant. This book will look at the wildly different theories about the Illuminati, examining how fears about the group have developed over time, and how these fears hold up a mirror to whatever the current anxieties of the age may be. What is known is that on 1 May 1776, at the height of the European Enlightenment, Adam Weishaupt, a professor of canon law at the University of Ingolstadt in Bavaria, founded a secret society of freethinkers, or 'enlightened ones' - the Illuminati. The group was formed to discuss and disseminate the radical philosophies of the day, and secrecy was crucial to its survival: neither church nor crown would have countenanced the group's anticlerical and antimonarchist ideas. At its height the Illuminati numbered 2,500, with members across Europe, including some of the period's leading thinkers. Yet just 12 years after the group's founding, it was disbanded by a governmental edict and the Illuminati ceased to exist. Or did it? For nearly 250 years references to the Illuminati and its alleged influence on major world events have continued to resurface. There are those who claim the Illuminati is much older than its first recorded incarnation suggests, dating its origins to the time of the Pyramids, and others who believe the group is literally not of this planet but part of an alien culture bent on taking over the earth. This book looks at the reality and the myths, questions the allegations and explores how fears about the group have taken many different forms, whether fear of intellectuals during the Enlightenment, or fear of communists during the McCarthy era. An internet search reveals that belief in the group's shadowy influence is positively thriving - what does that say about us today? And are we right to be afraid? An examination of the murky past of one of the world's oldest secret organisations Hugely topical following publication of the novel 'Angels and Demons' Fifth title in an exciting new series of Conspiracy Books Author is an expert in conspiracy theories and secret societies	2005-10-10	Collins & Brown						ZZZ000000

9781843402992	Where Were You When	Ian Harrison		Where were you on September 11th or when you first heard of Kennedy's assassination? Where were you when you heard of Mandela's release, the conquest of Everest or Martin Luther King's Dream? What did you do for the Millennium? What were you doing during Concorde's last flights or when Dylan went electric? Where were you when the Berlin Wall fell or when the Pope died? How did you hear about John Lennon's death and where were you when the last ever episode of Friends was televised? These are just some the events that have shaped our world, key moments in history that have associations for all of us. ''Where Were You When...?' is an exhilarating book of more than one hundred such events that are within living memory. Arranged chronologically, the book kicks off in 1939 with the declaration of World War II. It covers a broad range of subjects from science politics, war, sport and popular culture. Ian Harrison's lively and informative text is accompanied by iconic, instantly recognizable images, as well as lesser-known photographs that the reader may not have seen before.

9781843402879	Conspiracy Encyclopedia	Thom Burnett		Conspiracies are everywhere. They are the lifeblood of politics, business and our daily lives. This truly international and all-embracing encyclopedia explains the details of the world's major popular conspiracies, listing them chronologically under subject matter and cross-referencing them continually (because so many conspiracy theories interact on some level). Conspiracies are often international in their sweep and their impact. The brutal stabbing of Julius Caesar (the conspiracy which has defined political assassinations ever since) plunged the Roman Empire into civil war, which then engulfed much of the known western world. More recently the Cambridge spies (Philby, Blunt, MacLean and Burgess) helped Russia throughout WWII and then re-defined the Cold War afterwards, Philby's defection casting a 30-year shadow over CIA/Anglo-American relations. Though conspiracies define our everyday lives, there is no body of serious academic research to understand their role, nature or defining characteristics. Most historians prefer to adhere to the cock-up theory of history, in which everything happens by accident or incompetence. Although this view is favoured by academics and historians, it is rejected by a large part of the general public who prefer the evidence of their own lives. However they consume their media, what they see is a mesh of conspiracies that define the texture of their everyday lives, often for the worst. Most people believe that there is a grain of truth in most theories about conspiracies. This book is for them.

9780762415922	Ticket to ride,inside the Beatles' 1964 tour that changed the world	Larry Kane		It was 40 years ago -- more or less -- that a 22year-old broadcast journalist from Florida was invited by manager Brian Epstein to travel with the Beatles to every stop on their first North American tours. The only American reporter in the official press party, Larry Kane obtained exclusive, revealing interviews with John, Paul, George, and Ringo. Fortunately, Kane saved his original notes and tapes, and shares them here for the first time. That material provides the basis for his intimate look back at the phenomenon of the Fab Four, and insights into the humor and personality of each group member. "Ticket to Ride," illustrated with more than 30 photographs, captures a rare time in history, gracefully melding the story of the Beatles revolution with the changing tenor of the country. Hear John Lennon's early public criticism of the Vietnam War, and learn about the night the Beatles met Bob Dylan. "We had a crazy party the night we met [Dylan]," Paul recounts. I thought I got the meaning to life that night. "Ticket to Ride" includes a 60minute audio CD featuring rare interviews.	2003-07-13	Running Press						ZZZ000000

9781845294274	Muhajababes,meet the new Middle East - cool, sexy and devout	Allegra Stratton		Two thirds of the population in the Middle East are under 25 years old and, though more of them than ever have university degrees, there aren't enough jobs to go round. They're having a collective quarter-life crisis. In the months before turning 25 herself, Allegra Stratton set out to meet them. All of them. This is the account of her journey to Beirut, Amman, Cairo, Dubai, Kuwait City and Damascus moving with the Middle Eastern ripple of change: Iraq's first post-Saddam elections, Lebanon's Cedar Revolution, Mubarak's decision to hold multi-candidate elections and Kuwait giving women the vote. Prodding and probing, she acquires a taste for rehashed hip hop, gets locked into a painter's studio, sits at the back of Pop Idol auditions and in the wrong seats at a football match. She saves a young businesswoman from a fatal spelling mistake and meets the region's most famous single mother. What she is determined not to do is ask patronising questions about the headscarf. But then she meets the Muhajababes. With their black sheer headscarves worn with tight clothes, high heels and make up, these young women are repackaging Islam for their generation and saying it's OK to be sexy, cool and devout. Visiting mosques, the offices of EMI Arabia and university campuses, Allegra finds out what's really going on on Arab Street.	2006-07-27	Constable						ZZZ000000
9781845294649	Flight 93 revealed,what really happened on the 9/11 "Let's roll" flight?	Rowland Morgan		Flight 93 became the 9/11 heroic legend that inspired America and produced the Pentagon's `Let's Roll' recruitment slogan for the Iraq invasion. The brave passenger revolt was the drama that powered its war effort. It has been the subject of three feature films, three bestselling books and numerous TV documentaries. But how much of the legend is truth, how much wishful thinking or even raw propaganda aimed at whipping up public support for war? Morgan asks key questions like: - why didn't the air force intervene? This flight was the last of the 9/11 series and would have been on the radar in time - confusion over the identity of the hijackers? Two named were later said to be still alive - the 9/11 Commission says phones were used, and Flight 93 passengers are said to have heard what happened to the otherplanes via cellphones - but cellphones don't work at normal altitude, so is this really possible? - are there two cockpit voice recordings? The relatives seem to have heard one version, the 9/11 commission another.	2006-08-24	Constable & Robinson						ZZZ000000

9781845293734	Fallujah,eyewitness testimony from Iraq's besieged city	Jonathan Holmes		The play Fallujah, written by Jonathan Holmes, starring Samantha Morton and with a score by Nitin Sawhney, is this year's Guantanamo. In this extraordinary sourcebook, Holmes gathers together the testimony that formed the basis of his verbatim script, and which came from Iraqi civilians, NGOs, politicians, US and UK military, and journalists involved in the three attacks on Fallujah. It makes a strong case - using unpublished evidence collected by Nobel Peace Prize-nominee Dr Scilla Elworthy of Peace Direct - that the US military should be hauled up before the ICC for war crimes. The documentary sources establish the facts that shaped the play's fictional form, while a new essay by Scilla Elworthy sets out the case behind the research and reveals the truth of the atrocities carried out by the USA.	2007-04-01	Constable						ZZZ000000
9781845291396	Big pharma,how the world's biggest drug companies control illness	Jacky Law		Pharmaceutical medicine is very, very big business. The top ten players earned more than $200 billion in 2003. One drug, Pfizer's cholesterol pill Lipitor, had sales of more than $9 billion. This kind of money buys an awful lot of friends among doctors and politicians. Most of those involved in the formulation of public health policy seems happy with the present system. The trouble is that the public is starting to have doubts. There is a growing sense that the vast profits of drug companies and their control of the research agenda might not be that good for our health. Jacky Law takes the reader on a journey through the pharmaceutical business and shows how the public is quite right to be concerned about conventional medicine as it has developed since the late 1970s. She tells a story of spectacular regulatory failure, phenomenally high prices, betrayal of the public interest and a growing awareness among ordinary people that things could be very different. Sophisticated marketing and public relations, not scientific excellence, have helped corporations to preside unchallenged over matters of life and death. It is time, Law argues, for us to take responsibility for our health, not as passive consumers of pharmaceutical medicine, but as informed citizens.	2006	Constable						ZZZ000000
9781841199009	What the media are doing to our politics	John Lloyd		Nothing more grimly highlights the terrible state of relations between the British press and the Government than the autumn 2003 Hutton Inquiry into the tragic death of weapons expert David Kelly. Indeed, as John Lloyd argues in this timely and deeply controversial book, the media are now no longer functioning as an inquiring check on the excesses of the political class. Instead they have become an alternative establishment, one supremely dedicated to a theatrical distrust of individual politicians and a furious and calculated indifference to the real-life intricacies of world policy-making. That the media have emerged today as a powerful and largely unaccountable force in British public life is undeniable. But here Lloyd takes things further and puts forward the case, persuasively and aggressively, that the composition and background of the media elite, and the growing emphasis on profit in the companies for which they work, have created an idol that takes as its sacrifice justice and balance, and deprives the public of the information they need in order to act as responsible citizens.	2004	Constable						ZZZ000000
9780552149778	Before we were thirty	Katie Agnew		This magical tale of love and friendship centres around the tiny, but exclusive, village of Combe which is situated six miles from Bath and largely inhabited by ageing millionaires who enjoy hunting, shooting, fishing, bitching about each other and playing bridge. In other words the village is not so much a sleepy backwater (as the estate agent calls it) but is actually in a coma. In this village live four frustrated young women - RACHEL (whose marriage is in crisis as she tries to cope with motherhood and country life after leaving her glamorous London PR job), HARRIET (bright, bitchy, aristocratic supermodel who once ruled the catwalk in the early nineties but now has no outlet for her talents), BIANCA (pretty, sunshiney, blonde ex-glamour model who married an eighties pop legend, and isn't as dumb as people assume she is) and elusive Summer (single mother, with a hippy wardrobe who keeps herself to herself, has no money and a big secret). When a sexy, enigmatic young millionaire, Jack, arrives in Combe and throws a massive party for all the villagers, everything starts to change. Rumours abound - Where did he come from? What does he do? How did he make his money? Drugs? Human trafficking? Prostitution? The villagers are intrigued, and the four young women are particularly drawn to him, and to each other, despite their differences. And he, in turn, transforms their lives...	2004-10-01	Corgi						ZZZ000000

9780552216692	Afghan Campaign	Steven Pressfield		Alexander the Great s campaign in the Afghan kingdoms began in the summer of 330BC. It lasted for three brutal years and proved the most difficult he and his army ever fought... The Afghan Campaign recounts the story of this bloody and ruthless conflict from the perspective of a Macedonian recruit. The youngest of three brothers and eager to prove himself, Matthias has volunteered for Alexander's ambitious expedition into the unknown, unconquered country we now call Afghanistan. But as Matthias joins the frontline, he begins to realise that the nature of warfare for which he trained has changed. The Macedonians face a new kind of enemy and must learn to fight a new kind of war. Experiencing fear, euphoria, horror and shame, Matthias and his comrades undergo a rite of passage as they, soldiers of a Western force whose code was secular and humanist, struggle to subjugate a fiercely proud Eastern warrior nation of deeply-held beliefs and a fervent willingness to die for their cause. Simply to survive, Alexander s men must shake off the trappings of civilization as they know it and adopt the same unorthodox and barbaric tactics as their foe but at what cost? Set against the imposing, alien implacability of the Afghan landscape, this powerfully affecting, thrillingly-told novel not only demonstrates its author's profound understanding of the hopes and fears of men in battle but also has some important things to say about the nature of wars past and present.	2008-01-28	Bantam Paperbacks						ZZZ000000

9780517704622	Tropical houses,living in nature in Jamaica, Sri Lanka, Java, Bali, and the coasts of Mexico and Belize	Tim Street-Porter		The ambient warmth of the tropics causes architectural distinctions between indoors and out to evaporate, along with the walls that divide them. Houses expand into the landscape, while the sights, sounds, and scents of nature waft through living spaces. Indeed, one of the pleasures of living in the tropics is an awakening of the senses that brings us closer to nature.Internationally renowned photographer and writer Tim Street-Porter has spent more than ten years traveling through Bali, Java, Sri Lanka, Mexico, Belize, and Jamaica. This book's 272 stunning photographs, supported by Street-Porter's fascinating and informed commentary, capture the appeal and the meaning of the enviable dwellings he found in his journeys. It may be the outdoor bath, a sybarite's delight, with sun filtering through a frangipani tree . . . the deep-eaved verandah, where one sips coffee while contemplating the neighboring valley shrouded in early morning mist . . . or the thatch-roofed palapa, its main supports local tree trunks wrapped in strangler vine.These wonderful expressions of vernacular architecture -- many the products of the world's finest architects and designers--nest in jungles, perch over volcanic cliffs, stand placidly beside lagoons, and exist always in harmony with the nature that envelops them. These are real places where people really live, but each seems suspended in a setting that is at once dreamlike and elemental.	2000-11-07	Clarkson Potter						ZZZ000000

9780786716517	The Return of the Black Widowers	Isaac Asimov&Charles Ardai&Harlan Ellison		Until his death in 1992, author Isaac Asimov would write more than 120 ingenious tales of detection and deduction, and in 66 of them he would present his armchair detectives, the Black Widowers, with the mind-teasing puzzles that they would strive to solve in often-quarrelsome conversation. The Black Widowers club is meeting again. In a private dining room at New York's luxurious Milano restaurant, the six brilliant men once more gather for fine fare served impeccably by their peerless waiter, Henry. At table, too, will of course be that requisite dinner guest to challenge their combined deductive wit: a man whose marriage hinges on finding a lost umbrella; a woman shadowed by an adversary who knows her darkest secrets; a debunker of psychics unable to explain his unnerving experience in a haunted house; or a symphony cellist accused of attacking his wife with a kitchen knife. In addition to six stories that have never before appeared in any collection, this volume includes the ten best-ever Black Widowers cases, among them the very first to be published, in Ellery Queen Mystery Magazine, as well as the first brand new Black Widowers story to appear in more than ten years.	2005-11-09	Carroll & Graf Publishers						ZZZ000000

9780786715268	Man of letters,the extraordinary life and times of literary impresario Rupert Hart-Davis	Philip Ziegler		Rupert Hart-Davis was the quintessential man of letters, standing at the heart of twentieth-century Britain's storied literary and cultural scenes. He is, perhaps, most famous for his best-selling six volume collection of correspondence with mentor George Lyttelton, though the Hart-Davis/Lyttelton letters only scratch the surface of a truly fascinating life. From Sir Laurence Olivier and ex-wife Countess Dame Peggy Ashcroft to T. S. Eliot, Paul Robeson, and Somerset Maugham; Rupert Hart-Davis not only knew everyone, but also edited or published nearly everyone in one of the livelier lives of the mind on record. Tracing the entirety of Hart-Davis's life, which spanned almost all of the twentieth century, Philip Ziegler, acclaimed biographer of poet Osbert Sitwell, offers a delightfully entertaining biography intended for anyone interested in the goings-on of cultural and artistic circles. From literature to academia to the stage and screen, Rupert Hart-Davis was a cultural bon vivant and as genuinely fascinating a figure as the celebrities who surrounded him. Man of Letters is not only the portrait of a quintessential and star-studded twentieth-century life of letters, but of a way of living that will never be seen again.	2005-05-10	Carroll & Graf Publishers						ZZZ000000

9781560252740	Nirvana,the day-by-day eyewitness chronicle	Carrie Borzillo		This chronological oral history of the noisy career of Nirvana takes readers from Kurt Cobain's first meeting with Kris Novoselic in the rural Washington logging town where they grew up through the superstardom that followed the release of Nevermind; to the mourning of the tragic suicide of front-man Kurt Cobain. In 1988, indie record label Sub-Pop signed the band and changed rock history. Aggressive yet melodic, poppy yet muddy, with enigmatic but engaging lyrics, Nirvana broadcasted a message of disaffection, isolation, and anger to a group of American kids whose ears were suddenly open. Listening to Nirvana, kids were simultaneously introduced to Punk Rock and everything it stood for. A once marginal quarter of rock music was now in the hands of everybody, and alternative music ruled the airwaves under the guise of Seattle "Grunge." Featuring new and exclusive interviews and quotes from newspapers, magazines, books, television and radio documentaries, and Internet sites, Carrie Borzilla has woven the testimony of those who were there into a complete exploration of Nirvana and the short, unhappy life of Kurt Cobain.	2000-10-04	Da Capo Press						ZZZ000000

9780375405280	You're an animal, Viskovitz!	Alessandro Boffa&John Casey&Maria Sanminiatelli		From Italy, a wildly modern riff on Ovid'sMetamorphosesa whirlwind of ironic fables in which the central hero, Viskovitz, continually changes identities in pursuit of his one true love. A snail with two sexes, a parrot who speaks of love, a dormouse who has erotic dreams, a police dog who's a Buddhist, a microbe with an inferiority complex, a lion in love with a gazelle, a chameleon hoping to find himself, an intestinal worm, a dung beetle . . . Viskovitz is each of these animals and many more, possessed by their behaviors, their neuroses, their vanities. And the gorgeous and impossible Ljuba, the object of Viskovitz's desire, is in turn a sow, a bitch, a gazelle. There is an animal passion between them that lasts from story to story, but it is the fullness of the human condition that is portrayed most vividly in these hilarious metamorphoses. Dazzling beginnings lead into plots full of surprises, ranging from slapstick to Western, from cautionary tale to thriller. Scientific jargon is turned into wordplay and witty aphorism; theatrical reversals and philosophical insights abound. You're an Animal, Viskovitz!is a triumph of comic inventiveness and intelligence unlike anything we've seen before.	2002-05-21	Random House, Inc.						ZZZ000000
9780151010905	The facts behind the Helsinki Roccamatios	Yann Martel		Here are four unforgettable stories by the author of Life of Pi. In the exquisite title novella, a very young man dying of AIDS joins his friend in fashioning a story of the Roccamatio family of Helsinki, set against the yearly march of the twentieth century whose horrors and miracles their story echoes. In "The Time I Heard the Private Donald J. Rankin String Concerto with One Discordant Violin, by the American composer John Morton," a Canadian university student visits Washington, D.C., and experiences the Vietnam War and its aftermath through an intense musical encounter. In "Manners of Dying," variations of a warden's letter to the mother of a son he has just executed reveal how each life is contained in its end. The final story, "The Mirror Machine", is about a young man who discovers an antique mirror-making machine in his grandmother's attic. The man's fascination with the object is juxtaposed with the longwinded reminiscences it evokes from his grandmother. Written earlier in Martel's career, these tales are as moving as they are thought-provoking, as inventive in form as they are timeless in content. They display that startling mix of dazzle and depth that have made Yann Martel an international phenomenon.	2004	Harcourt						ZZZ000000
9780060545642	My invented country,a nostalgic journey through Chile	Isabel Allende&Margaret Sayers Peden		Isabel Allende's first memory of Chile is of a house she never knew. The "large old house" on the Calle Cueto, where her mother was born and which her grandfather evoked so frequently that Isabel felt as if she had lived there, became the protagonist of her first novel, The House of the Spirits. It appears again at the beginning of Allende's playful, seductively compelling memoir My Invented Country, and leads us into this gifted writer's world. Here are the almost mythic figures of a Chilean family -- grandparents and great-grandparents, aunts, uncles, and friends -- with whom readers of Allende's fiction will feel immediately at home. And here, too, is an unforgettable portrait of a charming, idiosyncratic Chilean people with a violent history and an indomitable spirit. Although she claims to have been an outsider in her native land -- "I never fit in anywhere, not into my family, my social class, or the religion fate bestowed on me" -- Isabel Allende carries with her even today the mark of the politics, myth, and magic of her homeland. In My Invented County, she explores the role of memory and nostalgia in shaping her life, her books, and that most intimate connection to her place of origin.Two life-altering events inflect the peripatetic narration of this book: The military coup and violent death of her uncle, Salvador Allende Gossens, on September 11, 1973, sent her into exile and transformed her into a writer. The terrorist attack of September 11, 2001, on her newly adopted homeland, the United States, brought forth from Allende an overdue acknowledgment that she had indeed left home. My Invented Country, whose structure mimics the workings of memory itself, ranges back and forth across that distance accrued between the author's past and present lives. It speaks compellingly to immigrants, and to all of us, who try to retain a coherent inner life in a world full of contradictions.	2003-05-15	HarperCollins						ZZZ000000

The story seamlessly weaves through the surreal and the painfully factual, guided by the careful, somber colors and inventive pacing unique to Hornschmeier's storytelling. Mother, Come Home extracts almost tangible drama from the most tranquil of moments, making that which is unspoken in each panel easily audible, and almost uncomfortably experienced.	2004-02-04	Dark Horse Comics						CGN000000

9780385611220	Gorilla City,the first amazing, astonishing, incredible and true adventures of me! (Charlie Small).	Charlie Small&Nick Ward		No one knows the full story of Charlie Small. At least, not yet. His battered journal was found washed up on a remote, windswept shore. And at first we thought it an elaborate hoax. Surely no eight-year-old could have had so many wild adventures, witnessed so many extraordinary things, lived such an incredible life - and still only be eight. And yet ... there was something so vivid in the telling, that we were persuaded, just enough, to send the journal and some of its boggling content for analysis. The results were absolutely astonishing. And only one conclusion could be drawn. Everything in the journal of Charlie Small is true. He really has wrestled a deadly river croc, ridden a steam-powered rhino, been cabin boy for a band of desperate lady-pirates and tribal chief in a city of gorillas. And countless other things besides. And ... not only that ... even though Charlie Small is only eight, he must have lived for over six hundred years! It's possible that he's still out there, somewhere. Having even more incredible adventures in some remote part of the world. In fact ... word has recently reached us of a second journal, found encased in ice, high in the Himalayas. If we can get the pages thawed, and its authenticity can be verified, we plan to publish that account, too. So ... if you ever come across a curious-looking diary, filled with astounding adventures, or a boy who seems to have lost his way, but is a dab hand with a cutlass, please do contact us. We're eager for more. And we know the world will be, too.	2007-03-01	David Fickling Books						ZZZ000000

He also embarked on his greatest teaching adventure: sharing his evolving knowledge of living while dying.With warmth, wisdom, and humor, Morrie reveals how to:-- live fully in the moment-- tap into the powers of the mind to transcend physical limitations-- grieve for your losses-- reach out to family and friends-- develop an inner space for meditation and spiritual connection. It's never too late to become the kind of person you'd like to be.

In 1995 Nightline ran three interviews in which Ted Koppel spoke to Morrie about life, death and the disease that was afflicting his body.

9780385500609	The Reenchantment of Nature,The Denial of Religion and the Ecological Crisis	Alister E. McGrath		In this provocative assessment of the world's current ecological crisis, the author of the critically acclaimedIn the Beginningexposes the false assumptions underlying the conflicts between science and religion, and proposes an innovative approach to saving the planet. Traditionally, science and religion have been thought of as two distinct and irreconcilable ways of looking at the world, and scientists have often chastised the world's religions for keeping their eyes on the heavens and paying scant attention to the destruction of Earth's precious resources and its natural wonders. InThe Reenchantment of Nature, Alister McGrath, who holds doctorates in both molecular biology and divinity, challenges this long-held and dangerously misguided dichotomy. Arguing that Christianity and other great religions have always respected and revered the bounty and beauty of the earth, McGrath calls for a radical shift in perspective. He shows that by defining the world in the narrowest of scientific terms and viewing it as a collection of atoms and molecules governed by unchanging laws and forces, we have lost our ability to appreciate nature's enchantments. In order to address the threats to our environment, he maintains, it is essential to reawaken our sense of awe and look at the world as a glorious creation, an irreplaceable gift of God. In setting forth a new framework for the debate between science and religion on ecological theory,The Reenchantment of Naturepoints the way to integrating two different traditions in a sane and productive effort to rescue the natural world from its present environmental decline.

9780385510011	The swallows of Kabul	Yasmina Khadra&John Cullen		Set in Kabul under the rule of the Taliban, this extraordinary novel takes readers into the lives of two couples: Mohsen, who comes from a family of wealthy shopkeepers whom the Taliban has destroyed; Zunaira, his wife, exceedingly beautiful, who was once a brilliant teacher and is now no longer allowed to leave her home without an escort or covering her face. Intersecting their world is Atiq, a prison keeper, a man who has sincerely adopted the Taliban ideology and struggles to keep his faith, and his wife, Musarrat, who once rescued Atiq and is now dying of sickness and despair. Desperate, exhausted Mohsen wanders through Kabul when he is surrounded by a crowd about to stone an adulterous woman. Numbed by the hysterical atmosphere and drawn into their rage, he too throws stones at the face of the condemned woman buried up to her waist. With this gesture the lives of all four protagonists move toward their destinies.The Swallows of Kabul is a dazzling novel written with compassion and exquisite detail by one of the most lucid writers about the mentality of Islamic fundamentalists and the complexities of the Muslim world. Yasmina Khadra brings readers into the hot, dusty streets of Kabul and offers them an unflinching but compassionate insight into a society that violence and hypocrisy have brought to the edge of despair.	2004-02-17	Nan A.

9780385517485	The attack	Yasmina Khadra&John Cullen		Dr. Amin Jaafari, an Arab-Israeli citizen, is a surgeon at a hospital in Tel Aviv. Dedicated to his work, respected and admired by his colleagues and community, he represents integration at its most successful. He has learned to live with the violence and chaos that plague his city, and on the night of a deadly bombing in a local restaurant, he works tirelessly to help the shocked and shattered patients brought to the emergency room. But this night of turmoil and death takes a horrifyingly personal turn. His wife's body is found among the dead, with massive injuries, the police coldly announce, typical of those found on the bodies of fundamentalist suicide bombers. As evidence mounts that his wife, Sihem, was responsible for the catastrophic bombing, Dr. Jaafari is torn between cherished memories of their years together and the inescapable realization that the beautiful, intelligent, thoroughly modern woman he loved had a life far removed from the comfortable, assimilated existence they shared. From the graphic, beautifully rendered description of the bombing that opens the novel to the searing conclusion,The Attackportrays the reality of terrorism and its incalculable spiritual costs. Intense and humane, devoid of political bias, hatred, and polemics, it probes deep inside the Muslim world and gives readers a profound understanding of what seems impossible to understand.	2005	Nan A.

9780385520300	Opus Dei	John L. Allen		The first serious journalistic investigation of the highly secretive, controversial organization Opus Dei provides unique insight about the wild rumors surrounding it and discloses its significant influence in the Vatican and on the politics of the Catholic Church. Opus Dei (literally "the work of God") is an international association of Catholics often labeled as conservative who seek personal Christian perfection and strive to implement Christian ideals in their jobs and in society as a whole. It has been accused of promoting a right-wing political agenda and of cultlike practices. Its notoriety escalated with the publication of the runaway bestseller The Da Vinci Code (Opus Dei plays an important and sinister role in the novel). With the expert eye of a longtime observer of the Vatican and the skill of an investigative reporter intent on uncovering closely guarded secrets, John Allen finally separates the myths from the facts.--From publisher description.	2006-08	Doubleday						ZZZ000000
9780385514590	A commonwealth of thieves,the improbable birth of Australia	Thomas Keneally		Drawing on historical documents and journals, with the authority of a historian and the narrative grace of a novelist, Keneally recounts the founding of the first penal colony in Australia in 1788. At the center of the story is Arthur Phillips, an ambitious captain in the Royal Navy assigned the formidable task of organizing the expedition to Australia and establishing a colony comprised mainly of unskilled and malcontent criminals and petty thieves, many determined to overcome their pasts and begin anew. Keneally re-creates the grueling overseas voyage, a hellish journey that claimed many lives. As governor, Phillips took on the challenges of dealing with unruly convicts, disgruntled officers, a bewildered, sometimes hostile native population, as well as such serious matters as food shortages and disease. In the end Phillips emerges as a governor driven by a yearning for recognition and advancement, yet possessed of a social conscience rare for his time.--From publisher description.	2006-10-03	Nan A.

9780385510233	The Middle Sea,a history of the Mediterranean	John Julius Norwich		A one-volume narrative history of the Mediterranean from Ancient Egypt to 1919. Written in the racy, readable prose for which author Norwich is famous, this is colorful, character-driven history. He tackles a vast subject--vast in time, from the oldest surviving pyramid to the First World War; vast in geography, from Gibraltar to Jerusalem; and vast in culture, including as it does the civilizations of the Phoenicians, the Egyptians, Greece, Carthage, Rome and Byzantium, the Borgias and the Medicis, Muhammad and El Cid, Napoleon and Nelson, Moslems, Jews and Christians. This book is not a dry record of facts; it is a rackety read about historical figures--dissolute popes and wily emperors, noble-hearted generals and beautiful princesses. Towns are besieged and sacked, kingdoms won and lost. The narrative covers the glories of Constantinople and Venice, and the stirring history of the islands of Malta, Sicily, Crete and Cyprus.--From publisher description.	2006-11-07	Random House, Inc.

9780385517218	Point to point navigation,a memoir, 1964 to 2006	Gore Vidal		The brilliant sequel to Gore Vidal's acclaimed, bestselling memoir,Palimpsest. InPoint to Point Navigation, the celebrated novelist, essayist, critic, and controversialist Gore Vidal ranges freely over his remarkable life with the signature wit and literary elegance that is uniquely his. The title refers to a form of navigation he resorted to as a first mate in the Navy during World War II. As he says, "As I was writing this account of my life and times sincePalimpsest, I felt as if I were again dealing with those capes and rocks in the Bering Sea that we had to navigate so often with a compass made inoperable by weather." It is a beautifully apt analogy for the hazards (mostly) eluded during his eventful life and for the way this memoir proceedsfar from linear but always on course. From his desks in Ravello and the Hollywood Hills, Gore Vidal travels in memory through the arenas of literature, television, film, theater, politics and international society where he has cut a broad swath, recounting achievements and defeats, friends and enemies made (and on a number of occasions lost). Among the gathering of notables to be found in these pages, sketched with a draftsman's ease and evoked with the panache of one of our great raconteurs, are Jack and Jacqueline Kennedy, Tennessee Williams (the "Glorious Bird"), Eleanor Roosevelt, Orson Welles, Johnny Carson, Greta Garbo, Federico Fellini, Rudolph Nureyev, Elia Kazan, and Francis Ford Coppola. Some of the book's most moving pages are devoted to the illness and death of his partner of five decades, Howard Austen, and indeed the book is, among other things, a meditation on mortality written in the spirit of Montaigne. Elegiac yet vital and even ornery,Point to Point Navigationis a summing-up of Gore Vidal's time on the planet that manages to be at once supremely entertaining, endlessly provocative, and thoroughly moving.	2006	Random House, Inc.

9780385510127	The enemy at home,the cultural left and its responsibility for 9/11	Dinesh D'Souza		The culture wars at home and the global war on terror are usually viewed as separate problems. Author D'Souza makes the claim that terrorist acts around the world can be directly traced to the ideas and attitudes perpetrated by America's cultural left. D'Souza shows that American liberals are responsible for fostering a culture that angers and repulses not just Muslims but also traditional and religious societies around the world. He argues that it is not our exercise of freedom that enrages our enemies, but our abuse of that freedom--from the sexual liberty of women to the support of gay marriage, birth control, and no-fault divorce, to the aggressive exportation of our vulgar, licentious popular culture. It is only by curtailing the left's attacks on religion, family, and traditional values that we can persuade moderate Muslims and others around the world to cooperate with us and shun the extremists in their own countries.--From publisher description	2007	Random House, Inc.

9780385514453	Legacy of ashes,the history of the CIA	Tim Weiner		Here is the hidden history of the CIA: why eleven presidents and three generations of CIA officers have been unable to understand the world; why nearly every CIA director has left the agency in worse shape than he found it; and how these failures have profoundly jeopardized our national security. For sixty years, the CIA has managed to maintain a formidable reputation in spite of its terrible record, burying its blunders in top-secret archives. Its mission was to know the world--when it did not succeed, it set out to change the world instead. Now Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Weiner offers the first definitive history of the CIA, based on more than 50,000 documents, primarily from the archives of the CIA itself, and hundreds of interviews with CIA veterans, including ten Directors of Central Intelligence.--From publisher description.	2007	Random House, Inc.

9780385516402	The nine,inside the secret world of the Supreme Court	Jeffrey Toobin		As the Supreme Court continues to rule on important issues, it is essential to understand how it operates. Based on exclusive interviews with the justices themselves and other insiders, this is a timely "state of the union" about America's most elite legal institution. From Anthony Kennedy's self-importance, to Antonin Scalia's combativeness, to David Souter's eccentricity, and even Sandra Day O'Connor's fateful breach with President George W. Bush, this book offers a rare personal look at how the individual style of each justice affects the way in which they wield their considerable power. Toobin shows how--since Reagan--conservatives were long thwarted in their attempts to control the Court by some of the very justices they pressured Presidents to appoint. That struggle ended with the recent appointments of John Roberts and Samuel Alito, and Toobin relays the behind-the-scenes drama in detail, as well as the ensuing 2007 Court term.--From publisher description.	2007	Random House, Inc.

But the life he found on the far-off planet of S?o Paulo was no better than the one he had abandoned. Tough, volatile, and angry-a luckless prospector hoping for that one rich strike that will make him wealthy-Ramon is content only when on his own out in the bush, far from the dirty, loud, bustling hive of humanity that he detests with sociopathic fervor. Then one night his rage and too much alcohol get the better of him, resulting in sudden bloodshed and a high-profile murder. Ramon is forced to flee into the wilderness for however long it will take for the furor to die down. Here, mercifully, almost happily alone, Ramon is once again free. But while searching for his long-elusive lode, he stumbles upon something completely unexpected: a highly advanced alien race in hiding; fugitives like himself on a world not their own. Suddenly in possession of a powerful, dangerous secret, Ramon must battle for his freedom from alien captors and also against the hostile and unpredictable planet. And so the chase begins. Police, fugitive aliens, and a human murderer weave a web of shifting alliances as Ramon enters the greatest manhunt the alien world of S?o Paulo has ever known. If he is to survive, Ramon must overcome inscrutable aliens and deadly predators, but his greatest enemy is himself. With every move in the desperate game, he struggles to outwit his enemies and solve the mystery of a murder he himself committed. A rip-roaring adventure tale and character study of a fascinating and twisted mind, Hunter's Run showcases three masters of the form at their best.	2008-01-03	Eos						ZZZ000000

Determined to save her family from starvation in the face of marauding Gnez troops, Ludmila's journey into the world and womanhood is an odyssey of sour wit, even sourer vodka, and a Soviet tractor probably running on goat's piss. Thousands of miles to the West, the Heath twins are separated after 33 years conjoined at the abdomen. Released for the first time from an institution rumoured to have been founded for an illegitimate child of Charles II, they are suddenly plunged into a round-the-clock world churning with opportunity, rowdy with the chatter of freedom, democracy, self-empowerment and sex. A wild and raucous picaresque dripping with flavours of British bacon and nasty Russian vodka, Ludmila's Broken English is a tale of tango-ing twins on a journey into the unknown. A ride so outrageously improbable it just may happen, DBC Pierre's second novel confirms his place in the ranks of today's most original storytellers.	2006-01-01	Faber						ZZZ000000
9781846680496	The uncommon reader	Alan Bennett		What would happen if the Queen became a reader of taste and discernment rather than of Dick Francis? The answer is a perfect story.The Uncommon Reader is none other than HM the Queen who drifts accidentally into reading when her corgis stray into a mobile library parked at Buckingham Palace. She reads widely ( JR Ackerley, Jean Genet, Ivy Compton Burnett and the classics) and intelligently. Her reading naturally changes her world view and her relationship with people like the oleaginous prime minister and his repellent advisers. She comes to question the prescribed order of the world and loses patience with much that she has to do. In short, her reading is subversive. The consequence is, of course, surprising, mildly shocking and very funny.	2007	Faber and Faber						ZZZ000000
9780571211081	Kubrick,The Definitive Edition	Michel Ciment&Gilbert Adair&Robert Bononno		With a new Introduction by Martin Scorsese.If Stanley Kubrick had made only 2001: A Space Odyssey or Dr. Strangelove, his cinematic legacy would have been assured. But from his first feature film, Fear and Desire, to the posthumously released Eyes Wide Shut, Kubrick created an accomplished body of work unique in its scope, diversity, and artistry, and by turns both lauded and controversial.In this newly revised and definitive edition of his now classic study, film critic Michel Ciment provides an insightful examination of Kubrick's thirteen films--including such favorites as Lolita, A Clockwork Orange, and Full Metal Jacket--alongside an assemblage of more than four hundred photographs that form a complementary photo essay. Rounding out this unique work are a short biography of Kubrick; interviews with the director, as well as cast and crew members, including Malcolm McDowell, Shelley Duvall, and Jack Nicholson; and a detailed filmography and bibliography. Meshed with masterful integrity, the book's text and illustrations pay homage to one of the most visionary, original, and demanding filmmakers of our time.	2003-09-18	Macmillan						ZZZ000000

9780374530242	Curzon,Imperial Statesman	David Gilmour		"Elegant biography . . . a fast-moving, entertaining, and finely written story." --Simon Schama, " The New Yorker" George Nathaniel Curzon's controversial life in public service stretched from the high noon of his country's empire to the traumatized years following World War I. As viceroy of India under Queen Victoria and foreign secretary under King George V, the obsessive Lord Curzon left his unmistakable mark on the era. David Gilmour's award-winning book is a brilliant assessment of Curzon's character and achievements, offering a richly dramatic account of the infamous long vendettas, the turbulent friendships, and the passionate, risky love affairs that complicated and enriched his life. Born into the ruling class of what was then the world's greatest power, Curzon was a fervent believer in British imperialism who spent his life proving he was fit for the task. Often seen as arrogant and tempestuous, he was loathed as much as he was adored, his work disparaged as much as it was admired. In Gilmour's well-rounded appraisal, Curzon is seen as a complex, tragic figure, a gifted leader who saw his imperial world overshadowed at the dawn of democracy. David Gilmour is the author of several acclaimed works of literary and political history, including "The Long Recessional": "The Imperial Life of Rudyard Kipling" and "The Last Leopard": "A Life of Giuseppe di Lampedusa." A fellow of the Royal Society of Literature and a former fellow of St. Anthony's College, Oxford, he is a regular contributor to the "Financial Times" and "The New York Review of Books." He lives in Edinburgh.  Winner of the Duff Cooper PrizeA "Los Angeles Times" Best BookA "San Francisco Chronicle" Best BookA "Booklist "Editors' Choice George Nathaniel Curzon's controversial life in public service stretched from the high noon of his country's empire to the traumatized years following the First World War. As viceroy of India under Queen Victoria and foreign secretary under King George V, the obsessive and tempestuous Lord Curzon left his unmistakable mark on the era. David Gilmour's award-winning and masterful book--now with a new foreword by the author--is a brilliant assessment of Curzon's character and achievements, offering a dramatic account not only of a remarkable public career but also of a turbulent private life, with its infamous vendettas, many long friendships, and passionate, risky love affairs. Born into the ruling class of what was then the world's greatest power, Curzon was a fervent believer in British imperialism who spent his life proving he was fit for the task. His prodigious energy made him the most traveled minister ever to sit in a British cabinet, a writer of immense volumes on Asia, and a compulsive restorer of ancient buildings in Britain and India. Often seen as arrogant and pompous, Curzon was loathed as much as he was adored, his work disparaged as much as it was admired. In Gilmour's work, he emerges as a complex, contradictory figure, a man of great talents and glaring defects whose career was a spectacular blend of triumph and disappointment. "[A] superb biography."--Ian Buruma, "The New York Review of Books" "David Gilmour makes it clear that his aim is to rescue Curzon from his critics. A person's lack of manners, he argues, should not condemn him to perpetual derision. Curzon was undoubtedly annoying, but he also restored India's greatest monuments; rationalized its police; reformed its currency, universities, and railways; and reorganized its irrigation system. There is no question that he deserves a fresh appraisal, and in Gilmour, the author of a biography of Rudyard Kipling, he has a willing and an able champion . . . Gilmour shows how different the real Curzon was from the pampered caricature . . . "Curzon: Imperial Statesman" makes a powerful case for its subject. This is a biography in the old-fashioned mode. Curzon's private life only rarely intrudes, Gilmour never delves into forensic psychology, and there is no attempt to spare the reader the intricacies of British party politics. In other words, this is a biography for adults. Curzon, who preferred facts to sentiment, would have been pleased."--Amanda Foreman, "The New York Times Book Review" "Until now no single work adequately chronicled Curzon's entire life. Gilmour's absorbing, intelligent, quizzical, and stylish biography covers with equal authority and panache late-Victorian country-house weekends, maneuverings within the War Cabinet, and the background of the Treaty of Lausanne . . . No clearer and more vivid account has been written of the high point of the Raj."--"The Atlantic Monthly" "[An] elegant biography . . . A fast-moving, entertaining, and finely written story."--Simon Schama, "The New Yorker" "A magnificent work . . . entirely convincing in its evocation of Curzon's extraordinary character. It is, in short, the definitive life."--David Cannadine, "The Observer""""Gilmour has given this extraordinary man the treatment he deserves . . . A narrative that is trustworthy and enthralling."--Nigel Nicolson, "The Spectator""""[A] scrupulously researched, well-written account of Curzon's life and career."--Merle Rubin, "The Washington Times" "Masterly . . . As timely as it is scholarly, well-researched and comprehensive . . . It is extremely unlikely that a better portrait of either a British viceroy or the climax of the Raj will be written in the foreseeable future."--William Dalrymple, "Los Angeles"" Times Book Review" "Gilmour explains superbly how Curzon worked through the local peoples themselves to create a fully functioning, successful state in Asia . . . Americans who wish to elevate their country from a republic to an empire should read this book, which superbly illuminates the opportunities, the glories and the pitfalls of such an endeavor."--Andrew Roberts, "The Wall Street Journal" "A superb new biography . . . A tragic story, brilliantly told."--Andrew Roberts, "Literary Review""""An absorbing, witty, and intelligent biography . . . Gilmour's mix of erudition, hard analysis and quizzical amusement will give this volume a unique place on the ever more crowded shelves of political biography."--Ben Pimlott, "The Independent on Sunday""""A biography as definitive as such a work can ever be . . . A splendid book."--Lord Blake, "Evening Standard""""Gilmour has brought to this study qualities which few biographers attain . . . Curzon's story, sometimes portrayed as a study in failure, is here restored to the high ground . . . Gilmour has given the whole life its due."--Martin Gilbert, "The Guardian" "Well researched, soundly constructed, sometimes witty, sometimes eloquent, always admirably fair. Curzon needed and deserved a significant new biography; Gilmour has done him proud."--Philip Ziegler, "The Daily Telegraph" "One of the best biographies of our time . . . A book of outstanding excellence."--Piers Brendon, "New Statesman" "A magisterial and, one hopes, definitive biography . . . [A] massive study . . . Curzon, who had a keen sense of history, has been well served."--Gerard Alexander, "The Virginia Quarterly Review" "Gilmour charts Curzon's life through success and failure, turning in a well-formed view of the late imperial era in the bargain. An outstanding biography of an important historical figure."--"Kirkus Reviews""""In our enlightened age, to label someone as an imperialist 'empire man' is usually a pejorative designation. So it is useful to be reminded that many of the men who administered the British Empire were men of immense intellect, creativity, and curiosity. In Gilmour's previous biography of the supposed arch-imperialist Kipling ("The Long Recessional," 2002), he revealed the complexities of his subject while n0 displaying a wonderful grasp of the spirit of the Victorian age. Here he chronicles the life of one of the true giants of the latter stages of the empire. Curzon was born into a family of relatively impoverished aristocrats. He saw public service as both a duty and a means to personal advancement. As viceroy of India, he instituted vital and progressive reforms in taxation and showed a devotion to preserving India's historical monuments. Yet he remained a staunch devotee of British stewardship of the subcontinent, and his attitudes toward Indians can, charitably, be described as patronizing. Although he later served admirably as foreign secretary, his arrogance and knack for offending people probably prevented his selection as prime minister. Despite his undeniable accomplishments, Curzon died a lonely, embittered man. This is a superbly written account of a proud, talented, but rather tragic figure."--Jay Freeman, "Booklistt" (starred review)	2006-02-07	Macmillan						ZZZ000000
9780865479524	Turn the Beat Around,The Secret History of Disco	Peter Shapiro		A long-overdue paean to the predominant musical form of the 70s and a thoughtful exploration of the culture that spawned it Disco may be the most universally derided musical form to come about in the past forty years. Yet, like its pop cultural peers punk and hip hop, it was born of a period of profound social and economic upheaval. In Turn the Beat Around, critic and journalist Peter Shapiro traces the history of disco music and culture. From the outset, disco was essentially a shotgun marriage between a newly out and proud gay sexuality and the first generation of post-civil rights African Americans, all to the serenade of the recently developed synthesizer. Shapiro maps out these converging influences, as well as disco's cultural antecedents in Europe, looks at the history of DJing, explores the mainstream disco craze at it's apex, and details the long shadow cast by disco's performers and devotees on today's musical landscape. One part cultural study, one part urban history, and one part glitter-pop confection, Turn the Beat Around is the most comprehensive study of the Me Generation to date.	2006	Macmillan						ZZZ000000
9780374272104	Superclass,the global power elite and the world they are making	David Jochanan Rothkopf		Each of them is one in a million. They number six thousand on a planet of six billion. They run our governments, our largest corporations, the powerhouses of international finance, the media, world religions, and, from the shadows, the world's most dangerous criminal and terrorist organizations. They are the global superclass, and they are shaping the history of our time. Today's superclass has achieved unprecedented levels of wealth and power. They have globalized more rapidly than any other group. But do they have more in common with one another than with their own countrymen, as nationalist critics have argued? They control globalization more than anyone else. But has their influence fed the growing economic and social inequity that divides the world? What happens behind closeddoor meetings in Davos or aboard corporate jets at 41,000 feet? Conspiracy or collaboration? Deal-making or idle self-indulgence? What does the rise of Asia and Latin America mean for the conventional wisdom that shapes our destinies? Who sets the rules for a group that operates beyond national laws? Drawn from scores of exclusive interviews and extensive original reporting, "Superclass "answers all of these questions and more. It draws back the curtain on a privileged society that most of us know little about, even though it profoundly affects our everyday lives. It is the first in-depth examination of the connections between the global communities of leaders who are at the helm of every major enterprise on the planet and control its greatest wealth. And it is an unprecedented examination of the trends within the superclass, which are likely to alter our politics, our institutions, and the shape of the world in which we live. David Rothkopf is the author of "Running the World: The Inside Story of the National Security Council and the Architects of American Power. "He is the president and chief executive of Garten Rothkopf, an international advisory firm; a visiting scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace; and a teacher of international affairs at Columbia University's Graduate School of International and Public Affairs. David Rothkopf estimates that there are six thousand members of the superclass--on a planet of six billion. They are the wealthiest, the most elite, and they hold the most power. They run our governments, our largest corporations, the powerhouses of international finance, the media, world religions, and, from the shadows, the world's most dangerous criminal and terrorist organizations. The six thousand people who compose the global superclass are shaping the history of our time. Today's superclass has achieved unprecedented levels of wealth and power. Nationalist critics have argued that they have more in common with one another than with their own countrymen. They have globalized more rapidly than any other group--they control globalization--but they have been accused of feeding the growing economic and social inequity that divides the world.

And it is an unprecedented examination of the trends within the superclass, which are likely to alter our politics, our institutions, and the shape of the world in which we live. "Mr. Rothkopf's book argues that on many of the most critical issues of our time, the influence of all nation-states is waning, the system for addressing global issues among nation-states is more ineffective than ever, and therefore a power void is being created. This void is often being filled by a small group of players--'the superclass'--a new global elite, who are much better suited to operating on the global stage and influencing global outcomes than the vast majority of national political leaders." --Thomas L. Friedman, "The New York Times" "Mr. Rothkopf's book argues that on many of the most critical issues of our time, the influence of all nation-states is waning, the system for addressing global issues among nation-states is more ineffective than ever, and therefore a power void is being created. This void is often being filled by a small group of players--'the superclass'--a new global elite, who are much better suited to operating on the global stage and influencing global outcomes than the vast majority of national political leaders." --Thomas L. Friedman, "The New York Times ""Mr Rothkopf makes a fascinating tour of the world of the superclass. He opens the door to the office of the head of Goldman Sachs, Lloyd Blankfein, on the top floor of Goldman's tower on New York's Broad Street. He visits the factory that customises Gulfstream jets (every year nearly 10% of Gulfstream's clients attend Davos). He calls on the Carlyle Group where financiers and former presidents get together to make each other richer. And he offers a tour of the weird proceedings of the Bohemian Grove meetings, which Richard Nixon described as 'the most faggy goddamned thing you could ever imagine' . . . "Superclass "is a pioneering study of a subject that has often been the preserve of conspiracy theorists. Mr Rothkopf is anything but a crank, and he is right when he says that, these days, the most influential people around the world are also the most global people. He is also admirably ambivalent about his subject. He worries about surging inequality--the richest 1% of humans own 40% of the planet's wealth--and about the rumbling backlash against so much unaccountable power. But he points out that, in a world where most global institutions are lumbering and antiquated, members of the superclass have repeatedly stepped in to put the global system to rights. Let us hope that they have not lost their touch."--"The Economist ""If you're trying to figure out where to throw your Molotov cocktails, David Rothkopf's book proves you've got your work cut out for you. The businessman and former Clinton official spent years crunching numbers and trailing the 6,000 or so 'power elite' who make most of the decisions about how the planet works. Neither a gossipfest nor an anarchist call to arms, this measured book demonstrates the way these elite businessmen anonymously influence politicians and dictators, and take advantage of international chaos to advance their own interests."--"New York" magazine "There are just over 6,000 people in the superclass. So says the author of this fascinating book, a field guide to the world's most elite citizens. See the rich and powerful in their natural habitats, from Davos and Bilderberg to the Bohemian Grove.

Honor and decency are nothing in a city where respect is measured by the size of your expense account. And it's the city that Brad Rowan, a man on the make, hopes to conquer on his climb to the top, bringing with him the women he loves, uses, and destroys. Drawing from his own experiences in New York, Robbins vividly portrays our eternal desire for greed, desire, and blind ambition, in this timeless tale of success and struggle in the city that never sleeps.	2006-03-15	Macmillan						ZZZ000000

It was "the perfect storm"-a tempest that may happen only once in a century-a nor'easter created by so rare a combination of factors that it could not possibly have been worse. Creating waves ten stories high and winds of 120 miles an hour, the storm whipped the sea to inconceivable levels few people on earth have ever witnessed. Few, except the six-man crew of the Andrea Gail, a commercial fishing boat tragically headed toward the storm's hellish center.	2006	Fourth Estate						ZZZ000000
9780743268097	The End of Faith,Religion, Terror, and the Future of Reason	Sam Harris		This important and timely book delivers a startling analysis of the clash of faith and reason in today's world. Sam Harris offers a vivid historical tour of mankind's willingness to suspend reason in favour of religious beliefs, even when those beliefs are used to justify harmful behaviour and sometimes heinous crimes. He asserts that in the shadow of weapons of mass destruction, we can no longer tolerate views that pit one true god against another. Most controversially, he argues that we cannot afford moderate lip service to religion -- an accommodation that only blinds us to the real perils of fundamentalism. While warning against the encroachment of organised religion into world politics, Harris also draws on new evidence from neuroscience and insights from philosophy to explore spirituality as a biological, brain-based need. He calls on us to invoke that need in taking a secular humanistic approach to solving the problems of this world.	2006	Free Press						ZZZ000000

Blueprint Affordable will dispel those fears and put builders on the path to a home that is personal, beautiful, and affordable. Discover the secrets of cost-conscious design and construction through the examples of ten cutting-edge residential designs, and see how building a unique home doesn't have to be prohibitively expensive. Author Michelle Kodis includes an amazing list of helpful information, guidelines, and tips to follow throughout the planning and building process such as: keep a simple floor plan opt for off-the-shelf stock sizes, which cost less than their customized counterparts choose locally available materials study your building site's climate and weather patterns, and focus on an architectural plan that shields the home from the elements omit a basement where possible-you'll save thousands on excavation costs do your own research and purchase your own lighting fixtures, paint, carpet, and appliances instead of hiring an outside consultant to do soBudget-mindedness and beauty don't live on opposite sides of the architectural block, as the ten houses in Blueprint Affordable strikingly demonstrate. As exceptional as they are in their design, these houses all share one key attribute: from the very beginning, before their owners' dreams were transformed into exciting realities, everything from the floor plan to building materials and finishes was driven by limited financial resources.Since receiving her master of science degree from the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism in 1991, Michelle Kodis has written about a broad range of topics, including architecture and design, the environment, health, business, and cuisine. She lives with her husband near Telluride, Colorado, and is currently at work on additional architecture/design books for Gibbs Smith, Publisher.

9781586857974	The architecture of entertainment,L.A. in the twenties	Robert Winter&Alexander Vertikoff		"As the most pervasive influence life has yet known motion pictures have had a definite influence on trends taken by architecture within the last decade."  Cecil B. DeMille writing for the Bulletin of the Allied Architects of L.A. in 1925 The 1920s were a time of dramatic change and burgeoning growth in the City of Angels. Much of the varied architectural milieu of Los Angeles came to be during this decade, as the center of the city was planned and talented architects from around the world flooded into the area and competed for projects. Images of flappers, booze, and jazz combined with the escapist attitude that came to dominate the decade and led to much of the early-twentieth-century "escape" architecture of Los Angeles.  In L.A. in the '20s, noted architectural historian and author Robert Winter explains this "architecture of entertainment"-the inherent beauty and mystery of the era when historic architectural styles became adventurous escapades. Chapters cover topics such as "Planning the City Beautiful," "Eclecticism," "Housing for the Masses," "Gardens," "Public Architecture," and more. Architects covered in this book include Bertram Goodhue; Morgan, Walls and Clements; Allison and Allison; and Parkinson and Parkinson working in public architecture; as well as Frank Lloyd Wright and Wallace Neff working in residential architecture. Also included here are works from noted modernists Irving Gill, Alfred Loos, Richard Neutra, and others.  Some of the buildings featured in this book include:  Fine Arts Building (1925) the Pantages Theater (1920) Huntington's gardens Milestone Mo-tel (1924-25) St. Vincent de Paul Roman Catholic Church (1923-25) Hall of Justice Building (1925)  City Hall (1926-28)	2006	Gibbs Smith						ZZZ000000

9781862078826	Our Inner Ape,The Best and Worst of Human Nature	Frans De Waal		We have long attributed man's violent, aggressive, competitive nature to his animal ancestry. But what if we are just as given to cooperation, empathy, and morality by virtue of our genes? From a scientist and writer whom E.O. Wilson has called `the world authority on primate social behavior' comes a lively look at the most provocative aspects of human nature-power, sex, violence, kindness, and morality-through our two closest cousins in the ape family. For nearly 20 years, Frans de Waal has worked with both the famously aggressive chimpanzee and the lesser-known egalitarian, erotic, matriarchal bonobo, two species whose DNA is nearly identical to that of humans. He brings these apes to life on every page, revealing their personalities, relationships, and power struggles, creating an engrossing narrative that explores what their behaviour can teach us about ourselves and each other.	2006-09-04	Granta Books						ZZZ000000
9781862078765	1491,The Americas Before Columbus	Charles C. Mann		Up until very recently it was believed that in 1491, the year before Columbus landed, the Americas, one-third of the earth's surface, were a near-pristine wilderness inhabited by small, roaming bands of indigenous peoples. Then, the story went, they encountered European society, their world was turned upside down and they entered history. But recently unexpected discoveries have dramatically changed our understanding of Indian Life. Many scholars now argue that the Indians were much more numerous than previously believed, that they were in the Americas for far longer, and that they had far more ecological impact on the land. This knowledge has enormous implications for today's environmental disputes, yet little has filtered into textbooks, and even less into public awareness. Charles Mann brings together all of the latest research, and the results of his own travels throughout North and South America, to provide a new, fascinating and iconoclastic account of the Americas before Columbus.	2006	Granta Books						ZZZ000000

9781862078352	What do Buddhists believe?	Tony Morris		`I believe that every human being has an innate desire for happiness and does not want to suffer. I also believe that the very purpose of life is to experience this happiness.' The Dalai Lama Buddhism is one of the world's oldest and most widespread belief-systems. Its history spans two and a half thousand years and Buddhism today has over 500 million adherents throughout almost every country in the world. Virtually unknown outside Asia until the last century, it is now the fastest growing religion in the West. What is it about Buddhism that attracts so many in an age when people seem to be turning away from organised religion? The teachings of Buddhism are voluminous and varied, and it has a well developed philosophical and mystical dimension; but at its core is a simple set of propositions and practices designed to meet the practical day to day concerns of ordinary people: how to live a compassionate, creative, wise and, above all, happy life. Tony Morris explores Buddhism's appeal and gives an acute insight into its essential beliefs.	2006-04-03	Granta						ZZZ000000

9781862078338	What do Christians believe?	Malcolm Guite		'I give you a new commandment, that you love one another. Just as I have loved you, you also should love one another.' Jesus Christ Christianity began as a minor sect within Judaism and has become one of the major world religions. What started as a small group of people who shared the same language, lifestyle and background, is now a movement which embraces many different languages and cultures, giving rise to an astonishing variety of practices and interpretations - yet all with a common basis of shared faith inspired by the teaching, life, death, and new life of a carpenter from Nazareth. How has this happened? In this book, written for the reader looking for quick practical insights into the beliefs and practices of Christianity, Malcolm Guite offers a lucid summary and interpretation of the Christian faith. Jesus himself identified love as the essential element in both worship and daily life. Using this teaching, and the core Christian belief that Jesus was God's way of opening himself to humanity, Guite explains the inner meaning of such key Christian teachings as atonement, redemption and the concept of God as Trinity.	2006-03-04	Granta Books						ZZZ000000

Combining mathematical riddles with technological pyrotechnics and vivid suspense, Martin Gardner has created a new fable celebrating the power of the imagination and the lure of an ageless heroine named Dorothy from the turn of the century.	2000-02	St. Martin's Press						ZZZ000000

9780312328672	Defending Israel,A Controversial Plan Toward Peace	Martin Van Creveld		Israel is a tiny country. From tip to toe, it stretches 260 miles long but is only 60 miles at its widest point. Since the days of the British mandate, the question of "defensible borders" for the Jewish state has always been problematic. Yet considering the larger picture of what has happened in the Middle East over the last 25 years -- the peace treaties with Egypt and Jordan, the weakening of Syria as a result of the collapse of the USSR, the smashing of Iraq by the U.S -- Israel is, militarily speaking, stronger than ever before. The greatest remaining threats are terrorism and guerilla warfare; and those, this book argues, are best dealt with territorial concessions. This is a compact, incisive study that is certain to draw attention.	2005-08-16	Macmillan						ZZZ000000

9780802118301	Winkie	Clifford Chase		In Cliff Chase's scathingly funny and surprisingly humane debut novel, the zeitgeist assumes the form of a one-foot-tall ursine Everyman--a mild-mannered teddy bear named Winkie who comes to life and finds himself on the wrong side of America's war on terror. After suffering decades of neglect from the children who once loved him, Winkie realizes that taking charge of his fate is as simple as knowing that he can do it, and so he hurls himself off the shelf, jumps out the window, and takes to the forest. But just as he is discovering the joys and wonders of mobility, self-determination, even true love, this small brown creature of indeterminate gender gets trapped in the jaws of a society gone rabid with fear and paranoia. Having come upon the cabin of the mad professor who stole his beloved, Winkie is suddenly surrounded by the FBI, who instantly conclude that he is the evil mastermind behind dozens of terrorist attacks that have been traced to the forest. Terrified and confused, Winkie is brought to trial, where the prosecution attempts to seal the little bear's fate by calling upon witnesses from the trials of Galileo, Socrates, John Scopes, and Oscar Wilde. Emotionally gripping and intellectually compelling, Winkie introduces the most memorable protagonist since the Velveteen Rabbit, and--with the help of a lesbian Moslem cleaning woman, a stuttering attorney, and a Lacan-spewing bear cub--brilliantly exposes the cruel absurdities of our age and explores what it means to be human in an increasingly barbaric world.	2006-06-28	Open City Books						ZZZ000000
9780871139269	Nell Gwyn,mistress to a king	Charles Beauclerk		Written by a direct descendant of the union between Nell Gwyn and King Charles II, "Nell Gwyn" tells the story of one of England's great folk heroines. Born during a tumultuous period in England's past, Nell Gwyn was spotted selling oranges in the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane. Nell's wit and charm brought her to the attention of numerous suitors, including one of the theater's leading actors, Charles Hart. Under his patronage Nell took to the stage where she became one of London's first professional female actresses, and the finest comedienne in London. She then caught the eye of the pleasure-seeking "merry monarch" King Charles II, and their seventeen-year love affair played out against the backdrop of the Great Fire of London, the Great Plague, court scandals, and the constant threat of political revolution. Magnificently re-creating the heady, licentious, yet politically charged atmosphere of Restoration England, "Nell Gwyn" tells the true-life Cinderella story of a common orange girl who became England's first "people's princess."	2005-10-10	Atlantic Monthly Press						ZZZ000000

9780316027823	Globalisation, democracy and terrorism	Eric J. Hobsbawm		In this collection of illuminating, incisive and thought-provoking essays, Eric Hobsbawm examines every aspect of the issues that have inspired the greatest debate - not only among politicians, academics and commentators but among all of us - in recent years: that is, the effects of globalisation, the plight of democracy and the threat of terrorism. As we are only too aware, all of these have the power to affect our daily lives, from the state of our economies to the fear of murderous bomb attacks in our cities. Hobsbawm discusses war and peace in our lifetime, problems of public order, anarchy and terrorism, nationalism and the changing nature of the nation-state, and the future prospects for democracy, setting out the historical background and the lessons it can offer us. Above all, he turns his piercing gaze to the Middle East and Western imperialism. Engaging, erudite and demonstrating his characteristically firm grasp of the facts and statistics, Hobsbawm's essays are indispensable to our understanding of the world we live in.	2007	Little, Brown						ZZZ000000

9780307394200	The conviction of Richard Nixon,the untold story of the Frost/Nixon interviews	James Reston		The Watergate scandal began with a break-in at the office of the Democratic National Committee at the Watergate Hotel on June 17, 1971, and ended when President Gerald Ford granted Richard M. Nixon a pardon on September 8, 1974, one month after Nixon resigned from office in disgrace. Effectively removed from the reach of prosecutors, Nixon returned to California, uncontrite and unconvicted, convinced that time would exonerate him of any wrongdoing and certain that history would remember his great accomplishmentsthe opening of China and the winding down of the Vietnam Warand forget his "mistake," the "pipsqueak thing" called Watergate. In 1977, three years after his resignation, Nixon agreed to a series of interviews with television personality David Frost. Conducted over twelve days, they resulted in twenty-eight hours of taped material, which were aired on prime-time television and watched by more than 50 million people worldwide. Nixon, a skilled lawyer by training, was paid $1 million for the interviews, confident that this exposure would launch him back into public life. Instead, they sealed his fate as a political pariah. James Reston, Jr., was David Frost's Watergate advisor for the interiews, and The Conviction of Richard Nixon is his intimate, behind-the-scenes account of his involvement. Originally written in 1977 and published now for the first time, this book helped inspire Peter Morgan's hit play Frost/Nixon. Reston doggedly researched the voluminous Watergate record and worked closely with Frost to develop the interrogation strategy. Even at the time, Reston recognized the historical importance of the Frost/Nixon interviews; they would result either in Nixon's de facto conviction and vindication for the American people, or in his exoneration and public rehabilitation in the hands of a lightweight. Focused, driven, and committed to exposing the truth, Reston worked tirelessly to arm Frost with the information he needed to force Nixon to admit his culpability. InThe Conviction of Richard Nixon, Reston provides a fascinating, fly-on-the-wall account of his involvement in the Nixon interviews as David Frost's Watergate adviser. Written in 1977 immediately following these celebrated television interviews and published now for the first time,The Conviction of Richard Nixonexplains how a British journalist of waning consequence drove the famously wily and formidable Richard Nixon to say, in an apparent personal epiphany, "I have impeached myself."	2007-06-19	Random House, Inc.

9780060523657	Fortune favors the bold,what we must do to build a new and lasting global prosperity	Lester C. Thurow		The new global economy is linking the fortunes of every nation on every continent -- for good or for ill. Its hallmark is a rising instability and a growing inequality between the first and third worlds, in spite of rising average incomes. The United States and other first world economies are finding it hard to recover after the boom of the 1990s and the bust of the early 21st century. Financial crises in the third world come frequently and are increasingly severe. Globalization is invoked to explain riots, civil disobedience, and as a factor in the rise of terrorism. Lester Thurow argues now is the time to shape globalization into what we want it to be -- before it's too late. Today, he explains, we are at a critical crossroads in the development of the global economy. We can sit back and let it grow as it will, or we can seize the moment and build economic systems that will minimize instability, allow second and third world countries to thrive, and protect and enhance our own American interests. In short, a win/win global economy that benefits all participants. Globalization, says Thurow, can be shaped. In Fortune Favors the Bold, Thurow provides an insightful analysis of the ills of globalization and, more important, offers solutions. He tackles subjects such as:  The dangers of the burgeoning U.S. trade deficit and the falling dollar Solving the problem of intellectual property rights violations Restarting Japan's stagnating economy How best to help underdeveloped countries enter the global economy Reforming the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund  Further, Thurow shows how the economic successes of Ireland and China provide a model for other countries to follow. He even proposes creating anew role for a "Chief Knowledge Officer" to help guide companies and governments in the developing global knowledge-based economy of the 21st century. Globalization will continue whether we like it our not. We are at a critical moment; great challenges lay ahead, and our economic future is at stake. Now, with Fortune Favors the Bold, we have a map and guidebook to a prosperous economic future.	2003	HarperCollins						ZZZ000000

After rising through ABC television and Paramount Pictures, he awoke the sleeping giant of Disney and sent it stomping across the entertainment landscape. But since the tragic death of Frank Wells in a helicopter crash in 1994, he has lacked -- for the first time in his career -- a colleague who could temper his personality.The result, writes Kim Masters, has been a slide into a Nixonian paranoia and isolation. In The Keys to the Kingdom, Masters crafts a gripping account of this larger-than-life story of larger-than-life hubris, combining an insightful analysis of power in Hollywood with a vivid, deeply researched narrative that brings the personalities, the enmities, and the corporate mayhem to life.	2001-07-31	HarperBusiness						ZZZ000000
9780060014063	The Watson Dynasty,The Fiery Reign and Troubled Legacy of IBM's Founding Father and Son	Richard S. Tedlow		For an extraordinary fifty-seven-year period, the chief executives of the International Business Machines Corporation were Thomas J. Watson and Thomas J. Watson, father and son. IBM bears the imprint of both men -- their ambitions and their strengths -- but it also bears the consequences of a family that was in near-constant conflict. Eminent historian Richard S. Tedlow explores the interplay between the personalities of these two extraordinary men and the firm they created. Both Watsons had deeply held beliefs about what a corporation is and should be. These ideas helped make "Big Blue" the bluest of blue-chip stocks during their tenure. These very ideals, however, also sowed the seeds for IBM's disasters in the late 1980s and early 1990s, when the company had lost sight of the original meaning behind many of the practices each man put into place.	2004-11-11	HarperCollins						ZZZ000000

9780007153589	How to be alone	Jonathan Franzen		Passionate, independent-minded nonfiction from the international bestselling author of 'The Corrections'.Jonathan Franzen's 'The Corrections' was the best-loved and most written-about novel of 2001. Nearly every in-depth review of it discussed what became known as 'The Harper's Essay,' Franzen's controversial 1996 look at the fate of the novel. This essay is reprinted for the first time in 'How to be Alone', alongside the personal essays and painstaking, often funny reportage that earned Franzen a wide readership before the success of 'The Corrections'. Although his subjects range from the sex-advice industry to the way a supermax prison works, each piece wrestles with familiar themes of Franzen's writing: the erosion of civic life and private dignity, and the hidden persistence of loneliness, in postmodern, imperial America. Recent pieces include a moving essay on his father's struggle with Alzheimer's disease and a rueful account of Franzen's brief tenure as an Oprah Winfrey author.As a collection, these essays record what Franzen calls 'a movement away from an angry and frightened isolation toward an acceptance - even a celebration - of being a reader and a writer.' At the same time they show the wry distrust of the claims of technology and psychology, the love-hate relationship with consumerism, and the subversive belief in the tragic shape of the individual life that help make Franzen one of the sharpest, toughest-minded, and most entertaining social critics at work today.	2004	Harper Perennial						ZZZ000000

So long as he is, above all, afraid.Jimmy Tock comes into the world on the very night his grandfather leaves it. As a violent storm rages outside the hospital, Rudy Tock spends long hours walking the corridors between the expectant fathers' waiting room and his dying father's bedside. It's a strange vigil made all the stranger when, at the very height of the storm's fury, Josef Tock suddenly sits up in bed and speaks coherently for the first and last time since his stroke.What he says before he dies is that there will be five dark days in the life of his grandson - five dates whose terrible events Jimmy will have to prepare himself to face. The first is to occur in his 20th year; the second in his 23rd year; the third in his 28th; the fourth in his 29th; the fifth in his 30th.Rudy is all too ready to discount his father's last words as a dying man's delusional rambling. But then he discovers that Josef also predicted the moment of his grandson's birth to the minute, as well as his exact height, weight, and the fact that Jimmy would be born with syndactyly - the unexplained anomaly of fused digits on his left foot. Suddenly, the old man's predictions take on a chilling significance.What terrifying events await Jimmy on these five dark days? What nightmares will he face? What challenges must he survive? As the novel unfolds, picking up Jimmy's story at each of these crisis points, the path he must follow will defy every expectation. And with each crisis he faces, he will move closer to a fate he could never have imagined. For who Jimmy Tock is and what he must accomplish on the five days his world turns is a mystery as dangerous as it is wondrous - a struggle against an evil so dark and pervasive only the most extraordinary of human spirits can shine through.	2005-08-01	HarperCollins Publishers						ZZZ000000
9780006386933	Juan Carlos,steering Spain from dictatorship to democracy	Paul Preston		A powerful biography of Spain's great king, Juan Carlos, by the pre-eminent writer on 20th century Spanish history.There are two central mysteries in the life of Juan Carlos, one personal, the other political. How to explain the apparent serenity with which he accepted that his father had surrendered him, to all intents and purposes, into the safekeeping of the Franco regime? In any normal family, this would have been considered a kind of cruelty or, at the very least, baleful negligence. But a royal family can never be normal, and the decision to send the young Juan Carlos away from Spain was governed by a certain 'superior' dynastic logic.The second mystery lies in how a prince raised in a family with the strictest authoritarian traditions, who was obliged to conform to the Francoist norms during his youth and educated to be a cornerstone of the plans for the reinforcement of the dictatorship, eventually sided so emphatically and courageously with democratic principles.Paul Preston - perhaps the greatest living commentator on modern Spain - has set out to address these mysteries, and in so doing has written the definitive biography of King Juan Carlos. He tackles the king's turbulent relationship with his father, his cloistered education, his bravery in defending Spain's infant democracy after Franco's death and his immense hard work in consolidating parliamentary democracy in Spain. The resulting biography is both rigorous and riveting, its vibrant prose doing justice to its vibrant subject. It is a book fit for a king.	2005	Harper Perennial						ZZZ000000

9780007215041	Tarantula	Bob Dylan		Written in 1966, Tarantula is a collection of poems and prose that evokes the turbulence of the times in which it was written, and gives a unique insight into Dylan's creative evolution - it was written during work on his magnum opus, Blonde on Blonde.'the good samaritan coming in with the words "round & round we go" tattoed on his cheek / he tells the senator to stop insulting the lawyer'Written in 1966, Tarantula captures Bob Dylan's preoccupations at a crucial juncture in his artistic development, showcasing the antic imagination of a folk poet laureate who was able to combine the humanity and compassion of his country roots with the playful surrealism of modern art. Angry, funny and strange, the poems and prose in this collection reflect the concerns we find in Dylan's most seminal music: a sense of protest, a verbal playfulness and spontaneity, and a belief in the artistic legitimacy of chronicling everyday life and eccentricity on the street.Tarantula never made its publication date in Autumn 1966. To the delays added by Dylan's constant revisions was added the greater complication of his motorcyle accident - which left him with still undisclosed injuries and kept the book from publication until 1971. In the interim, it became a cult phenomenon, with 'bookleg' editions photocopied from reviewer proofs circulating throughout the musical and literary demi-mondes. Reissued to coincide with the paperback release of Chronicles 1, Tarantula will finally find the wider audience it deserves.	2005-10-03	Harper Perennial						FIC000000

In this portrait of a troubled genius falling to earth, we feel Coleridge's hopeless heartache, his disappointments, his addiction to opium, his elated highs and catastrophic lows, and experience his visits to the darkest depths of the abyss. But we also witness an act of extraordinary biographical reclamation, as Richard Holmes convinces us of the astonishing breadth of the vision and poetic power which remained with Coleridge to the end."--BOOK JACKET.	2005	Harper Perennial						ZZZ000000

9780007198856	Warriors	Max Hastings		An exhilarating and uplifting account of the lives of sixteen 'warriors' from the last three centuries, hand-picked for their bravery or extraordinary military experience by the eminent military historian, author and ex-editor of the Daily Telegraph, Sir Max Hastings.Over the course of forty years writing about war, Max Hastings has grown fascinated by outstanding deeds of derring-do on the battlefield (land, sea or air) - and by their practitioners. He takes as his examples sixteen people from different nationalities in modern history - including Napoleon's 'blessed fool' Baron Marcellin de Marbot (the model for Conan Doyle's Brigadier Gerard); Sir Harry Smith, whose Spanish wife Juana became his military companion on many a campaign in the early 19th century; Lieutenant John Chard, an unassuming engineer who became the hero of Rorke's Drift in the Zulu wars; and Squadron Leader Guy Gibson, the 'dam buster' whose heroism in the skies of World War II earned him the nation's admiration but few friends.Every army, in order to prevail on the battlefield, needs a certain number of people capable of courage beyond the norm. In this book Max Hastings investigates what this norm might be - and how it has changed over the centuries. While celebrating feats of outstanding valour, he also throws a beady eye over the awarding of medals for gallantry - and why it is that so often the most successful warriors rarely make the grade as leaders of men.	2006-03-06	Harper Perennial						ZZZ000000

9780007214655	Atlas of World War II	John Keegan		A stunning visual history of the greatest conflict in world history. The Second World War is the single largest event in the history of mankind: no populated continent was untouched by its operations and the political structure of the post-war world has been largely determined by its outcome. The global nature of the war, and the ambitions of the belligerents, meant that it was fought on a scale which, even today, confounds the imagination. It was a stimulus to unparalleled economic activity and provoked the most important clash of ideologies experienced by the world since the Crusades. The scale and scope of the war is presented here in graphic form. Maps form the basis for tracing not only the military campaigns, but also the social, economic, and political developments during the war. Examination of decisive battles, military tactics, new weaponry, and key commanders adds a further depth of understanding of the war that forever changed our world.	2006	Collins						ZZZ000000

The wizard Gwydion knows that the only hope for the future lies with Willand, the young man he believes to be the reincarnation of King Arthur. But Will is beset with doubts. He is being stalked by the Dark Child, the twin from whom he was separated at birth and who now serves Maskull. And as the magic gradually begins to fade from the world, the powers of Gwydion, his mentor and friend, seem to be fading too, leading Will to despair that the destruction of the war will ever be halted, or Maskull ever defeated. Despite the seeming impossibility of his task, Will is not ready to give up quite yet. With the help of his strong-minded wife, Willow, and friends as wise and generous as the loremasters Morann and Gort, Will journeys the Realm seeking his destiny. And soon it becomes clear that only by solving the riddle of his own identity can he save the world he loves so deeply.	2006-01-01	HarperCollins						ZZZ000000

9780060540326	Road to Paradise	Max Allan Collins		Collins chronicled the gripping story of one young boy's travels with his gangster father in the New York Times bestseller Road to Perdition, then led his readers along the unforgettable Road to Purgatory-a tale of this same boy, all grown up. Now, in his most powerful work to date, we again meet Michael Satariano and travel with him as he faces the most difficult and heartbreaking struggle of his life. Lake Tahoe, 1973: Michael Satariano-who as a young man fought the Capone mob in Chicago-has reached a comfortable middle age, with a loving wife at home, a talented teenage daughter in high school, and a son earning medals in Vietnam. Now running a casino for the mob, Michael thinks he's put his killing days behind him-after all, he's made a respectable life for himself and his family . . . and plenty of money for the boys back in Chicago. So when godfather Sam Giancana orders him to hit a notoriously violent and vulnerable gangster, Michael refuses. But when the hit goes down anyway, Michael is framed for murder; to save his family, he must turn state's witness under the fledgling Witness Protection Program. Relocated to the supposed safety of Paradise, a tract-housing development in Arizona, Michael soon finds himself facing a wrath so cruel that even the boy raised by a hitman father is unprepared. And with his teenage daughter in tow, Michael must return to the road and a violent way of life he thought he had long left behind. In this stunning third installment of a trilogy so gripping and masterfully written that it could only come from "[among] the finest crime writers working today" (Milwaukee Journal Sentinel), we once again have a spellbinding window into a time of heroes and villains-and, above all, a journey along a road on which a man's greatest crimes are all a part of his lifelong struggle for redemption.	2006-11-28	HarperCollins						ZZZ000000

9780813305714	Theory of knowledge	Keith Lehrer		In this important new text, Keith Lehrer introduces students to the major traditional and contemporary accounts of knowing. Beginning with the traditional definition of knowledge as justified true belief, Lehrer explores the truth, belief, and justification conditions on the way to a thorough examination of foundation theories of knowledge, externalism and naturalized epistemologies, and internalism and modern coherence theories as well as recent reliabilist and causal theories. Lehrer gives all views careful examination and concludes that external factors must be matched by appropriate internal factors to yield knowledge. This match of internal and external factors follows from Lehrer's new coherence theory of undefeated justification.In addition to doing justice to the living epistemological traditions, the text smoothly integrates several new lines that will interest scholars. Lehrer argues, for example, that acceptance should replace the traditional belief condition and that knowledge can ultimately be understood as undefeated justification and truth as a consequence of a justification remaining undefeated.A feature of special interest is Lehrer's concept of a justification game. Lehrer explains justification in terms of a game between a claimant and a skeptic: The claimant wins and the knowledge claim is justified when he or she can beat or neutralize the moves of the skeptic.Readers of Professor Lehrer's earlier book, "Knowledge," will want to know that this text adopts the framework of that classic. But "Theory of Knowledge" is a thoroughly revised and up-dated version, containing several completely new chapters, that has been simplified throughout for student use.Written by awell-known scholar and contributor to modern epistemology, this text is distinguished by clarity of structure, accessible writing, and an elegant mix of traditional material, contemporary ideas, and well-motivated innovation. It will immediately take its place in the front rank of texts on the theory of knowledge.	1990	Westview Press						ZZZ000000
9780060929879	Brave new world	Aldous Huxley		A fantasy of the future that sheds a blazing critical light on the present--considered to be Aldous Huxley's most enduring masterpiece. "Mr. Huxley is eloquent in his declaration of an artist's faith in man, and it is his eloquence, bitter in attack, noble in defense, that, when one has closed the book, one remembers."--Saturday Review of Literature "A Fantastic racy narrative, full of much excellent satire and literary horseplay."--Forum  "It is as sparkling, provocative, as brilliant, in the appropriate sense, as impressive ads the day it was published. This is in part because its prophetic voice has remained surprisingly contemporary, both in its particular forecasts and in its general tone of semiserious alarm. But it is much more because the book succeeds as a work of art...This is surely Huxley's best book."--Martin Green	1998	HarperCollins						ZZZ000000

All powerful, all knowing, the proof of their genius is apparent in the mysterious monoliths at Stonehenge, and in a strange but highly significant sturcture of concentric stone circles in Israel's Golan Heights --both requiring sophisticated astronomical knowledge. Teaching man to look to the heavens, they bequeathed to us the Cosmic Code.The newest entry in a carefully researched multivolume series tracing the creation and motivation of mankind, this book identifies the turning point in our species' delicate balance between the demands of destiny and the vagaries of fate. From deep inside ancient Sumerian texts that predate even the Bible, Zecharia Sitchin dares to reveal the nature of prophecy and historical truths that have long been obscured by disbelief and misunderstanding: the code used to construct our kind by master builder from the stars.	1998-12	Avon Books						ZZZ000000

From the tale of a childless Chilean couple with an antiseptic life philosophy to an account of a desperate man who "disappears" himself in Texas, dreaming that someone actually wants to find him, Shorts opens our eyes to the reality of rich kids from poor countries swilling their cosmopolitans in New York, scared to death of their own homelands, and shows the influence of American pop culture on the hearts and minds of those who have never set foot in "Yankee Bohemia."   Unsettling and enlightening, Shorts conveys the American phenomenon of self-invention at its most extreme, as the culturally confounded rage against deflated fantasies in the face of obstinate realities.	2005-10-27	HarperCollins						ZZZ000000

9780060882419	747,creating the world's first jumbo jet and other adventures from a life in aviation	Joseph F. Sutter&Jay P. Spenser		747 is the thrilling story behind "the Queen of the Skies" -- the Boeing 747 -- as told by Joe Sutter, one of the most celebrated engineers of the twentieth century, who spearheaded its design and construction.   Born in 1921 in Seattle, Sutter grew up on a hilltop overlooking the Boeing plant and flying field. It was a thrilling era of open cockpits, silk scarves, leather helmets, and goggles. After serving in World War II, Sutter joined Boeing, then a small company, eager to build airplanes.   In July 1965, he was asked to lead the large Boeing team designing the new 747. Pan Am wanted a new airliner as quickly as possible. This all-new transport had to be far bigger than anything in service or even on anybody's drawing board. To make it fly, Sutter and his team would have to push far beyond the technological boundaries of the late 1960s. Could it be done?   Almost everything about the 747 would be unprecedented. Its cabin would be so wide that it would need two aisles. Its horizontal tail would be bigger than the wings of most airliners ever built. Jet engines big enough to lift it off the ground didn't yet exist. Runways at the world's airports couldn't handle it, and neither could Boeing's factories. They had to erect the world's largest building just to produce it. A truly mammoth undertaking, the 747 became one of the most successful airplane models ever.   Sutter's vivid narrative takes us back to a time when American technology was cutting-edge -- the 747 came on the market the same year that men first set foot on the moon -- and jet travel was still glamorous and new. With wit and warmth, he gives an insider's sense of the larger-than-life-size personalities -- and the tensions -- in the aeronautical world. Ultimately, 747 is an inspiring story of grit and glory.	2006-05-11	Smithsonian						ZZZ000000

9780060836276	Zamba,The True Story of the Greatest Lion That Ever Lived	Ralph Helfer		When Ralph Helfer, now one of Hollywood's top animal behaviorists, first began working, he was shocked by the cruelty that was accepted practice in the field. He firmly believed in "affection training" -- that love, not fear, should be the basis of any animal's development, even when dealing with the most dangerous of creatures. Then Zamba came into his life -- an adorable four-month-old lion cub that went on to prove Helfer's theories resoundingly correct. Over the next eighteen years, Zamba would thrive and grow, and go on to star in numerous motion pictures and television shows -- all the while developing a deep and powerful bond of love and affection with the man who raised him. By turns astonishing, hilarious, and poignant, "Zamba" is not only the unforgettable story of the relationship that Helfer would come to consider one of the most important in his life but also that of the amazing career and adventures of the greatest lion in the world.	2005-08	HarperCollins Publishers						ZZZ000000

9780060731472	Last Shot	Gregg Andrew Hurwitz		A seemingly impossible prison escape. A powerful and corrupt company. And a little boy's life hanging in the balance. Three startling plot threads come together as deputy U.S. marshal Tim Rackley faces the most deadly adversary of his career-a man whose lethal skills, cunning, and single-minded determination make him a mirror image of Rackley himself. Walker Jameson, dishonored Recon Marine, has pulled off an impossible break from California's Terminal Island Penitentiary. After starting a riot, he literally vanishes from his cell, leaving behind only a cup of mouthwash, a strand of dental floss tied to one cell bar, and the body of a sadistic killer. Tim Rackley, elite man hunter, must solve the riddle and track Walker down. But uncertainty begins to color the mission as Rackley learns more about his quarry and the death of the escaped prisoner's sister, a suicide that looks increasingly like a murder. Walker, too, has begun a bloody investigation of his own, a mission that propels him through the dark underworld of a big pharmaceutical company and its cutting-edge therapeutic viruses. But the life of Walker's nephew, a young boy suffering from a fatal disorder, hangs in the balance, and if Rackley hopes to stop the bloodshed, he must put the pieces together, even if it means battling a lethal opponent every inch his equal. A riveting thriller, a shocking look behind the scenes of one of America's most corrupt corporate sectors, and an exploration of the depths of a mother's love, Last Shot is a white-knuckled, complex drama, full of razor-sharp action and startling twists and turns, written by one of the finest suspense novelists working today.	2007-07-12	HarperCollins Publishers						ZZZ000000

As a boy growing up in Montana, he was Samson Hunts Alone -- until a deadly misunderstanding with the law forced him to flee the Crow reservation at age fifteen. Today he is Samuel Hunter, a successful Santa Barbara insurance salesman with a Mercedes, a condo, and a hollow, invented life. Then one day, shortly after his thirty-fifth birthday, destiny offers him the dangerous gift of love -- in the exquisite form of Calliope Kincaid -- and a curse in the unheralded appearance of an ancient Indian god by the name of Coyote.

Candid and compelling, AT THE CENTER OF THE STORM is George Tenet's memoir of his life at the CIA a revelatory look at the inner workings of America's top intelligence agency and its dealings with national leaders at home and abroad. Beginning with his installation as Director of Central Intelligence in 1997, Tenet unfolds the momentous events that led up to 9/11: his declaration of war on Al Qaeda in 1998, CIA operations inside Afghanistan, the worldwide operational plan to fight terror, his warnings to White House officials in the spring and summer of 2001, and the plan for a response laid down just six days after the attack. In his gripping narration of the runup to the war in Iraq, Tenet provides fresh insights and background, including a privileged account of how the famous "sixteen words" made it into the President's State of the Union speech, the real context of his own nowfamous "slamdunk" comment, and the CIA's views of the rise of an Iraqi insurgency. Finally, in addition to the backstage story of the headline events, Tenet will offer his thoughts on the future of U.S. intelligence and its role in foreignpolicy decisions, setting forth an informed plan for how we can forge a more secure world.	2007	HarperCollins						ZZZ000000
9780060198169	Prime green,remembering the sixties	Robert Stone		"A memoir of America's most turbulent, whimsical decade. From the New York City of Kline and De Kooning to the jazz era of New Orleans's French Quarter to Ken Kesey's psychedelic California, Prime Green explores the 1960s in all its weird, innocent, fascinating glory. An account framed by two wars, it begins with Stone's last year in the Navy and ends in Vietnam, where he was a correspondent in the days following the invasion of Laos. The narrative zips from coast to coast, from days spent in the raucous offices of Manhattan tabloids to the breathtaking beaches of Mexico, and merry times aboard the bus with Kesey and the Pranksters. These accounts of the sixties are riveting not only because Stone is a master storyteller but because he was there, in the thick of it, through all the wild times.--From publisher description."--From source other than the Library of Congress	2007-01-04	Ecco						ZZZ000000

When Robert Bly and Coleman Barks visited Iran, they heard schoolchildren singing Hafez poems at his graveside.

A master of the ghazal form, one of the greatest inventions in the history of poetry, Hafez may be considered as Rumi's wild younger brother, and is now translated into an English that helps us understand his true genius.	2008-03-17	Harper						ZZZ000000

9780060786656	Golda	Elinor Burkett		The first female head of state in the Western world and one of the most influential women in modern history, Golda Meir was a member of the tiny coterie of founders of the State of Israel, the architect of its socialist infrastructure, and its most tenacious international defender. Her uncompromising devotion to shaping and defending a Jewish homeland against dogged enemies and skittish allies stunned political contemporaries skeptical about the stamina of an elderly leader, and transformed Middle Eastern politics for decades to follow. A blend of Emma Goldman and Martin Luther King Jr. in the guise of a cookie-serving grandmother, Meir was a tough-as-nails politician who issued the first prescient warnings about the rise of international terrorism, out-maneuvered Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger at their own game of realpolitik, and led Israel through a bloody war even as she eloquently pleaded for peace. A prodigious fundraiser and persuasive international voice, Golda carried the nation through its most perilous hours while she herself battled cancer. In this masterful biography, critically acclaimed author and Pulitzer Prize-nominated journalist Elinor Burkett looks beyond Meir's well-known accomplishments to the complex motivations and ideals, personal victories and disappointments, of her charismatic public persona. Beginning with Meir's childhood in virulently anti-Semitic Russia and her family's subsequent relocation to the United States, Burkett places Meir within the framework of the American immigrant experience, the Holocaust, and the single-mindedness of a generation that carved a nation out of its own nightmares and dreams. She paints a vivid portrait of a legendary woman defined by contradictions: an iron resolve coupled with magnetic charm, an utter ordinariness of appearance matched to extraordinary achievements, a kindly demeanor that disguised a stunning hard-heartedness, and a complete dedication to her country that often overwhelmed her personal relationships. To produce this definitive account of Meir's life, Burkett mined historical records never before examined by any researcher, and interviewed members of Meir's inner circle, many going on record for the first time. The result is an astounding portrait of one of the most commanding political presences of the twentieth century-a woman whose uncompromising commitment to the creation and preservation of a Jewish state fueled and framed the ideological conflicts that still define Middle Eastern relations today.	2008-04-29	Harper						ZZZ000000

Rabbi Julia Neuberger assesses the situation in the UK from her own unique viewpoint and draws some challenging and thought-provoking conclusions.Just as Will Hutton looked at the political landscape at a turning point in Britain, Rabbi Julia will take the moral temperature of the nation by looking at the ways in which we treat the weakest amongst us. The National Health Service, government pensions and asylum seekers all make daily headlines, and here is a writer with the moral authority and mastery of the necessary information to undertake this timely project.The way we treat the weak and vulnerable members of society has long been an established way to judge how civilised a society is. In this book, Julia looks at the extent to which the elderly are thought a burden, the way we care for the mentally ill, attitudes to asylum seekers and support for ex-offenders, as well as the care of children and the future of society in the UK.Her straight-forward approach to what has elsewhere proven highly esoteric, is here written with ease and fluidity and with a style that is highly approachable for those interested in the state of their nation with purely social, rather than academic, motivations.With her uncomplicated but extremely intelligent and candid take on the issues that make daily headlines, and with Julia's high media profile, this book is guaranteed to tap into the state of our nation.Includes exciting new sections, reviewing the past year's events, reception to her book and what - if anything - has changed in the way she sees our nation's moral predicament.	2006-05-02	Harper Perennial						ZZZ000000

Johnson		The long-awaited final volume of Chalmers Johnson's bestselling Blowback trilogy confronts the overreaching of the American empire and the threat it poses to the republic In his prophetic book Blowback , Chalmers Johnson linked the CIA's clandestine activities abroad to disaster at home. In The Sorrows of Empire, he explored the ways in which the growth of American militarism and the garrisoning of the planet have jeopardized our stability. Now, in Nemesis , he shows how imperial overstretch is undermining the republic itself, both economically and politically. Delving into new areas'from plans to militarize outer space to Constitution-breaking presidential activities at home and the devastating corruption of a toothless Congress' Nemesis offers a striking description of the trap into which the dreams of America's leaders have taken us. Drawing comparisons to empires past, Johnson explores in vivid detail just what the unintended consequences of our dependence on a permanent war economy are likely to be. What does it mean when a nation's main intelligence organization becomes the president's secret army? Or when the globe's sole "hyperpower," no longer capable of paying for the vaulting ambitions of its leaders, becomes the greatest hyper-debtor of all times? In his stunning conclusion, Johnson suggests that financial bankruptcy could herald the breakdown of constitutional government in America'a crisis that may ultimately prove to be the only path to a renewed nation. In his book Blowback , Chalmers Johnson linked the CIA''s clandestine activities abroad to disaster at home. In The Sorrows of Empire , he explored how the growth of American militarism and the garrisoning of the planet have actually jeopardized our safety. Now, in Nemesis , the final volume in what has become the Blowback Trilogy, he shows how imperial overstretch is undermining the republic itself, both economically and politically. Drawing comparisons to the Roman and British empires, Johnson explores in vivid detail just what the unintended consequences of our dependence on a permanent war economy are likely to be. Nemesis details the world of secrecy surrounding Capitol Hill, from government-sanctioned domestic spying, to unacknowledged CIA prisoners, to the dubious budgeting that backs it all up. Johnson documents the crippling militarism that has left what was once the greatest industrial power in the world producing mainly weaponry, and the corruption of a toothless Congress that is undermining the checks and balances so crucial to American democracy. In his stunning conclusion, Johnson suggests that a coming financial bankruptcy could herald the breakdown of constitutional government in America'a crisis that may ultimately prove to be the only path to a renewed nation. " Nemesis provides fascinating information about the Department of Defense''s practices, many of which have received little Congressional oversight and no public scrutiny. Relentless and resourceful, Mr. Johnson draws on obscure publications . . . to blow the whistle on the Pentagon''s vast network of military bases, Status of Forces Agreements, and weapons designed to destroy the surveillance satellites of other countries."' Glenn C. Altschuler, The New York Observer "When Johnson mines the recent history he has studied and experienced firsthand, the results are bracing . . .

Tim Rutten, Los Angeles Times "A well-written, detailed and stimulating display of the radical anti-imperialist critique of American foreign policy . . . Nemesis is good in sounding the alarm.

9780805081824	The Supreme Court,the personalities and rivalries that defined America	Jeffrey Rosen		A leading Supreme Court expert recounts the personal and philosophical rivalries that forged our nation's highest court and continue to shape our daily lives"The Supreme Court" is the most mysterious branch of government, and yet the Court is at root a human institution, made up of very bright people with very strong egos, for whom political and judicial conflicts often become personal.In this compelling work of character-driven history, Jeffrey Rosen recounts the history of the Court through the personal and philosophical rivalries on the bench that transformed the law--and by extension, our lives. The story begins with the great Chief Justice John Marshall and President Thomas Jefferson, cousins from the Virginia elite whose differing visions of America set the tone for the Court's first hundred years. The tale continues after the Civil War with Justices John Marshall Harlan and Oliver Wendell Holmes, who clashed over the limits of majority rule. Rosen then examines the Warren Court era through the lens of the liberal icons Hugo Black and William O. Douglas, for whom personality loomed larger than ideology. He concludes with a pairing from our own era, the conservatives William H. Rehnquist and Antonin Scalia, only one of whom was able to build majorities in support of his views.Through these four rivalries, Rosen brings to life the perennial conflict that has animated the Court--between those justices guided by strong ideology and those who forge coalitions and adjust to new realities. He illuminates the relationship between judicial temperament and judicial success or failure. The stakes are nothing less than the future of American jurisprudence. Jeffrey Rosen is a professor of law at George Washington University and the legal affairs editor of The New Republic. He is the author of "The Most Democratic Branch," "The Naked Crowd," and "The Unwanted Gaze." His articles have appeared in many publications, including "The New York Times Magazine," "The Atlantic Monthly," and "The New Yorker." He is a frequent contributor to National Public Radio and lives in Washington, D.C.

While Rosen's book and the TV series are largely about the court's past, the subject of greatest interest right now is the court's future. Both series and book give us a glimpse of that through interviews with [Chief Justice] Roberts. They include reflections by the new chief on what can be learned from the court's history, what the chief justice's role ought to be, and how he hopes to execute that role during his tenure.The final chapter of Rosen's book is devoted almost entirely to Roberts's views.

Rare is the book I'd call a must-read for every Supreme Court justice and every president and senator faced with the awesome tasks of nominating or confirming one--as well as for every citizen who cares about what's at stake. This is just such a book."--Laurence Tribe "It was all very well for John Adams to say that the great political goal is 'a government of laws and not of men.' But government, emphatically including the judicial branch, "is "men and women. In this lively, nuanced history, Jeffrey Rosen, one of America's most acute writers on constitutional law, shows how clashes of large personalities have shaped conflicts about important principles."--George F. Will "Jeffrey Rosen has written a superb and accessible history of the Supreme Court and, in doing so, has given readers an opportunity to understand both the past and the present importance of the institution."--Alan Brinkley "Jeffrey Rosen, one of our most astute observers of the Supreme Court, understands that personalities can play a critical role in deciding American law. His arresting new book focuses on some of the most dramatic and consequential chapters in American legal history, depicting them as deeply human events in which temperament as well as legal philosophy came to the fore."--Sean Wilentz "Authoritative analysis of how the justices' 'quirks of personality and temperament' have shaped American law and made the Court one of our strongest institutions. Rosen traces the Court's evolution through the stories of four pairs of personalities and their clashes over important issues. The most successful justices, he argues, have been 'institutionalists': effective leaders and consensus-builders who are modest, likable, able to find common ground and more concerned about the legitimacy of the Court than their own interests and agendas. The least successful justices have been insecure, heavy-handed 'loners' more interested in personal glory than in quietly getting things done. Specialists will appreciate Rosen's examinations of these conflicting judicial temperaments at play during different periods in history . . . The basic differences animating these clashing duos are made clear. Crafty and appealing Chief Justice John Marshall managed time after time to outfox his introverted, thin-skinned political opponent, Thomas Jefferson. Gregarious Justice John Marshall Harlan won out on the issue of majority rule over darker, more ideological Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. The persuasive Hugo Black, deeply devoted to the institution of the Court, proved far more influential on key issues than undisciplined, self-destructive William O. Douglas. Of modern conservative justices, Rosen finds that the pragmatic William H. Rehnquist was much more respected within the Court than Antonin Scalia, a rigid purist. A concluding chapter based on an interview with Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr., suggests that he may have the temperament of his successful predecessors. An illuminating look at the human side of the highest court."--"Kirkus Reviews" "Rosen uses a historical context to examine the influence of judicial temperament on the tenures of some of the most influential Supreme Court justices. The author is a law professor at George Washington University as well as legal affairs editor at the New Republic, but the book is concise and free of legal jargon. In each chapter, Rosen compares and contrasts the personalities and backgrounds of one pair of historical figures, beginning with John Marshall and Thomas Jefferson and ending with current justice Antonin Scalia and the late chief justice William Rehnquist. Rosen's approach to judicial decision making is informative . . . [A] solid work."--"Library Journal"	2007	Macmillan						ZZZ000000

Politics, people, events and objects are all covered,;Tintin, the extraordinary reporter with his immediately recognizable coif and his dog Snowy, has been a publishing phenomenon since he first appeared in 1928. Herge, Tintin's creator, based the stories on actual events in his world, reflecting the political tensions of the 1930s and postwar events. The Anschluss and the Japanese invasion of Manchuria, the race to the moon, our Western fascination with the Abominable Snowman, the spying activities of Buster Crabbe, the revolutionary activities of Regis Bebray in South America, are just a few of the people, events and phenomena to crop up, inimitably satirized, in Herge's stories. He also drew on real objects: the aircraft, ships, guns, cars, clothes, buildings and so forth, that appear in his stories are scrupulously correct, and were often updated in subsequent editions.;This book explains the sources, of whatever kind, of all the stories. It also shows how Herge subtly adjusted the stories in new editions, adapting them to changing times and ideas, and downplaying their originally local, Belgian origins.	2001-01	John Murray						ZZZ000000

But when a shadowy right-wing group starts flooding America's emergency rooms with dead and dying, Beamon is summoned back to Washington. Teamed with an icily efficient female field agent, he is given the thankless task of stopping the slaughter--even though millions of Americans secretly approve of it. As the body count rises, Beamon realizes there is something eerily familiar about his adversary, reminding him of the coldest killer he ever encountered - not a criminal but a law enforcement colleague. And for the first time, he wonders why he was chosen for this assignment. Was it his expertise - or his expendability?	2003-05-26	Coronet						ZZZ000000

This all-new low carbohydrate diet moves on from Dr Atkins, cutting out the unhealthy side-effects of that diet and including a wider range of healthy foods than Atkins or any of his successors. The No Grain diet offers three plans tailored to suit your needs: The booster plan (to ease you more gently into the plan), the core plan (for faster results), and the advanced plan (for those who need to lose a lot of weight fast for health reasons). What's more, it presents a unique psychological technique to combat cravings, bolster your self-belief and help you ride low periods, which usually lead you to break the diet. With delicious recipes and advice on additional factors to further support your new healthy lifestyle, The No Grain Diet is the last diet book you'll ever need.	2005-01-03	Hodder Mobius						ZZZ000000

In the course of her work, she has heard many amazing stories from patients close to death and from the relatives of the deceased. These accounts have confirmed Dr Amatuzio's belief that, contrary to the prevailing atttitude in the medical community, which states that death is merely the absence of life, some part of the person's spirit indeed goes on. In this collection are stories of profound mysteries and inexplicable coincidences - such as the patient who on the day of his death insisted that he had been visited by a friend forty years dead -, and incredible synchronicities - such as the two daughters, thousands of miles apart, who experienced unexplained sensations at the precise moment their father passed away. Heartfelt, deeply moving and ultimately uplifting in its message of hope and comfort, this is truly a dispatch from the front line of the mysteries of life and death.	2006-04-10	Hodder Mobius						ZZZ000000

Interviews, diary entries, and case studies explain what became of the two Panchen Lamas and shed light on the mysteries of Tibetan medicine and a culture that is alive in the hearts of its people.	2005	Tara-India Research Press						ZZZ000000

She lives in New York City. She is the author of The Handbook of Classical Literature, Ancient Myth in Modern Poetry, and Madness in Literature.  Naipaul's Truth: The Making of a Writer V. S. Naipaul once described his purpose as an author as nothing less than a ""commitment to deliver the truth."" One of the world's greatest, and most controversial, living writers, he has written extensively about the enduring economic, cultural, and psychological effects of colonialism, particularly its assaults on individual identity. In Naipaul's Truth, Lillian Feder, noted author of several classic works of literary criticism, explores Naipaul's writings to deliver an original and beautifully written analysis of her subject. Feder describes Naipaul's methods for discovering the truth about himself and the world he explores, and she concludes that Naipaul's literature has rightfully earned a place in the upper echelons of the modern canon. Simultaneously an intellectual biography and a revealing psychological portrait of the artist, Naipaul's Truth is a masterpiece of literary biography.  ""It is hard to be fair to V. S. Naipaul's books: they challenge readers in contentiousness. A neutral or disinterested reading seems pointless. Most critics of Naipaul think they must hand down a political verdict. Lillian Feder never forgets that the novels are works of art or they are nothing. She engages with Naipaul's political essays and examines their relation to the corresponding fictions. Immensely helpful work, this. I hope that readers will learn from her patience and from the quality and force of her intelligence.""

9780801880216	The Einstein almanac	Alice Calaprice		Albert Einstein was an exceptional human being. Perhaps nothing reflects the breadth and scope of his brilliance, his interests, and his influence better than his publications -- more than six hundred scientific papers, books, essays, reviews, and opinion pieces. Einstein began publishing in March 1901 with a scientific work that appeared in the German journal Annalen der Physik when he was twenty-two; the last publication was an editorial in the journal Common Cause which appeared a few months before his death in 1955. In the fifty-four-year interval, his published work ranged widely over relativity theory and quantum physics, nationalism, Judaism, war, peace, and education. Indeed, Einstein's literary output was so abundant that even many of his most informed admirers are not familiar with all of it.The Einstein Almanac takes a look at Einstein's year-by-year output, explaining his three-hundred most important publications and setting them into the context of his life, science, and world history. Concentrating primarily on Einstein's scientific and humanitarian writings, Alice Calaprice summarizes most of the papers and describes meaningful events surrounding their publication, including Einstein's personal life, his travels, the work of other scientists, social and cultural developments at the time, and national and international events. Enjoyable and informative, The Einstein Almanac provides a unique perspective on Einstein's genius -- and his humanity.	2005	JHU Press						ZZZ000000
9780719564055	The smile of Murugan,a south Indian journey	Michael Wood		Some time in the future you will come back here to Chindambaram and you will make a pilgrimage, said the astrologer to Michael Wood as they sat in a small airless house in Tamil Nadu. It is the most important thing you will do. Four years later Michael found himself on a pilgrim bus heading southwards on a journey of more than a thousand miles through the temples and holy shrines of Southern India. The bone-shaking bus, its aisle crammed with passengers on folding chairs and its video showing glimpses of old films through a blaring snowstorm of white static, would transport him into another world and time where the rituals at the spiritual heart of India are still observed as they were a thousand years ago, existing side by side with all the trappings of the modern world. As his many admirers know, Michael Wood is the perfect travelling companion, eyes and ears wide open, knowledgeable yet eager to learn. His touching and humorous account of this inner and outer journey captures both the life-enhancing spirit of Hinduism and the essence of India itself.	2002-04-18	John Murray						ZZZ000000
9780719561672	The Hunt for Zerzura,The Lost Oasis and the Desert War	Saul Kelly		This is a study of the true story behind The English Patient, one of the least known and most extraordinary episodes of World War II. In the 1930s, the Zerzura Club (named after a lost oasis in the Libyan desert) met once a year for dinner at the Cafe Royal in London. Ostensibly, its members were cosmopolitan adventurers indulging a craze for desert travel by motor car and aeroplane, and searching for the lost oases and ancient cities of a vanished civilization. In reality they were mapping the desert for military reasons, marking vital wells and checking terrain. The Club's members were drawn from countries that would soon be enemies, and fellowship masked a vicious rivalry. Mussolini hoped to make Egypt the centrepiece of a new Italian empire, but the British - for whom the Suez Canal was strategically vital - were determined to hold onto that country. When war broke out in 1939, Ralph Bagnold founded the Long Range Desert Group to spy on and disrupt the Axis powers' advance on Cairo under Rommel, while his fellow club member Count Almasy tried to spirit the Egyptian Chief of Staff out of Cairo, and succeeded in inserting German spies. Both of them were using knowledge and desert craft drawn from the hazardous hunt for the Zerzura Oasis, where each had deceived the other about his true purpose. In telling this story, Saul Kelly draws on interviews with survivors as well as previously unknown documentary material in Britain, Italy, Germany, Hungary and Egypt. His book reads like a thriller by John Buchan or Frederick Forsyth - with one key difference: it is true.	2003-06-19	John Murray						ZZZ000000
9780719561726	Parting the Desert,The Creation of the Suez Canal	Zachary Karabell		The idea of a canal linking the mediterranean with the Indian Ocean began with Napoleon Bonaparte but was masterminded by the French diplomat Ferdinand de Lesseps, who won a concession from the ruler of Egypt. Lesseps then travelled throughout Europe to raise money, and managed to win the support of Louis Napoleon and neutralize the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire. Although a persuasive public-speaker, he however never convinced Lord Palmerston, one of the towering figures of Victorian England, who was determined to prevent the canal's completion. To carry out the enormous engineering project, Lesseps used both old tools and new ones: he set up a modern company governed by shareholders, but took advantage of forced labour, and he hired the best engineers of the day who designed machines to excavate the 100-mile long canal. The creation of the Suez Canal captured the imagination of the world, heralded as a symbol of progress that would unite East and West, but its legacy is mixed. It was supposed to strengthen the Middle East and bridge cultures; instead the gap widened, and the new trade link between West and East had enormous repercussions.	2004-02-16	John Murray						ZZZ000000
9780719563416	Wild West China,the untold story of a frontier land	Christian Tyler		Known by the Chinese as a barbarian land, its rich past conjures up sand-buried cities and painted caves, while its present is punctuated by violence and warfare. And now it is returning to the light. The picture it presents is both fascinating and disturbing. The Uighurs, still farm the tranquil oases that ring the dreaded Taklamakan, the world's second largest sand desert, and the Kazakh and Kirghiz herdsmen still roam the mountains. The region's history, however, has been punctuated by violence, usually provoked by ambitious outsiders - nomad chieftains from the north, Muslim emirs from Central Asia, Russian generals or warlords from inner China. Only in the 1760s did the Chinese subdue the region, and even then their rule was repreatedly broken. China's colonization of Xinjiang has been late and difficult. The Communists have done most to develop it, as a penal colony, as a buffer against invasion, and as a supplier of raw materials and living space for an overpopulated country. But what China sees as its property, the Uighurs regards as theft by an alien occupier. Tension has led to violence and savage reprisals.	2004-07-22	John Murray						ZZZ000000
9780719565083	Stalin's last crime,the doctors' plot	Jonathan Brent&Vladimir Pavlovich Naumov		On 13th January 1953, a stunned world learned that a vast conspiracy among Jewish doctors to murder Kremlin leaders had been unmasked. Pravda reported that several of the doctors had confessed to the crime. Mass arrests followed. The Doctors' Plot, as this action came to be called, was Stalin's last great criminal conspiracy. In the years since Stalin's death many myths have grown about it, while Stalin's own motives have been the object of endless speculation. Did he himself invent it or was it engineered by subordinates who wished to eliminate Kremlin rivals? Was Stalin motivated by venomous anti-Semitism? How was this plot related to the Cold War then raging in Europe and the war in Korea? And, finally, was the Doctors' Plot connected with Stalin's convenient death? Through access to previously unseen Soviet documents, this great conundrum of Cold War politics is unravelled for the first time.	2004-04-15	John Murray						ZZZ000000

9780719565694	Pol Pot,The History of a Nightmare	Philip Short		Pol Pot was an idealistic, reclusive figure with great charisma and personal charm. He initiated a revolution whose radical egalitarianism exceeded any other in history. But in the process, Cambodia desended into madness and his name became a byword for oppression. In the three-and-a-half years of his rule, more than a million people, a fifth of Cambodia's population, were executed or died from hunger and disease. A supposedly gentle, carefree land of slumbering temples and smiling peasants became a concentration camp of the mind, a slave state in which absolute obedience was enforced on the 'killing fields'. Why did it happen? How did an idealistic dream of justice and prosperity mutate into one of humanity's worst nightmares? Philip Short, the biographer of Mao, has spent four years travelling the length Cambodia, interviewing surviving leaders of Pol Pot's Khmer Rouge movement and sifting through previously closed archives. Here, the former Khmer Rouge Head of State, Pol's brother-in-law and scores of lesser figures speak for the first time at length about their beliefs and motives.	2005	John Murray						ZZZ000000

Armstrong had pledged to win a record-breaking sixth consecutive Tour; a feat no one had achieved in the event's 100-year lifetime.

9780719567520	Beasts of no nation,a novel	Uzodinma Iweala		In this stunning debut novel, Agu, a young boy in an unnamed West African nation, is recruited into a unit of guerrilla fighters as civil war engulfs his country. Haunted by his father's own death at the hands of militants, which he fled just before witnessing, Agu is vulnerable to the dangerous yet paternal nature of his new commander. While the war rages on, Agu becomes increasingly divorced from the life he had known before the conflict started -- a life of school friends, church services, and time with his family still intact. As he vividly recalls these sunnier times, his daily reality spins further downward into inexplicable brutality, primal fear, and loss of selfhood. His relationship with his commander deepens even as it darkens, and his camaraderie with a fellow soldier lends a deceptive sense of normalcy to his experience. In a powerful, strikingly original voice that vividly captures Agu's youth and confusion, Uzodinma Iweala has produced a harrowing, deeply affecting novel. Both a searing take on coming-of-age and a vivid document of the dark face of war, Beasts of No Nation announces the arrival of an extraordinary new writer.	2005-08-15	HarperCollins Publishers						ZZZ000000

Hitler had secretly determined that the Games would showcase Nazi prowess and, when they arrived in Berlin, the unwitting athletes found themselves to be helpless pawns in his sinister political game." "For the first time Guy Walters reveals how it was not only the Nazis who corrupted the Games, but the Olympic officials themselves, not least Baron Pierre de Coubertin, the founder of the modern Olympics, who received a massive secret donation from the Nazis." "From the remarkable tableau of the Games themselves, Walters stretches the story across a broad canvas, placing those two crucial weeks in the wider context of the 1930s. He brings alive a wide cast of characters and a complex political backdrop, and casts new light on a momentous yet little explored set piece of Nazi history."--BOOK JACKET.	2006-07-27	John Murray						ZZZ000000
9780719566752	Apartheid's friends,the rise and fall of South Africa's secret service	James Sanders		Very little has been written about the South African secret intelligence, but revelations to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and the new culture of confessions now make that possible. James Sanders has gathered classified documents and interviewed ex-operatives since 1997 and has pieced together an extraordinary, unsavoury picture of the Intelligence Service, both inside South Africa and overseas. He reveals evidence of state-sponsored murder not only to intimidate the ANC but also to allow hard men within the police and the armed forces to let off steam. He reveals that Republican political candidates in the US were assisted in elections against anti-Apartheid Democrats. He shows that South Africa supplied Argentina with weapons during the Falklands War and that Harold Wilson's surprising outbursts, when he claimed that South African intelligence agents were trying to bring down his government, were based on hard evidence. At operational level, South African Intelligence had intimate links with counterparts in the CIA, British Intelligence, and other agencies worldwide. Apartheid's Friends not only provides an insight into a dark area of South Africa's past, it is also an important contribution to the international history of secret service.	2006-08-31	John Murray						ZZZ000000
9780719569432	Bad Dates,True Tales from Single Life	Sam Jordison		Charting the extraordinary encounters ordinary people around the world have undergone in the name of love, Bad Dates lays bare (in more ways than one) the ritual of humiliation that is dating. The horrific tales it contains are sometimes embarrassing, often rude, and always absolutely hilarious; proving conclusively that for every match made in heaven, there are dozens more made in hell. From the man who had information about his underpants emailed to his entire office, to the couple who found their passions doused by an unexpected dip in a lake, via the girl who ruptured her stomach when over-indulging at an all-you-can-eat restaurant, these stories are a much-needed answer to the icky clichegrave;s normally surrounding romance. So, if you have loved and lost, crashed and burned, been humiliated, betrayed, abused and bemused, this is undoubtedly the book for you. And even if you haven't, you'll still enjoy laughing at all the fools who have.	2006-11-02	John Murray						ZZZ000000

9780719564994	American Shogun	Robert Harvey		From the mid-nineteenth century on, America and Japan were caught in an extraordinary political, military and economic duel. This clash was characterised by a cultural incompatibility that was to haunt the negotiations of their two leaders, Emperor Hirohito and General MacArthur. Hirohito was a remarkable man. Diffident, uncharismatic and apparently obtuse, he survived as god-ruler of Japan for six decades through internal strife, war, defeat, occupation and economic victory. But Hirohito met his equal in MacArthur. Brash and domineering, MacArthur merited the honorary Japanese epithet shogun or 'army leader' for his almost single-handed six year rule over Japan. In this absorbing dual biography Robert Harvey traces their tense and complex relationship. His broad scope encompasses two great nations in war and peace a momentous period of history which provides illuminating insight into American actions across the world today.	2007-03-22	John Murray						ZZZ000000
9780719562518	Prisoner of Tehran,the end of childhood in Iran	Marina Nemat		Includes 16 black and white photos. Brought up as a Christian, Marina Nemat's peaceful childhood in Tehran was shattered when the Iranian Revolution of 1979 ushered in a new era of Islamic rule. After complaining to her teachers about her Maths lessons being replaced by Koran study, Marina was arrested late one evening. She was taken to the notorious prison, Evin, where interrogation and torture were part of the daily routine. Aged sixteen, she was sentenced to death. Her prison guard snatched her from the firing squad bullets but exacted a shocking price in return: marriage to him and conversion to Islam. Marina lived out her prison days as his secret bride, spending nights with him in a separate cell. Marina struggled to reconcile her hatred towards Ali and her feelings of physical repulsion with the fact that he had saved her life. When Ali was murdered by his enemies from Evin, and saved Marina's life for a second time, her feelings were complicated even further. At last she was able to return home, to her family and her past life, but silence surrounded her time as a political prisoner and the regime kept her under constant surveillance. Marina's world had been changed forever.	2007	John Murray						ZZZ000000
9780719564239	The last oil shock,a survival guide to the imminent extinction of Petroleum Man	David Strahan		This may be the most important book you or anyone else will read in the next fifty years. Assuming humanity survives that long. Draining the lifeblood of industrial civilization, the terminal decline of oil and gas production will spark a crisis far more dangerous than international terrorism, and more urgent than climate change. World leaders know it, so why aren't they telling? The last oil shock is the secret behind the crises in Iraq and Iran, the reason your gas bill is going through the roof, the basis of a secret deal cooked up in Texas between George Bush and Tony Blair, the cause of an imminent and unprecedented economic collapse, and the reason you may soon be kissing your car keys and boarding pass goodbye. David Strahan explains how we reached this critical state, how the silence of governments, oil companies and environmentalists conspires to keep the public in the dark, what it means for energy policy, and what you can do to protect yourself and your family from the ravages of the last oil shock.	2007-04-19	John Murray						ZZZ000000
9780719568121	Simplexity,The simple rules of a complex world	Jeffrey Kluger		Why does kicking the TV work? What can the US military learn from the lowly bacterium? Why are the instruction manuals for cell phones incomprehensible? How does a spark of a single virus trigger an epidemic that claims millions? In recent years, cutting-edge studies in fields such as economics, genetics, stock-market analysis and child development have hit on a startling new theory 'simplexity'. To put it simply, simple things can be more complicated than they seem, and complex things more simple. The evidence is before our eyes: in your elaborate network of household plumbing actually run on a very basic mechanism, or the crystal paperweight on your desk, spectacular in its complexity. As simplexity moves from the research lab into popular consciousness it will challenge our models for modern living. You'll never unknowingly whack the TV again and you'll understand just how much it means to smile at your child. Popular science journalist Jeffrey Kluger adeptly translates cutting-edge theory into a high-octane history of everything, which will have you rethinking the rules of business and pleasure. From the micro to the macro, Simplexity is a startling reassessment of the building blocks of life and how they affect us all.	2007-08-09	John Murray						ZZZ000000
9780719564642	Super crunchers,how anything can be predicted	Ian Ayres		Companies used to rely on human experts and their years of experience to guide them. Now, cutting-edge organizations are mining the data and crunching numbers instead, to come up with more accurate, less biased predictions. As Freakonomics detailed, statistical analysis can reveal the secret levers of causation. But economist Ian Ayres argues that that's only part of the story: super crunching is revolutionizing the way we all make decisions. Beginning with examples of the mathematician who out-predicted wine buffs in determining the best vintages, and the sports scouts who now use statistics rather than intuition to pick winners, Super Crunchers exposes the world of data-miners, introducing the people and the techniques. It illuminates the hidden patterns all around us. No businessperson, academic, student, or consumer (statistically that's everyone) should make another move without getting to grips with thinking-by-numbers -" the new way to be smart, savvy and statistically superior.	2007-09-06	John Murray						ZZZ000000

They make life interesting and human beings (some more than others) have a genuine flair for them. So why does history only record the worlds dull and worthy achievements? Annus Horribilis sets the record straight by celebrating good old-fashioned failures. From the man whose spectacular escape from prison was spoiled when he was eaten by a crocodile to the husband who choked to death on his own wife, via several exploding whales, numerous celebrity meltdowns and countless predictions that proved to be wholly inaccurate, Annus Horribilis proves once and for all, that theres no success like failure.	2007-11-15	John Murray						HUM000000
9780719563027	The slave ship,a human history	Marcus Rediker		The slave ship was the instrument of history's greatest forced migration and a key to the origins and growth of global capitalism, yet much of its history remains unknown. Marcus Rediker uncovers the extraordinary human drama that played out on this world-changing vessel. Drawing on thirty years of maritime research, he demonstrates the truth of W.E.B DuBois's observation: the slave trade was 'the most magnificent drama in the last thousand years of human history'. The Slave Ship focuses on the so-called 'golden age' of the slave trade, the period of 1700-1808, when more than six million people were transported out of Africa, most of them on British and American ships, across the Atlantic, to slave on New World plantations. Marcus Rediker tells poignant tales of life, death and terror as he captures the shipboard drama of brutal discipline and fierce resistance. He reconstructs the lives of individuals, such as John Newton, James Field Stanfield and Olaudah Equiano, and the collective experience of captains, sailors and slaves. Mindful of the haunting legacies of race, class and slavery, Marcus Rediker offers a vivid and unforgettable portrait of the ghost ship of our modern consciousness.	2007	John Murray						ZZZ000000
9780719560071	Inside the Red Mansion,On the Trail of China's Most Wanted Man	Oliver August		In 1999, shortly after arriving in Beijing as The Times's China correspondent, Oliver August set out on the trail of China's most wanted man, Lai Changxing. An illiterate peasant from the coastal city of Xiamen, Lai created his own shipping empire from nothing before vanishing abruptly when the Communist Party accused him of corruption and fraud. Once the richest man in the country, Lai was now public enemy number one becauseAcirc; his immense wealth became a threat to Beijing's power. Oliver August's highly entertaining search for Lai takes him to the brothels, backwaters and boardrooms that define the spirit of an emerging nation. Fascinated by Lai's story, the author visits the town where he was born, travels on the boat used by his smuggling racket and stays in the hotel where government investigators interrogated and tortured his helpers. The book investigates the tycoon's meteoric rise, his catastrophic demise and the mystery that surrounds his disappearance. After two decades of capitalist reforms, the New China seems to have more clichAtilde;copy;s than people. Both free and oppressive, anarchic and authoritarian, totally chaotic yet highly regulated, China is changing completely whilst seeming to stay itself. Part investigation, part personal memoir, Inside the Red Mansion is a deeply atmospheric journey into the New China. From the austere bureaucrats of Beijing to the gilded pirate coast opposite Taiwan; from the Gobi desert plains where migrant labour is recruited, to the skyscrapers and nightclubs of boomtowns like Xiamen, Oliver August's gripping yet thoughtful account reveals the dark side of China's economic miracle and a nation finally awakening to its desires.	2008	John Murray						TRV003020
9780691122250	Success through failure,the paradox of design	Henry Petroski		Design pervades our lives. Everything from drafting a PowerPoint presentation to planning a state-of-the-art bridge embodies this universal human activity. But what makes a great design? In this compelling and wide-ranging look at the essence of invention, distinguished engineer and author Henry Petroski argues that, time and again, we have built success on the back of failure--not through easy imitation of success.Success through Failure shows us that making something better--by carefully anticipating and thus averting failure--is what invention and design are all about. Petroski explores the nature of invention and the character of the inventor through an unprecedented range of both everyday and extraordinary examples--illustrated lectures, child-resistant packaging for drugs, national constitutions, medical devices, the world's tallest skyscrapers, long-span bridges, and more. Stressing throughout that there is no surer road to eventual failure than modeling designs solely on past successes, he sheds new light on spectacular failures, from the destruction of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge in 1940 and the space shuttle disasters of recent decades, to the collapse of the World Trade Center in 2001. Petroski also looks at the prehistoric and ancient roots of many modern designs. The historical record, especially as embodied in failures, reveals patterns of human social behavior that have implications for large structures like bridges and vast organizations like NASA. Success through Failure--which will fascinate anyone intrigued by design, including engineers, architects, and designers themselves--concludes by speculating on when we can expect the next major bridge failure to occur, and the kind of bridge most likely to be involved.	2006	Princeton University Press						ZZZ000000
9780691124926	Fearless symmetry,exposing the hidden patterns of numbers	Avner Ash&Robert Gross		Mathematicians solve equations, or try to. But sometimes the solutions are not as interesting as the beautiful symmetric patterns that lead to them. Written in a friendly style for a general audience,Fearless Symmetryis the first popular math book to discuss these elegant and mysterious patterns and the ingenious techniques mathematicians use to uncover them. Hidden symmetries were first discovered nearly two hundred years ago by French mathematician Eacute;variste Galois. They have been used extensively in the oldest and largest branch of mathematics--number theory--for such diverse applications as acoustics, radar, and codes and ciphers. They have also been employed in the study of Fibonacci numbers and to attack well-known problems such as Fermat's Last Theorem, Pythagorean Triples, and the ever-elusive Riemann Hypothesis. Mathematicians are still devising techniques for teasing out these mysterious patterns, and their uses are limited only by the imagination. The first popular book to address representation theory and reciprocity laws,Fearless Symmetryfocuses on how mathematicians solve equations and prove theorems. It discusses rules of math and why they are just as important as those in any games one might play. The book starts with basic properties of integers and permutations and reaches current research in number theory. Along the way, it takes delightful historical and philosophical digressions. Required reading for all math buffs, the book will appeal to anyone curious about popular mathematics and its myriad contributions to everyday life.	2006	Princeton University Press						ZZZ000000
9780231138703	More than you know,finding financial wisdom in unconventional places	Michael J. Mauboussin		LEARN HOW GREAT INVESTORS THINK Michael J. Mauboussin is known throughout the financial world for his innovative approach to succeeding on Wall Street. His unconventional methods have earned him a place on Smart Money's list of the "Most Influential People on Wall Street" and in the Wall Street Journal's All-Star survey. In More Than You Know, Mauboussin shares his secret to becoming an insightful investor and provides invaluable tools to better understand the concepts of choice and risk. Mauboussin develops sound investment strategies by drawing on diverse sources and disciplines. He builds on the ideas of sage yet diverse visionaries including Warren Buffett and E. O. Wilson, but he also finds wisdom in a range of activities and fields that is both broad and deep, including: casino gambling, horse racing, psychology, and evolutionary biology. He analyzes the strategies of poker experts David Sklansky and Puggy Pearson and pinpoints parallels between mate selection in guppies and stock market booms. Ant colonies, Tupperware parties, "hot hands" in basketball, slime mold, and Tiger Woods's swing all have something to tell us about smart investing. More Than You Know is written with the professional investor in mind but extends far beyond the world of economics and finance. Mauboussin groups the essays into four categories: Investment Philosophy, Psychology of Investing, Innovation and Competitive Strategy, and Science and Complexity Theory, and he includes useful references for further reading on the topics he discusses. A true eye-opener, More Than You Know shows how a multidisciplinary approach that pays close attention to process and the psychology of decision making offers the best chance for long-term financial results.	2006	Columbia University Press						ZZZ000000

9780224077811	I Believe in Yesterday,My Living Hell in Living History	Tim Moore		An odyssey through 2,000 years of filth and fury, where men were men, the nights were black, the world was your outside toilet and everything tasted faintly of leeks. In 1989, Tim Moore moved into the last house in Chiswick with an outside toilet. Intrigued by a subsequent encounter with an elderly former resident, and shamed to confess the phobic haste with which he demolished this facility, he finds himself inspired to travel back to the land before now, experiencing the horny-handed hardships and homespun pleasures enjoyed and endured by Moores gone by. The journey that follows takes him through the world of historical re-enactment, sitting at the bare and grubby feet of retromaniacs who have seen their future in the past, and learning their singular ways. Living on bramble leaves, Johnny cake and porridge, Moore travels from the Iron Age to the Steam Age. He shares straw beds and daft hats with period obsessives driven by socio-historical curiosity, disillusionment with the pampered fecklessness of the modern world, or a simple nostalgia for campfires, flatulence and brutality. Along the way he meets living historians for whom authenticity means pulling their own teeth out and dyeing outfits in urine, and those who stride back through time with a Nokia and a packet of fags stuffed down their codpiece.	2008-11-04	JONATHAN CAPE						ZZZ000000
9780224081542	The artist, the philosopher and the warrior,Leonardo, Machiavelli and Borgia : a fateful collusion	Paul Strathern		In this masterful study, Paul Strathern (author of The Medici, and Napoleon in Egypt) details the incidental convergence of three of Renaissance Italy's most brilliant minds.The Artist, the Philosopher and the Warrior follows Leonardo Da Vinci, Niccolo Machiavelli and Cesare Borgia through the mountains, remote villages and hill towns of the Italian Romagna. This was a period of extreme significance and considerable danger, not just for themselves, but for the country they were helping to shape. Borgia has become a byword for brutal and inhuman deeds, marred with the suspicion of incest. Depicted as a savage whose eyes were fixed on the prize of his own kingdom a province in which he ruled supreme. But he was an educated savage and an unrivalled tactician, relying on surprise and patience. Leonardo, possessed of the most inquisitive mind of his generation, is the exemplar of the Renaissance man. His paintings and drawings are among the finest and most famous in the world and his notebooks portray intricate scientific and technological investigations. But what led this master thinker to work for the tyrannical Borgia and how did he become involved with Machiavelli? Machiavelli was the infamous author of The Prince a work that was the culmination of all he had learnt throughout his long political career. Driven by an uncanny understanding of human nature, and the way people behave rather than how they ought to behave, Machiavelli became a master politician and diplomatic negotiator, unrivalled in Renaissance Italy. The legacies of these three men shaped the Renaissance and all that came after it and their impact is still felt today. Paul Strathern's new book is a vivid and gripping account of what happened in one short season in 1502.	2009	Jonathan Cape						ZZZ000000

9788186706473	Victims, Perpetrators or Actors? Gender, Armed Conflict and Political Violence	Caroline O. N. Moser&Fiona C Clark		This book provides a holistic analysis of the gendered nature of armed conflict and political violence, and in a broader understanding of the complex, changing roles and power relations between women and men during such circumstances, predominantly viewed as 'male domains', perpetrated by men acting as soldiers, guerillas, paramilitaries or peacemakers. The involvement of women has received far less attention, with a tendency to portray a simplistic division of roles between men as aggressors and women as victims, particularly of sexual abuse. Consequently the gendered causes, costs and consequences of violent conflicts have been, at best, under-represented and, most often, misrepresented.	2005	Zed Books ; Zubaan						ZZZ000000

Then the stick turned pink. Pink as in positive...as in pregnant...as in pure, unadulterated panic. This wasn't supposed to happen: she's scheduled to marry the handsome, successful, and very appropriate Ross Davis in six months. Unfortunately, while Ross may not rock her world with kitchen-table sex, his technique worked well enough to put a bun in her thirty something oven. Now instead of a fabulous rooftop apartment, fabulous clothes, and regular drinks with the girls, all she has is a nasty case of morning sickness, a future mother-in-law who's become obsessed with "Ross's Baby," and a custom designed wedding dress she'll soon be too fat to wear. Although she's trying to take some small comfort in the fact that one is never too bloated for a really cute purse, impending motherhood also has her reassessing more than her wardrobe--wondering if thirty-six more weeks is enough time for her to finish growing up.	2006-06-01	Kensington Books						ZZZ000000

9780753408575	Animal Homes	Angela Wilkes&Steve Weston		PreSchool-Grade 1-This series is to children's literature what instant pudding is to dessert. The books look good on the outside, have some of the elements of the real thing, will do if that's all that's available, but they just aren't as satisfying as well-crafted volumes. Each title is a collaborative effort by a different group of people whose names are tucked on the back of the title page in rather small type. Most of the illustrations are pedestrian at best. The photos are engaging but randomly sprinkled. The stories might be acceptable in a children's magazine but they don't save the rest of the slapdash content. Bright shiny covers and some pretty photos will lure well-meaning adults to this slick series, but with a little luck they will find better alternatives that don't try to cover too much with too little. -SCHOOL LIBRARY JOURNAL	2009	Kingfisher Publications, plc						ZZZ000000

9780751530803	Blowback,the costs and consequences of American empire	Chalmers Johnson		Blowback - a term originally coined by the CIA, to describe the unintended consequences of American policies. In his devastating critique, Chalmers Johnson shows how this concept has challenged America's superpower status in the twenty-first century.In essence, Blowback updates the old adage that you reap what you sow; except that in the case of US foreign policy, the American people are often unaware of what has been sown on their behalf. And while the US government condemns attacks against American citizens and property as being the work of 'terrorists' and 'rogue states', Johnson shows that they are often acts of blowback from earlier covert operations.Blowback is a much needed wake-up cal for American policy makers - a warning to demobilise the global empire before the full force of blowback takes effect.	2002	Time Warner						ZZZ000000

From a dawn visit to Billingsgate fish market with Helen, who came to Britain from St. Lucia in 1959, to a jasmine-scented Sri Lankan wedding ceremony in north London, Alagiah has brought colour and life to a subject that is all too often reduced to screaming tabloid headlines.

9780316727945	Endgame 1945,Victory, Retribution, Liberation	David Stafford		War does not end when the fighting stops, and military victory offers no guarantee of peace. Chaos and confusion accompanied the victory of allied forces over the Nazis. While they battled against last- ditch resistance from Nazis and their collaborators, allied forces encountered concentration camps and millions of slave labourers, caches of looted treasure and exhausted, bewildered refugees fleeing Stalin's armies and ethnic cleansing. The story begins on Friday, 20 April 1945, Hitler's birthday, when the Nazi dictator makes it clear he will fight on to the bitter end. It ends on Monday 16 July 1945, when Churchill tours Hitler's wrecked Chancellery and sees for himself the spot where the Fuhrer's body was burned. It is clear that the war is over. But peace is not yet in sight. Through eye-witness accounts from the archives, David Stafford paints a compelling portrait of a continent in turmoil and of the sobering balance sheet of victory.	2007-09-30	Little, Brown						ZZZ000000

But this was before he found himself in the more compromising position of being not only dead himself, but worse: dead with an exclusive still to file.From his position on high, Parlabane relates the events leading up to his demise, largely concerning the efforts of charismatic psychic Gabriel Lafayette to reconcile the scientific with the spiritual by submitting to controlled laboratory tests.Parlabane is brought in as an observer, due to his capacities as both a sceptic and an expert on deception, but he soon finds his certainties crumbling and his assumptions turned upside down as he encounters phenomena for which he can deduce no rational explanation. Perhaps, in a world in which he can find himself elected rector of an esteemed Scottish university, anything truly is possible.One thing he knows for certain, however:Death is not the end ? it's the ultimate undercover assignment.	2007-09-04	Little, Brown						ZZZ000000

Scars that Nick has seen before, five years earlier in Africa.Ancient religion and modern prejudice are about to collide, and when they do, there may be no survivors.

"Traveling in the changing cultures of South Asia, Mishra sees the pressures - the temptations - of Western-style modernity and prosperity, and adroitly teases out the paradoxes of globalization. A visit to Allahabad, the birth-place of Jawaharlal Nehru, occasions a brief history of the tumultuous post-independence politics Nehru set in motion. In Kashmir, just after the brutal killing of thirty-five Sikhs, he sees Muslim guerrillas playing with Sikh village children while the media ponder a (largely irrelevant) visit by President Clinton. And in Tibet he exquisitely parses the situation whereby the Chinese government - officially atheist and strongly opposed to a free Tibet - has discovered that Tibetan Buddhism can be "packaged and sold to tourists.""--BOOK JACKET.	2006-06	Picador						ZZZ000000

9780230709423	The Making of Modern Britain	Andrew Marr		In "The Making of Modern Britain," Andrew Marr paints a fascinating portrait of life in Britain during the first half of the twentieth century as the country recovered from the grand wreckage of the British Empire. Between the death of Queen Victoria and the end of the Second World War, the nation was shaken by war and peace. The two wars were the worst we had ever known and the episodes of peace among the most turbulent and surprising. As the political forum moved from Edwardian smoking rooms to an increasingly democratic Westminster, the people of Britain experimented with extreme ideas as they struggled to answer the question "How should we live?" Socialism? Fascism? Feminism? Meanwhile, fads such as eugenics, vegetarianism, and nudism were gripping the nation, while the popularity of the music hall soared. It was also a time that witnessed the birth of the media as we know it today and the beginnings of the welfare state. Beyond trenches, flappers, and Spitfires, this is a story of strange cults and economic madness, of revolutionaries and heroic inventors, sexual experiments and raucous stage heroines. From organic food to drugs, nightclubs and celebrities to package holidays, crooked bankers to sleazy politicians, the echoes of today's Britain ring from almost every page.	2009-10-01	Macmillan						ZZZ000000

Robert Service draws on hitherto unexamined archives and on his profound understanding of Russian history to draw a portrait of the man and his legacy, revealing that though his followers have represented Trotsky as a pure revolutionary soul and a powerful intellect unjustly hounded into exile by Stalin and his henchmen. The reality is very different, as this masterful and compelling biography reveals.	2009-11-01	Pan Macmillan						ZZZ000000

9780878932153	The Cell,A Molecular Approach	Geoffrey M. Cooper&Robert E. Hausman		Because molecular and cellular biology is such an exciting and rapidly moving area of science, teaching it at the un-dergraduate level is a rewarding, yet challenging, task. The Cell: a Molecular Approach meets this challenge by providing students with not only the current information, but also with an introduction to the experimental nature of contemporary research. Designed for use in introductory cell biology courses, The Cell presents current, comprehensive science in a readable and cohesive text that students can master in the course of one semester. The new third edition of The Cell retains the organization, themes, and special features of earlier editions, but is updated to reflect scientific advances since publication of the second edition, including progress in genome sequencing, advances in understanding transcriptional regulation and mRNA processing, use of DNA microarrays in global studies of gene expression and cancer diagnostics, advances in nuclear transport and protein trafficking, progress in understanding the regulation of programmed cell death, potential medical applications of embryonic cells, and development of oncogene-targeted treatments. Key Experimental boxes in each chapter describe seminal experiments in modern cell biology, showing the detail and background to give students a sense of doing science. Molecular Medicine boxes relate basic science to clinical practice or potential and show the excitement of molecular discovery and solutions to disease. Chapter summaries are organized in outline form corresponding to the major sections and subsections of each chapter. This section-by-section format is coupled with a list of the key terms introduced in eachsection, providing a succinct but comprehensive review of the material. The full-color art program is both pedagogically and scientifically outstanding.

What this book does tell the reader is about some of the "ins and outs" of Wall Street; about how things really work in the banking world; about some of the speed bumps to watch out for and some of the "low hanging fruit" that is ripe for the picking, from getting in the door and developing positive habits, to getting a bonus and handling retirement. In order to really succeed, it is necessary to know as much as possible about how Wall Street really works. Working the Street goes a long way in providing exactly that.	2004-02-19	Palgrave Macmillan						ZZZ000000

9780792279563	Seeing gardens	Sam Abell		At the heart of every garden lies an idea; the greatest gardens represent not just nature's beauty but the clear vision of a gifted artist. The same is true of an inspired garden book. To capture the essence of a garden demands both a keen eye and a subtle sensibility, the hallmark qualities of Sam Abell's acclaimed photography. Not for nothing is this volume entitled Seeing Gardens, for its landmark images have as much to tell us about how we see as what we see. To Abell, a scatter of pears ripening on a Moscow windowsill evokes an orchard just as surely as his portrait of a 600-year-old Japanese garden summons up an ancient tradition of artfully cultivated wildness. Each pebble, pond and twisted pine in that garden is carefully placed to create an idea of unstudied nature as resonant as reality itself. As befits a book that melds two visual arts, Seeing Gardens lets its 150 pictures speak for themselves with a spare text that offers context rather than commentary. The book is at once thoughtful and elegant, and the anecdotes, recollections and aesthetic philosophy amount to a brief but telling memoir of Abell's three decades of interpreting gardens. His photographs include planned gardens in a variety of cultural settings; found gardens, created by nature but given form by the artist's frame; and the many allusions to gardens in daily life. Whether in the pruned symmetry of a line of plane trees along Lake Como's shores, the pristine shape of a wild water lily in the blackwater mirror of the Okeefenokee Swamp, or the leafy print of a vivid floral fabric, Abell discovers gardens everywhere. The gift of this book is the gift of seeing gardens in a new, intimate and involving way.	2000-11-01	National Geographic						ZZZ000000

9780792275862	Nature's medicine,plants that heal	Joel L. Swerdlow		For thousands of years -- indeed, for all of human history except for the past 50 to 70 years in Western societies -- plants have been our chief source of medicine. The fascinating story that unfolds in the pages of this book is much more than a catalog of natural cures. Equal parts scientific inquiry and cultural history, it's nothing less than a chronicle of the healer's art as it evolved from folk remedies to modern science. It's also an account of humanity's continuing quest to discover new medicines and to unravel the complex and often deeply mysterious interactions between the biochemistry of plants and the human body. From the doctor-philosophers of classical antiquity to the shamans of today's rain forests, healers have prescribed a multitude of cures culled from the flora around them, and in many societies these ancient treatments are still in everyday use. In India, for example, Ayurvedic physicians continue a tradition first codified in written form many centuries before the birth of Christ. The origins of Chinese medicine are similarly shrouded in myth, but its effectiveness has been proved time and time again although the reasons why frequently remain elusive. And in many cases, Western medicine has been too quick to reject as "old wives' tales" the lessons learned and refined over countless generations. In Nature's Medicine you'll learn how a malaria-stricken Spanish countess was cured by the bark of a Peruvian tree, the source of what we now call quinine, and how 18th-century doctors used digitalis for all sorts of ills -- but, ironically, not for heart disease. You'll discover that few natural compounds have been used as the basis for modern pharmaceutical drugs but that many have served as molecular templates for proprietary synthetic formulas. And you'll see how ancient theories based on different views of the human body can lead to surprisingly effective medicines. Featuring some 200 full-color photographs, period illustrations from old medical texts, and watercolors illustrating a catalog of 102 healing herbs, Nature's Medicine is at once a vivid historical chronicle, a valuable compendium of healers' lore, and a revealing excursion into the world of plants whose power to cure has been known for millennia but is only beginning to be understood.	2000-05-01	National Geographic Society						ZZZ000000

9780792265306	Among flowers,a walk in the Himalaya	Jamaica Kincaid		"This account of a walk I took while gathering the seeds of flowering plants in the foothills of the Himalayas has its origins in my love of the gardenmy love of feeling isolated, of imagining myself all alone in the world and everything unfamiliar, or the familiar being strange, my love of being afraid but at the same time not letting my fear stand in the way." So begins Jamaica Kincaid's adventure into the mountains of Nepal with a small group of botanists. After laborious training and preparation, the group leaves Kathmandu by small plane, into the Annapurna Valley to begin their trek. ("From inside the plane it always seemed to me as if we were about to collide with these sharp green peaks, I especially thought this would be true when I saw one of the pilots reading the newspaper, but Dan said that at the other times he'd flown in this part of the world the pilots always read the newspaper and it did not seem to affect the flight in a bad way.") The temperature was 96 degrees F. on arrival, and the little airport in Tumlingtar was awash in Maoists in camouflage fatigues. "What I was about to do, what I had in mind to do, what I planned for over a year to do, was still a mystery to me. I was on the edge of it though." The group sets off with a large retinue of sherpas and bearers, and Kincaid, in simple, richly detailed prose describes the landscape, the Nepalese villages, the passing trekkers and yak herds. Direct and opinionated ("We decided to call them [other trekkers] the Germans because we didn't like them from the look of themand Germans seem to be the one group of people left that cannot be liked because you feel like it."), Kincaid moves easily between closely observed, down-to-earth descriptions of the trek and larger musings, about gardens, nature, seed gathering, home, and family. Negotiations with the Maoists to pass through villages interject dramatic notes ("Dan and I became Canadians. Until then I would never have dreamt of calling myself anything other than American. But the Maoists had told Sunam [head sherpa] that President Powell had just been to Kathmandu and denounced them as terrorists and that had made them very angry with President Powell."). The group presses on, determined in its search for "beautiful plants native to the Himalayas but will grow happily in Vermont or somewhere like that." Eventually they reach a spectacular pass at 15,600 feet and start back. Down at the village of Donge they have another run-in with the Maoists. They "lectured us all through the afternoon into the setting sun, mentioning again the indignity of being called mere terrorists by President Powell of the United States." To lessen the tension, the sherpas produces some Chang, an alcohol made from millet, intoxicating everyone, Kincaid included. At the airport, the Maoists are threatening attack, but the group must wait three days for an airplane. Finally they get off safely. "Days later, in Kathmandu, we heard that the very airport where we had camped for days had been attacked by Maoists and some people had been killed." In Kathmandu another Maoist attack closes the city down. "As we waited to leave this place, I remembered the carpet of gentiansand the isolated but thick patches of Delphinium abloom in the melting snow. There were the forests of rhododendrons, specimens thirty feet highI remembered all that I had seen but I especially remembered all that I had felt. I remembered my fears. I remembered how practically every step was fraught with memories of my past, and the immediate one of my son Harold all alone in Vermont, and my love for it and my fear of losing it."

Some suggested "boobies and beer," but Seaman found that most were much more thoughtful -- so much so that he created a website and now this book to collect the best of them. From thousands of respondents -- including Buddhists, born-again Christians, atheists, waitresses, students, and recovering heart attack patients -- come incredibly diverse wisdom that can be aphoristic ("Be grease, not glue"), philosophical ("There is no point to life, and that is exactly what makes it so special"), or whimsical ("Me, I'm going snowboarding").	2005-08-30	New World Library						ZZZ000000
9780940322080	India,a mosaic	Ian Buruma&Robert B. Silvers&Barbara Epstein		How can we understand India today, fifty years after Independence and only months after its nuclear tests outraged the world? The novelist Arundhati Roy has written, specially for this collection, a fierce denunciation of the Indian nuclear program, which serves as an introduction to nine essays on India, all originally published in The New York Review of Books. In this volume, seven distinguished writers offer penetrating insights into the complexities of the subcontinent. Roderick MacFarquhar reflects on the legacy of Empire and Partition, Ian Buruma considers secularism and Indian democracy, Pankaj Mishra remembers life in Benares, and Christopher de Bellaigue writes on a violent Bombay. But the volatile intersections of history, politics, and culture on which they focus haunt Indian literature too, as shown in essays by Nobel Prize-winner Amartya Sen on Rabindranath Tagore, Hilary Mantel on Rohinton Mistry, and Anita Desai on Indian women's writing. Included is a specially commissioned CD containing a wide range of Indian music.	2000	New York Review Books						ZZZ000000
9780717131938	Conquering Your Fear of Flying	Maeve Byrne-Crangle		Recent figures estimate that one in ten people suffers from a fear of flying. Ironically, this very mode of transport is becoming an everyday means of travel for many, and an essential part of our work and personal lives. Conquering Your Fear of Flying is a positive and ultimately empowering book to help you overcome what is one of the most prevalent fears in today's fast-moving world, and one which often means pure terror for the sufferer. Dr Maeve Byrne Crangle examines and confronts the many types of anxiety involved with flying and lays out a plan to help conquer these apprehensions. She outlines a programme of self-management, showing how to use stress-management techniques to cope and defuse our anxieties before and during flights. Also included are chapters on basic aerodynamics, explanations for the many engine noise changes during the flight, turbulence, and how flight crews are selected and trained for emergencies. Air travel remains statistically safer than crossing the road, and flying has proved to be twenty-five times safer than driving your own car. Conquering Your Fear of Flying is the book to convince even the most faint-hearted flyers of these facts, and to help them towards a happy and fearless future with air travel.

Later still, of course, there'd be no doubt. But for now Driver is, as they say, in the moment. And the moment includes this blood lapping toward him, the pressure of dawn's late light at windows and door, traffic sounds from the interstate nearby, the sound of someone weeping in the next room....' Thus begins Drive, a new novella by James Sallis. Set mostly in Arizona and L.A., the story is, according to Sallis, "...about a guy who does stunt driving for movies by day and drives for criminals at night.

9781904048626	Alchemy and alchemists	Sean Martin		Alchemy has traditionally been viewed as 'the history of an error', an example of medieval gullibility and greed, in which alchemists tried to turn lead into gold, create fabulous wealth and find the elixir of life. But alchemy has also been described as 'the mightiest secret that a man can possess', and it obsessed the likes of Isaac Newton, Robert Boyle and many of the founders of modern science. This book explores the history of the so-called Royal Art, from its mysterious beginnings in Egypt and China, through the Hellenistic world and the early years of Islam and into mediaeval Europe. Some of the greatest minds of the Middle Ages, figures such as Albertus Magnus, Roger Bacon and Thomas Aquinas were drawn to alchemy, and legendary alchemists such as Nicholas Flamel were thought to have actually succeeded in finding The Philosopher's Stone. During the Renaissance, Paracelsus and his followers helped revolutionise medicine, and during the seventeenth century, alchemy played a major role in paving the way for modern science. During the twentieth century, it became a focus of interest for the psychologist Carl Jung and his followers, who believed that the alchemists had discovered the unconscious. In this fully revised edition, Sean Martin has expanded the sections on Chinese and Indian alchemy and has added new material on the relationship between alchemy and early modern science, while also making a fresh assessment of this most enduringly mysterious and fascinating of subjects, to which all others have been described as 'child's play'.	2006	Pocket Essentials						ZZZ000000

Hoping to stay in Germany as long as possible, he writes human interest pieces for British and American newspapers, avoiding the investigative journalism that could get him deported." "But playing it safe turns out to be more difficult than Russell expected. He is approached by an acquaintance from his old communist days who asks him to write some articles for the Soviets. Russell is initially reluctant, but the work seems safe enough at first. At the same time, he becomes involved in more dangerous activities, helping a Jewish family as well as an idealistic young American reporter who is investigating Nazi secrets." "Soon British and Nazi intelligence become aware of Russell's involvement with the Soviets. All three want to use him as he is dragged into the murky world of warning intelligence services."--BOOK JACKET.	2007-04-02	Old Street Publishing						ZZZ000000

9780752879352	Secrets Of The Window's Son	David A. Shugarts&Dan Burstein		SECRETS OF THE WIDOW'S SON is itself an unprecedented book concept. Relying on extensive investigative reporting and intellectual sleuthing, it is an explorer's field guide to understanding the main themes, ideas, symbols and historical issues which author Dan Brown will most likely utilise in THE SOLOMON KEY - months before this much-awaited sequel to THE DA VINCI CODE is even published. SECRETS OF THE CODE told the story of how the riddle embedded in The Da Vinci Code's dust-cover pointed to Dan Brown's next book: selected letters appearing on the book jacket's flaps, slightly bolder than others, spelled out the mystically alluring question, 'Is There No Help for the Widow's Son?' Research led David Shugarts and his team to understand the role of the 'Widow's Son' in the history of Freemasonry, biblical apocrypha, Mormonism, and various secret societies and occult belief systems. Dan Brown has since confirmed that his next book is indeed about the Masons, and that protagonist Robert Langdon, of DA VINCI CODE and ANGELS AND DEMONS fame, would be back to lead us on a symbolic treasure hunt through the art, architecture and secret codes of the American capital, Washington DC. Let's be clear: this book is not designed to be a plot spoiler for THE SOLOMON KEY. It is not trying to guess who will be murdered, or which fictional mysteries, cover-ups, and conspiracies will be invented to drive the plot of this story. SECRETS OF THE WIDOW'S SON is about the ideas and issues that will form the background and context for THE SOLOMON KEY.	2006	Orion Books Limited						OCC036000

9780753820575	Love and Death and Other Near Death Experiences	Mil Millington		Rob Garland is getting married in two months. Oddly, however, this is the least of his problems. More vexing than the seating arrangements, the choice of wedding stationery - more even that the savagely obscene expense of everything - is the fact that Rob should be dead: and he knows it. Faced with an ultimatum from his girlfriend to either sort himself out, or call the wedding (and the whole relationship) off, he sets about trying to come to terms with how it is that, somehow, he's still inexplicably breathing. After pouring his heart out to the listeners on his late-night radio jazz show, he soon finds himself teamed up with others who really ought not to be alive, but who - for random, meaningless and, frankly, stupid reasons - unaccountably are. And that's when things become yet more worrying: because it turns out that their search to understand why they've each remained oddly alive might very well end up killing them all. Love, death, religious beliefs, existential angst - Love and Other Near-Death Experiences is a jack-knifing comedy about those things which should be no laughing matter.	2006-06-01	Orion Publishing Group, Limited						ZZZ000000

Worse yet, it puts her on the dangerous side of the line that can divide good cops from bad.

9780752877808	John Mortimer,the devil's advocate : the unauthorised biography	Graham Lord		John Mortimer was a promising barrister who married a successful novelist (Penelope Mortimer) and then started writing himself. At first he wrote plays, most famously the autobiographical A VOYAGE ROUND MY FATHER, and he is credited with the hugely successful TV adaptation of Evelyn Waugh's Brideshead Revisited. But it was Mortimer's creation of Rumpole of the Bailey, the irascible barrister created on TV by Leo McKern, which catapulted him to wider fame and fortune. Meanwhile he had become increasingly well-known as a lawyer, and he became everyone's first thought when a barrister with liberal principles and left-wing political beliefs was required. John Mortimer's personal life is equally colourful - he divorced his first wife and married a second Penelope, who became known as Penny 2; and recent revelations uncovered that he fathered Wendy Craig's love-child. Graham Lord's biography is all the better for being unauthorised, as he has been able to provide the full, unvarnished story of John Mortimer.	2006-09-21	Orion Books						ZZZ000000

His latest paper 'Effects of Increased Water Acidity on the Caddis Fly Larva' looks set to cause a stir on the pages of Trout & Salmon, his job as a fisheries scientist is satisfactory, and he and his wife, Mary, have just celebrated their twentieth wedding anniversary - for which she gave him a replacement electric toothbrush. So why does he feel as though something is missing?" "When he is asked to become involved in a project to create a salmon river in the highlands of the Yemen, Fred rejects the idea as absurd. But the proposal catches the eye of several senior British politicians, who feel it might distract the media's attention from the less welcome stories coming out of the Middle East. It's not long before the wheels of government start spinning, and the publicity-savvy PM is talking about the project on television. Fred finds himself forced to set aside his research and instead figure out how to fly ten thousand salmon to a desert country ... and persuade them to swim there." "The project is the brainchild of a Yemeni sheikh: a devout and wealthy man, whose love of salmon fishing and whose fervent, unwavering conviction that the impossible can be made possible, eventually, and astonishingly, inspires Fred, overpowering all his rational objections - and infuriating his wife." "When Fred meets Harriet Chetwode-Talbot, the sheikh's elegant and beautiful land agent, the cracks that have begun to form in his carefully managed existence grow even wider, and as they both embark on an extraordinary journey of faith - and fishing - the diffident Dr. Jones will discover a sense of belief, and a capacity for love, and for heroism, that surprises himself, and all who know him."--BOOK JACKET.	2007-03-01	Weidenfeld & Nicolson						ZZZ000000

9780753821671	The Exception	Christian Jungersen		Four women work at the Danish Centre for Genocide Studies. When two of them start receiving death threats, they suspect they are being stalked by Mirko Zigic, a Bosnian torturer and war criminal. But perhaps he is not the person behind the threats - it could be someone in their very midst. Much of the drama created revolves not only around the scary sense of a killer prowling in the shadows but also around the manipulative games being played between the women in the office - theirs is a miniature society complete with hierarchies, laws and traditions, where bullying grows out of old alliances and personal dislikes.The irony is that these betrayals and persecutions are taking place amongst professionals who daily analyse cases of appalling cruelty on a worldwide scale. Now and again, the narrative is broken with extracts from 'articles' dealing with crimes against humanity and the pyschology of evil. Whilst the women apply this to their work with genocide (and the killer), there are parallels to their own behaviour. It's a fabulous pacy read - a real page-turner with depth that resonates with greater questions. One reader said 'This is one of the most intelligently, beautifully constructed novels I have ever read'.	2007-02-01	Orion Publishing Group, Limited						ZZZ000000
9780753821695	The Last Days of Newgate	Andrew Pepper		St Giles, London, 1829: three people have been brutally murdered and the city simmers with anger and political unrest. Pyke, sometime Bow Street Runner, sometime crook, finds himself accidentally embroiled in the murder investigation but quickly realises that he has stumbled into something more sinister and far-reaching.In his pursuit of the murderer, Pyke ruffles the feathers of some powerful people, and, falsely accused of murder himself, he soon faces a death sentence, and the gallows of Old Bailey. Imprisoned, and with only his uncle and the headstrong, aristocratic daughter of his greatest enemy who believe in him, Pyke must engineer his escape, find the real killer and untangle the web of politics that has been spun around him.From the gutters of Seven Dials, to the cells of Newgate prison; from the turmoil of 1800s Belfast to the highest levels of murky, pre-Victorian politics, The Last Days of Newgate is a gripping, darkly atmospheric story with a fantastic, pragmatic - and reluctantly heroic - hero.	2007-02	Orion Publishing Group, Limited						ZZZ000000
9780753821725	Vienna	Eva Menasse&Anthea Bell		From the very beginning - the birth of the narrator's father in the middle of a bridge party - the reader is plunged headlong into the world of Vienna, a novel crowded with voices, characters, tragedy and joy. The disintegration of history and indentity in the twentieth century is seen through the adventures of one family - half-Jewish Viennese, split apart by the Nazi invasion and sent out into the world. Dispensing with linear narrative, the story loops forwards and back to follow each member on their winding course. Their experiences encompass fraudsters, footballers, fools and fur coats as the narrative moves from Austria to London, from Canada to the battlefields of Burma. This is a landmark European novel of impressive reach and power whose readership will spread as widely as the family whose story it tells. It introduces in Eva Menasse an intimate chronicle of human experience and an unashamedly gleeful storyteller. Her cast of entrancing characters and unexpected events shows us imperceptibly the formation and disintegration of family history and identity.	2007-02	Orion Publishing Group, Limited						ZZZ000000

9780753821640	Zoli	Colum McCann		The novel begins in Czechoslovakia in the early 1930s when Zoli, a young Roma girl, is six years old. The fascist Hlinka guards had driven most of her people out onto the frozen lake and forced them to stay there until the spring, when the ice cracked and everyone drowned - Zoli's parents, brothers and sisters. Now she and her grandfather head off in search of a 'company'. Zoli teaches herself to read and write and becomes a singer, a privileged position in a gypsy company as they are viewed as the guardians of gypsy tradition. But Zoli is different because she secretly writes down some of her songs. With the rise of the Nazis, the suppression of the gypsies intensifies. The war ends when Zoli is 16 and with the spread of socialism, the Roma are suddenly regarded as 'citizens' and 'comrades' again. Zoli meets Stephen Swann, a man she will have a passionate affair with, but who will also betray her. He persuades Zoli to publish some of her work - a coup because there has never been a gypsy poet. But when the government try to use Zoli to help them in their plan to 'settle' gypsies, her community turns against her. They condemn her to 'Pollution for Life', which means she is exiled from them forever. She begins a journey that will eventually lead her to Italy and a new life. Zoli is based very loosely on the true story of the Gypsy poet, Papsuza, who was sentenced to a Life of Pollution by her fellow Roma when a Polish intellectual published her poems. But Colum has turned this into so much more - it's a brilliantly written work that brings the culture and the time to life, an incredibly rich story about betrayal and redemption, and storytelling in all its guises.	2007-03-01	Phoenix						FIC000000
9780753821619	The further adventures of a London call girl	Belle De Jour		''She lists like Hornby. She talks dirty like Amis.

Whoever the author is, she should give up the day job. Only then will we find out what the real Belle de Jour is made of.' IndependentThis follow-up to the hugely successful 'Intimate Adventures' will be just as bold, funny and brilliant.

9780753821107	The Night Gardener	George P. Pelecanos		They never found the killer.All they knew, back in the winter of 1985, was that someone was taking teenagers, killing them and leaving their abused bodies in public parks.

9780297853336	Letters from Iwo Jima,the Japanese eyewintess stories that inspired Clint Eastwood's film	Kumiko Kakehashi		Clint Eastwood was so moved by this account of the Japanese defence of Iwo Jima that he ended up making two films in 2006. FLAGS OF OUR FATHERS, based on the bestselling book of the same name, tells the story of the US Marines who raised the flag on the island in what became the iconic photograph of the war with Japan. His other film, LETTERS FROM IWO JIMA is based on Kumiko Kakehashi's heart-rending story, EVEN THE GODS WOULD WEEP. Her account is based on the letters written home by the doomed soldiers on the island, mostly family men, conscripted late in the war. At the heart of the story is the maverick general Kuriyabashi, devoted family man, humanitarian, and brilliant commander and the first man on the island to know they were all going to die. Unlike most Japanese officers, he had travelled widely, spent time in Europe and the USA, and was under no illusions as to the ultimate end. He fought and died to delay the Americans for as long as he could. He knew that once the island fell, it would be used as an airbase by US bombers to strike at Tokyo. EVEN THE GODS WOULD WEEP reveals a very different Japanese army from the popular image of Hollywood movies. It is an incredibly moving portrayal of men determined to resist to the last breathe, despite their profound opposition to the regime that led them into war.	2007-02-08	Weidenfeld & Nicolson						ZZZ000000

Hairdressers have become an extension of our social circle; we talk to them for hours, we tell them things we wouldn't tell our closest friends and when they ask, 'trust me' we invariably do. In this expose on the hairdressing industry we accompany the famous Shorn Locks on his travels around London. From an early blowdry at the palace to the 'bread and butter' appointments throughout the day, the man behind the chair is revealed: the humble beginnings in his mum's hairdressers, how he achieved his dream of a star-studded salon and client list, and how he makes women look and feel their most beautiful every day. It's been an incredible journey for Shorn. Rising from a bullied apprentice to household name hasn't been easy. Dashing from a TV make-over show to a glamorous fashion launch, Shorn's work is photographed, papped and featured on the front of magazines across the world. There are drugs, there are egos, and there are flirtations. But more than anything, there's a lot of plain talking, razor-sharp humour and more hairspray than an up-do in a gale. Shorn's appointment book is always full and the reader is invited along to enjoy, to laugh and to learn hair secrets that only the best can know.	2007-02-28	Orion Books Limited						ZZZ000000

9780753822975	The Dante Trap	Arnaud Delalande		Venice, 1756. One of the city's brightest young actors has been brutally murdered: nailed to a cross in the theatre where he was due to perform, with his eyes put out, and lines of Latin verse carved onto his chest. The Doge, aware the city is full of enemies of the Republic, launches a secret investigation, led by Pietro Viravolta, a dashing young adventurer, and seducer (the best friend of Casanova), who currently awaits execution in the prison beneath the Bridge of Sighs. Viravolta is released, on the proviso that he will neither escape the city, nor pursue the great love of his life, Anna, the married woman whose husband was responsible for Viravolta's incarceration. His investigations lead him to Luciana, the beautiful mistress of a Venetian senator, to Spadetti, the master glass-maker of Murano, and to Caffelli, the tormented priest of San Giorgo Maggiore. Murder follows murder, each more gruesome than the last, and as Viravolta begins to draw the connections between these deaths, and the torments reserved for sinners in each of Dante's circles of hell, he finds himself embroiled in a terrible game of cat and mouse. As the streets of Venice fill with masked Carnival-goers, and as Anna and Viravolta are once again thrown together, he is drawn further into the inferno, to the heart of a secret sect and a plot to bring about the downfall of the city.	2007-06-11	Orion Publishing Group, Limited						ZZZ000000

9780297852308	The age of fallibility,the consequences of the war on terror	George Soros		George Soros made billions anticipating seismic changes in the financial markets and has used that money to try and change the world. In this book he brings that commitment to the subject that has preoccupied him since 2001: the state of America. He looks at the fatal flaws not merely of the current Administration - with whom his antagonism is well documented-but with the wider American view of the world.The "stateless statesman," uninhibited by the need to temper his message to suit partisan politics, here delivers his most forceful and penetrating description of how the country that should provide a beacon for good governance around the world has lost direction - such that it believes its own rhetoric and myth-making, in defiance of the facts that will shape all our futures. Soros insists that "America must undergo a change of heart." And if we're looking for somewhere to start, he says, America had better begin by renouncing the "feel-good" misconceptions implicit in the War on Terror.George Soros is exemplarily clear about the major themes of our time - tyranny, violence, ignorance and arrogance. He is determined to address them and in The Age of Fallibility, he does so with impassioned eloquence.	2006-06-08	Weidenfeld & Nicolson						ZZZ000000

Morgan		One hundred years from now, and against all the odds, Earth has found a new stability; the political order has reached some sort of balance, and the new colony on Mars is growing. But the fraught years of the 21st century have left an uneasy legacy . . . Genetically engineered alpha males, designed to fight the century's wars have no wars to fight and are surplus to requirements. And a man bred and designed to fight is a dangerous man to have around in peacetime. Many of them have left for Mars but now one has come back and killed everyone else on the shuttle he returned in. Only one man, a genengineered ex-soldier himself, can hunt him down and so begins a frenetic man-hunt and a battle survival.

9780753819333	Vanished Landscape,A 1930s Childhood in the Potteries	Paul Johnson		Paul Johnson, the celebrated historian, grew up in Tunstall, one of the six towns around Stoke-on-Trent that made up the Potteries'. From an early age he was fascinated by the strange beauty of its volcanic landscape of fiery furnaces belching out heat and smoke. As a child he often accompanied his father - headmaster of the local art school and desperate to find jobs for his students, for this was the Hungry Thirties - to the individual pottery firms and their coal-fired ovens. His adored mother and father are at the heart of this story and his older sisters who, as much as his parents, brought him up.Children made their own amusements to an extent unimaginable today, and his life was extraordinarily free and unsupervised. No door was locked - Poverty was everywhere but so were the Ten Commandments.' These pages recall the joys of going to school on a minor branch-line - the 1930s were the tail-end of the great age of rail in England - and the eccentricities and ferocity of grown-ups in an age before political correctness. The book ends in 1938 as the 11-year-old author queues at the town-hall for a gas mask.	2005-08-04	PHOENIX						SOC005000

9781587990670	The invisible touch,the four keys to modern marketing	Harry Beckwith		From the author of the marketing classic, Selling the Invisible, comes another indispensable volume for marketers and business people. In The Invisible Touch, Harry Beckwith further explores the world of service-oriented businesses. He reveals how service businesses can attract clients and customers -- and keep them happy and loyal -- by mastering four key concepts and developing "the invisible touch".Service businesses sell something that cannot be seen or heard. Instead, they offer an experience -- and to make that experience truly exceptional, they must first understand the people they are trying to attract and how to satisfy them. Beckwith provides a treasury of quick, practical and entertaining strategies. He applies the study of human nature to the real world of business, focusing on four key concepts crucial to successful marketing: finding the right price (not necessarily the lowest); creating a brand identity; using packaging to enhance the purchasing experience; and putting passion in your relationships with customers.	2001-02	Texere						ZZZ000000

Their plane crashed into a mountain and was stranded 11,000 feet up on an inhospitable glacier. Many died instantly in the crash, including the person sitting next to Nando, but others survived. They had almost no food or suitable equipment to withstand temperatures as low as -35C, and had to eat the bodies of their dead team-mates to survive. With the prospect only of a slow death, and no rescue likely, Nando and one of his friends set off on an impossible journey, walking and climbing for ten days in search of help.

9780805082593	Building Jerusalem,The Rise and Fall of the Victorian City	Tristram Hunt		"Hunt tells this complex, epic story with dazzling clarity and organizational brilliance . . . I know nothing equaling its scope and ambition."Phillip Lopate, Los Angeles Times Ever since Charles Dickens first described Coketown in Hard Times, the nineteenth-century city has connoted deprivation, pollution, and criminality. Yet, as historian Tristram Hunt argues in this powerful new history, the Coketowns born of the Industrial Revolution were canvasas for ambitious urban innovators who would influence the shape of cities for generations. Drawing on diaries, newspapers, and classic works of fiction, Hunt shows how the Victorians translated their energy and imagination into an astonishingly grand architecture, tranforming even the factories of Manchester and Birmingham into sites of freedom and art. Surveying the great civic creations, from town halls to city squares, sidewalks, and even sewers, Hunt reveals a story of middle-class power and the liberating mission of city life. The Victorians vowed to emulate the city-states of Renaissance Italy, and succeededuntil wealthy metropolises degenerated into dangerous inner cities in the twentieth century. Tristram Huntteaches modern British history at the University of London. He writes political and cultural commentary for theLos Angeles TimesandTimemagazine, and has authored numerous radio and television series for the BBC and Channel 4. Since Charles Dickens first described Coketown inHard Times, the Victorian city, born of the industrial revolution, has been a byword for deprivation, pollution, and criminality, depicted to this day as a monstrous landscape of factories, tenements, and disease. Yet, as historian Tristram Hunt argues, the Coketowns of the 1800s were far more than uncontrolled industrial sprawl. By 1851, more than half of Britain's population lived in cities, and even as these urban pioneers confronted an often terrifying new way of life, they produced an incredible flowering that would influence the shape of cities around the world for generations to come. Drawing on private diaries, provincial newspapers, and classic works of fiction, Hunt documents the Victorians' great energy and aspirations and shows how their ambition translated into an astonishingly grand vision of the utopian city on a hillthe new Jerusalem. He surveys the great civic creations, from town halls to city squares, sidewalks, and even sewers, to reveal a story of middle-class power and prosperity and the liberating mission of city life. Vowing to emulate the great city-states of Renaissance Italy with an ethos of civic pride and spurred by municipal rivalry, the Victorians did their best to turn even the smokestacks of Manchester and Birmingham into sites of hard work, freedom, and art. And they succeededuntil the twentieth century, when the loss of civic pride and the collapse of urban confidence transformed wealthy metropolises into dangerous inner cities. A history of proud cities and confident citizens,Building Jerusalemdepicts an unrivalled era that produced one of the great urban civilizations of Western history.

Sergeant brings to bear his trademark wit and keen sense of the absurd but also his deep understanding of the British political arena and an insight born of thirty years' reporting on events in Westminster. His access to those who worked for her, with her and against her is unique, from Michael Heseltine to Norman Tebbit, from John Major to Chris Patten and even Tony Blair.

9780330441636	Prep	Curtis Sittenfeld		Curtis Sittenfeld's debut novel, Prep, is an insightful, achingly funny coming-of-age story as well as a brilliant dissection of class, race, and gender in a hothouse of adolescent angst and ambition. Lee Fiora is an intelligent, observant fourteen-year-old when her father drops her off in front of her dorm at the prestigious Ault School in Massachusetts. She leaves her animated, affectionate family in South Bend, Indiana, at least in part because of the boarding school's glossy brochure, in which boys in sweaters chat in front of old brick buildings, girls in kilts hold lacrosse sticks on pristinely mown athletic fields, and everyone sings hymns in chapel. As Lee soon learns, Ault is a cloistered world of jaded, attractive teenagers who spend summers on Nantucket and speak in their own clever shorthand. Both intimidated and fascinated by her classmates, Lee becomes a shrewd observer of-and, ultimately, a participant in-their rituals and mores. As a scholarship student, she constantly feels like an outsider and is both drawn to and repelled by other loners. By the time she's a senior, Lee has created a hard-won place for herself at Ault. But when her behavior takes a self-destructive and highly public turn, her carefully crafted identity within the community is shattered. Ultimately, Lee's experiences-complicated relationships with teachers; intense friendships with other girls; an all-consuming preoccupation with a classmate who is less than a boyfriend and more than a crush; conflicts with her parents, from whom Lee feels increasingly distant, coalesce into a singular portrait of the painful and thrilling adolescence universal to us all.

We think we live in a time of unprecedented choice. But as Taras Grescoe discovers, this is just an illusion.  In this witty expose our intrepid author goes in search of the things that the rulers of the world will punish you for trying - all the time asking the question: why, in ostensibly free states, should we be criminalized for behaviour that concerns no one but ourselves? In a travelogue that takes in Swiss absinthe, Cuban cigars, Bolivian coca tea and stinking French cheese, Taras Grescoe drinks, smokes and eats his way towards some answers.  Fun, philosophical, and unafraid of the big questions, this is a journey for free-thinkers, not the faint-hearted. As insightful and outraged as " Fast Food Nation" and as funny and astute as "Dude, Where's My Country?," "The Devil's Picnic" is a feast for anyone who has ever made a stand for personal liberty.	2007-02-16	Pan Macmillan						ZZZ000000

9780330445849	The Mighty and the Almighty,Reflections on Faith, God and World Affairs	Madeleine Albright		Does America, as George W. Bush has proclaimed, have a special mission, derived from God, to bring liberty and democracy to the world? How much influence does the Christian right have over U.S. foreign policy? And how should America and the West deal with violent Islamist extremists? Traditionally, politicians have sought to downplay the impact of religious beliefs in international affairs. In this illuminating first-hand account, one of the most renowned figures in American politics argues that understanding the place and power of religion - and knowing how best to respond to it - is essential if America is to lead successfully around the world. Here, Madeleine Albright examines religion and foreign affairs through the lens of American history as well as her own personal experiences in public office, with a preface and opening chapters specially written for the UK edition. She offers a sharp critique of U.S. policy, condemnation for those who exploit religious fervor for violent ends, and praise for political, cultural, and spiritual leaders who seek to harness the values of faith to bring people together. Albright has written a thought-provoking work that calls for bold leadership to rein in the many religious rivalries around the globe and lay the groundwork for a new moral consensus.

As Morse begins his recovery he comes across an account of the investigation and the trial that followed Joanna Franks' death . . . and becomes convinced that the two men hanged for her murder were innocent . . .	2007-03-16	Pan Macmillan						ZZZ000000
9780330451246	The Riddle of the Third Mile	Colin Dexter		The thought suddenly occurred to Morse that this would be a marvellous time to murder a few of the doddery old bachelor dons. No wives to worry about their whereabouts; no landladies to whine about the unpaid rents. In fact nobody would miss most of them at all . . . By the 16th of July the Master of Lonsdale was concerned, but not yet worried. Dr Browne-Smith had passed through the porter's lodge at approximately 8.15 a.m. on the morning of Friday, 11th July. And nobody had heard from him since. Plenty of time to disappear, thought Morse. And plenty of time, too, for someone to commit murder . . .	2007-06-03	Pan Books						ZZZ000000
9780330451284	The Secret of Annexe 3	Colin Dexter		Morse sought to hide his disappointment. So many people in the Haworth Hotel that fateful evening had been wearing some sort of disguise ' a change of dress, a change of make-up, a change of partner, a change of attitude, a change of life almost; and the man who had died had been the most consummate artist of them all . . . Chief Inspector Morse seldom allowed himself to be caught up in New Year celebrations. So the murder inquiry in the festive hotel had a certain appeal. It was a crime worthy of the season. The corpse was still in fancy dress. And hardly a single guest at the Haworth had registered under a genuine name . . .	2007-06-03	Pan						ZZZ000000

Sometimes, this way, he almost managed to forget. But not tonight . . . Anne Scott's address was scribbled on a crumpled note in the pocket of Morse's smartest suit. He turned the corner of Canal Street, Jericho, on the afternoon of Wednesday, 3rd October. He hadn't planned a second visit.

As he put the phone down, Lewis knew that Strange had been right . . . in the case of the Swedish Maiden, the pair of them were in business again . . . They called her the Swedish Maiden ' the beautiful young tourist who disappeared on a hot summer's day somewhere in North Oxford. Twelve months later the case remained unsolved ' pending further developments. On holiday in Lyme Regis, Chief Inspector Morse is startled to read a tantalizing article in The Times about the missing woman. An article which lures him back to Wytham Woods near Oxford . . . and straight into the most extraordinary murder investigation of his career.	2007-08-02	Pan						ZZZ000000

A cryptic 'seventeenth-century' love poem . . . And a photograph of a mystery grey-haired man . . . More than enough to set Chief Inspector E. Morse on the trail of a killer. And it's a trail that leads him to Lonsdale College, where the contest between Julian Storrs and Dr Denis Cornford for the coveted position of Master is hotting up.

In this respect, at least, Lewis was correct in his thinking. What he could not have known was what unprecedented anguish the present case would cause to Morse's soul. Chief Superintendent Strange's opinion was that too little progress had been made since the discovery of a corpse in a North Oxford flat. The victim had been killed by a single stab wound to the stomach. Yet the police had no weapon, no suspect, no motive. Within days of taking over the case Chief Inspector Morse and Sergeant Lewis uncover startling new information about the life and death of Dr Felix McClure. When another body is discovered Morse suddenly finds himself with rather too many suspects. For once, he can see no solution. But then he receives a letter containing a declaration of love . . .	2007-07-02	Pan						FIC022030

For Oxford, the arrival of twenty-seven American tourists is nothing out of the ordinary . . . until one of their number is found dead in Room 310 at the Randolph Hotel. It looks like a sudden ' and tragic ' accident. Only Chief Inspector Morse appears not to overlook the simultaneous theft of a jewel-encrusted antique from the victim's handbag . . .

The murder of Yvonne Harrison had left Thames Valley CID baffled. A year after the dreadful crime they are still no nearer to making an arrest. But one man has yet to tackle the case ' and it is just the sort of puzzle at which Chief Inspector Morse excels. So why is he adamant that he will not lead the re-investigation, despite the entreaties of Chief Superintendent Strange and dark hints of some new evidence? And why, if he refuses to take on the case officially, does he seem to be carrying out his own private enquiries?

9780230016293	Connected: 24 hours in the global economy	Daniel Altman		Oil prices go up, the stock market goes down. Currency exchange rates fluctuate, the Chinese economy is booming, and new technologies are changing the way we do business. What if you could look behind the headlines of the global economy, to see how it really works? Instead of listening to pundits, politicians, and protestors, you could see first-hand how everyone from migrant workers to central bank governors live their lives.  Now you can. Having chosen June 15, 2005, as the focal point for his book, Altman contacted dozens of people from all corners of the world and all levels of the economy, from factory workers and currency traders to CEOs and entrepreneurs, asking them for first-person narratives of their activities on that one day. Starting with their stories and keying his chapters to the headlines of the day, Altman takes on pressing questions in new ways: Can poor countries become rich too quickly? Can corruption ever be a good thing? Do companies need crises in order to stay competitive? What determines the global economic pecking order? Along the way, you'll find quick guides to the fundamental markets that link the global economy together: stocks, credit, currencies, and oil.  Most importantly, you'll learn how the billions of decisions taken by individuals can and do change the future. This book is part travel guide, part owner's manual - an essential road map for every citizen of the global economy in the 21st century.	2007	Macmillan						ZZZ000000
9781405053457	Comrades,a world history of communism	Robert Service		Comrades tells the story of communism from its inception to the present day. It offers a succession of incisive pen-portraits of outstanding leaders and decisive events, and spans the nineteenth and twenty-first centuries. Comrades ranges across not only the high politics and ideology of the most prominent communist regimes but also daily life under communism, culture, and propaganda. Service ends by showing that there was more to communism than mere brutality and demonstrates the causes of its ability to gather support among intellectuals and ordinary people (economic poverty and political oppression) have not vanished. The lasting message of the book is that something must be done to eradicate poverty and oppression if the world is to avoid a repetition of totalitarianism in some new form.	2007	Macmillan						ZZZ000000

Though previously well adjusted and known as an extrovert, Acland now withdraws into himself. As he begins his recovery in a dismal provincial hospital, crippled by migraines and suspicious of his doctors, he grows uncharacteristically aggressive--particularly against women, and most particularly against his ex-fiancee. Finally, rejecting medical advice to undergo cosmetic surgery--opting, instead, to accept his disfigurement--and cutting all ties to his former life, he moves to London. There, alone and unmonitored, he sinks into a quagmire of guilt and paranoia--until an outburst of irrational, vicious anger brings him to the attention of the local police: they are investigating three recent murders, all of them apparently motivated by the kind of extreme rage that Acland has exhibited. Now under suspicion, Acland is forced to confront the issues behind his desperate existence before it's too late: Has he always been the duplicitous chameleon that his ex-fiancee accuses him of being? Can he control this newly apparent sinister side of his personality? And why, if he truly hates women, does he in the end seek help from a woman--someone as straightforward and self-disciplined as he is unsure and seemingly out of control--to repair the damage to his mind? In its timeliness, its psychological complexity, and its unstoppable suspense, "The Chameleon's Shadow" is a thriller of the firstorder.	2007-10-15	Macmillan						ZZZ000000

Corey Grace, a handsome and charismatic Republican senator from Ohio, is plunged by an act of terrorism into a fierce presidential primary battle with the favourite of the party establishment and a magnetic leader of the Christian right.

9780330443357	Inquisition The Reign Of Fear	Toby Green		Everybody has heard of the Inquisition. This was an institution that pursued heretics, philandering priests, and sexual deviants in Europe, Africa, Asia, and Latin America for a period of over 350 years, changing its focus with the times and enduring stubbornly into the nineteenth century. Today the word implies dread, fear, and a withheld threat of torture. But who were its targets? Why did it provoke such fear? How and where did it operate? Why was it founded, and why did it last for so long? Toby Greens incredible new book brings an extraordinary 350 year period vividly to life by focusing on the hitherto untold stories of individuals from all walks of life and every section of society. Because the Inquisition touched every aspect of society, it changed the world: people attending church had to look suitably devout, or they might be denounced; a curse at a game of cards, thrown out in the heat of the moment, could bring an investigation; stripping fat from a leg of lamb was enough to excite accusations of being a Jew. With a secret police and a thought police, the Inquisition produced a permanent state of fear. This history, though filled with stories of terror and the unspeakable ways in which human beings can treat one another, is also one of hope and ultimately of the resilience of the human spirit. Instead of being cowed by their fear, countless people rebelled in small and big ways, paving the way for a more inclusive society. The story of the Inquisition is not, then, one to be hidden and avoided; it deserves to be told in all its human richness and complexity.	2008-02-08	Pan Books						ZZZ000000

9780330445993	My Lady Judge	Cora Harrison		In the sixteenth century, as it is now, the Burren, on the western seaboard of Ireland, was a land of grey stone forts, fields of rich green grass, and swirling mountain terraces. It was also home to an independent kingdom that lived peacefully by the ancient Brehon laws of their forebears. On the first eve of May, 1509, hundreds of people from the Burren climbed the gouged out limestone terraces of Mullaghmore Mountain to celebrate the great May Day festival, lighting a bonfire and singing and dancing through the night, then returning through the grey dawn to the safety of their homes. But one man did not come back down the steeply spiralling path. His body lay exposed to the ravens and wolves on the bare, lonely mountain for two nights...and no one spoke of him, or told what they had seen. And when Mara, a woman appointed by King Turlough Don OBrien to be judge and lawgiver to the stony kingdom, came to investigate, she was met with a wall of silence.	2008-05-09	Pan						ZZZ000000
9780330448567	W. Axl Rose,The Unauthorized Biography	Mick Wall		Axl Rose is one of rock's most colourful figures and yet his story has never been properly told until now. Mick Wall knew the original line-up of Guns N' Roses before they were famous and has interviewed them many times. Drawing on exclusive unpublished material he has written a no-holds-barred study of the turbulent life and career of the group's singer and leader.  Wall describes Axl's difficult childhood in Indiana and how, after escaping to LA, he and his fledgling band struggled to survive until they signed up by Geffen in 1986. The first album, "Appetite for Destruction," turned them into stars but the band's lurid lifestyle took its toll - they embarked on a two-year tour that sounded the death knell for the original line-up. As their lives slipped out of control, the original members bar Axl all left. Axl himself turned into an increasingly reclusive figure, working on the long-awaited "Chinese Democracy" album. In 2006 he re-emerged into public view as Guns N' Roses embarked on a world tour.  Scrupulously researched and vividly written, "W. Axl Rose" is an explosive biography of one of rock's biggest living legends.	2008-05-02	Pan Macmillan						ZZZ000000

9780230014725	Foxbat	James Barrington		Back in 1976, a Russian front-line pilot defected to Japan in a MiG-25 Foxbat interceptor, flying virtually at sea level to avoid pursuing fighters and surface-to-air missiles. With about thirty seconds of fuel remaining, he landed at Hakodate Airport, bursting a tyre and skidding off the runway. Before the aircraft was handed back to the Russians, American intelligence agencies reduced it to a pile of components and then rebuilt it. Despite the wealth of intelligence gleaned, they completely failed to realise the purpose for which the Foxbat was created.  Moving to the present, American satellites have detected unusual activity at several Algerian air bases, and at Ain Oussera one large hangar has been cordoned off and armed guards posted outside. Western intelligence agencies suspect that Algeria might be working-up its forces prior to launching an attack on Libya or Morocco, with potentially destabilising effects in the region. They're also concerned that they might have obtained new aircraft or weapon systems, perhaps secreted in the guarded hangar at Ain Oussera. The only way to find out is to get someone to look inside the building, and it will have to be a covert insertion.  This is where Paul Richter is called in, as 'a deniable asset', in an exciting non-stop thriller that moves rapidly through Bulgaria, Russia, and ultimately North Korea.	2008-09-08	Pan Books						ZZZ000000

But stranded outside the system, her nightmare day job was interviewing Paris Hilton, Britney Spears and Co. Jane was trapped in the Golden Age of Stupid.

But in cruel twist, when Jane arrived in Uganda John had left. Alone in a war-torn country, appalled by 25,000 child abductions, Jane knew she must investigate the war crime of the century - to make John fancy her.

9780330446488	Dead-End Road	Richard Kunzmann		Detective Harry Mason has rejoined the South African Police Service after a two-year leave of absence, and moved over to the specialised Serious and Violent Crimes unit, headed by the tough and fiery veteran commander Superintendent Carl 'Blackie' Swarts. Soon afterwards, Harry is assigned to investigate the slaying of a minor politician and his family, in a township west of Johannesburg. The case, at first seemingly unsolvable, is abruptly saved by an enigmatic grassroots anarchist whom Harry befriended during the apartheid riots of the '80s, and soon the SVC is hot on the heels of one of the country's most secretive and violent vigilante groups, known as 'The Guardians', headed up by two brothers whose brutality is legendary amongst the poor inhabitants of Johannesburg's squatter camps.  As the investigation slices away at the layers of secrecy surrounding this group, other secrets surface - truths that ultimately pose a threat to Harry's unit, and to the city at large. When Harry is abruptly gunned down by unseen assassins during a dawn raid on a remote village, and a bomb is detonated in the judicial heartland of Johannesburg, his former police partner and long-time friend, Detective Jacob Tshabalala, is forced to take matters into his own hands, and expose a splinter faction of vigilantes operating within the police service itself - a faction whose connections stretch all the way into parliament itself.	2008-12-05	Pan						ZZZ000000

But however bad things look they can always get worse, as Ethelred discovers when his ex-wife, Geraldine, vanishes close to his Sussex home. When the disappearance becomes a murder enquiry, the police quickly decide that Geraldine Tressider has been the victim of a local serial killer. Elsie begs to differ, on the grounds that the killer's other victims had been Sad Cows, whereas Geraldine was a Scheming Bitch - another species entirely - and no serious serial killer would murder one in mistake for the other . . .  Soon the indefatigable Elsie has bullied Ethelred into embarking upon his own investigation, but as their enquiries proceed, she begins to suspect that her client's own alibi is not as solid as he claims.

9780330441544	Line War	Neal Asher		The Polity is under attack from a 'melded' AI entity with control of the lethal Jain technology, yet the attack seems to have no coherence. When one of Erebus's wormships kills millions on the world of Klurhammon, a high-tech agricultural world of no real tactical significance, agent Ian Cormac is sent to investigate, though he is secretly struggling to control a new ability no human being should possess . . . and beginning to question the motives of his AI masters. Further attacks and seemingly indiscriminate slaughter ensue, but only serve to bring some of the most dangerous individuals in the Polity into the war. Mr Crane, the indefatigable brass killing machine sets out for vengeance, while Orlandine, a vastly-augmented haiman who herself controls Jain technology, seeks a weapon of appalling power and finds allies from an ancient war. Meanwhile Mika, scientist and Dragon expert, is again kidnapped by that unfathomable alien entity and dragged into the heart of things: to wake the makers of Jain technology from their five-million-year slumber. But Erebus's attacks are not so indiscriminate, after all, and could very well herald the end of the Polity itself . . .	2009-05-01	Tor						ZZZ000000

9780330444880	The Fame Formula,How Hollywood's Fixers, Fakers and Star Makers Created the Celebrity Industry	Mark Borkowski		The "Fame Formula" is a highly entertaining study of the creators of the publicity industry, taking us from vaudeville and the movies to the age of television and the internet. Starting with Maynard Nottage and Harry Reichenbach, who applied their anarchic talents to dreaming up stunts at the turn of the twentieth century, Borkowski goes on to describe how, in the hands of Hollywood fixers Eddie Mannix and Howard Strickling, publicity agents Russell Birdwell, Warren Cowan, Henry Rogers and more, this freewheeling industry developed. These men hatched ostrich eggs to promote movies and hatched incredible stories to dress up the lives of stars, buried scandals and buried their lives in their work. And in so doing they laid the foundation of a billion dollar manipulation industry and the modern world's rampant celebrity culture.  Borkowski also reveals how his research has led to the creation of a fame formula, an analysis of how long any celebrity can expect to stay famous - and how to avoid relegation to the Z list.

9780330507240	Making an elephant,writing from within	Graham Swift		As a novelist Graham Swift delights in the possibilities of the human voice, imagining his way into the minds and hearts of an extraordinary range of characters. In Making an Elephant the voice is his own. As generous in its scope as it is acute in its observations, this highly personal book is a singular and open-spirited account of a writer's life.  Swift brings together a richly varied selection of essays, portraits, poetry and interviews, full of insights into his passions and motivations, and wise about the friends, family and other writers who have mattered to him over the years. Kazuo Ishiguro advises on how to choose a guitar, Salman Rushdie arrives for Christmas under guard, and Ted Hughes shares the secrets of a Devon river. There are private moments, too, with long-dead writers, as well as musings on history and memory that readers of Swift's novels will recognize and love.  A journey through place and time, "Making an Elephant" is a book of encounters, between a son and his father, between an author and his younger selves, between writer and reader, and between friends. It brims with charm and candour, and tells of alertness to experience and a true engagement with words, in short, with what it means to feel that writing and reading are an essential part of living.	2009	Picador						ZZZ000000
9781405090377	God of Clocks	Alan Campbell		War, rebellion, betrayal -- but the worst is still to come. For in the cataclysm of the battle of the gods, a portal to Hell has been opened, releasing unnatural creatures that were never meant to be and threatening to turn the world into a killing field. And in the middle, caught between warring gods and fallen angels, humanity finds itself pushed to the brink of extinction. Its only hope is the most unlikely of heroes.  Former assassin Rachel Hael has rejoined the blood-magician Mina Greene and her devious little dog Basilis on one last desperate mission to save the world from the grip of Hell. Carried in the jaw of a debased angel, they rush to the final defensive stronghold of the god of clocks - pursued all the while by the twelve arconites, the great iron-and-bone automatons controlled by King Menoa, the Lord of the Maze. Meanwhile, in the other direction, the giant John Anchor, still harnessed to his master's skyship, drags that vessel into Hell itself to meet Menoa on his own ground.  But neither Heaven nor Hell is anything they could ever expect. Now old enemies and new allies join a battle whose outcome could be the end of them all. Rachel's ally, the god Hasp, finds himself in the grip of a parasite and struggles against conflicting orders to destroy his own friends; and a dangerous infant deity comprised of countless broken souls threatens to overcome them all. As Rachel travels to the final confrontation she has both sought and feared, she begins to realise that time itself is unravelling. And so she must prepare herself for a sacrifice that may claim her heart, her life, and her soul -- and even then it may not be enough.	2009-07-03	Tor Books						FIC009000

Sent out on a titanic Polity dreadnought, the Occam Razor, agent Cormac must investigate the disaster. Meanwhile, on the remote planet Masada, the long-term rebellion can never rise above-ground, as the slave population is subjugated by orbital laser arrays controlled by the Theocracy in their cylinder worlds, and by the fact that they cannot safely leave their labour compounds. For the wilderness of Masada lacks breathable air ... and out there roam monstrous predators called hooders and siluroynes, not to mention the weird and terrible gabbleducks.	2009-10-02	Tor						ZZZ000000
9780230749559	Katherine the Queen,The Remarkable Life of Katherine Parr	Linda Porter		The general perception of Katherine Parr, the sixth and last wife of Henry VIII, is that she was a provincial nobody with intellectual pretensions who became queen of England because the king needed a matronly consort to nurse him as his health declined. In the various studies of the six wives of Henry VIII she receives much less attention than Katherine of Aragon or Anne Boleyn. Her main achievement, in the famous rhyme about Henry's six wives, is that she survived. Yet the real Katherine Parr was attractive, passionate (she had a mighty temper when aroused) ambitious and highly intelligent. She was 30 years old (younger than Anne Boleyn had been) when she married the king. Twice widowed, held hostage by the northern rebels during the great uprising of 1536-37 known as the Pilgrimage of Grace, her life had been dramatic even before she became queen. It would remain so after Henry's death, when she hastily and secretly married her old flame, the rakish Sir Thomas Seymour. Katherine died shortly after giving birth to her only child in September 1548, her brief happiness undermined by the very public flirtation of her husband and step-daughter, Princess Elizabeth. Despite the vivid interest of her life, this is the first full-scale, accessible biography of this fascinating woman who was, in reality, one of the most influential and active queen consorts in English history.	2010	Pan Macmillan						ZZZ000000
9780375424533	The long chalkboard and other stories	Jenny Allen&Jules Feiffer		Here are three delightful, bittersweet, especially-for-our-time adult stories of modern life as lived by men and women of a certain age: the baby boomer. Jenny Allen's brilliant and witty narratives and Jules Feiffer's playfully expressive drawings coax to the surface the hidden anxieties, familiar frustrations, and downright fury that we try to convince ourselves we don't really feel. The characters in these stories are reckoning with life's little surprises. But what they don't expect sometimes turns out to be all right anyway: a little redemption bubbling up in the kitchen where "Judy's Wonder Chili" is made. . . or hiding in the folds of an origami crane, waiting to be found by the children's book writer in "Something Happened". . . or revealing itself on the surface of the well-used chalkboard of the title tale. In their humor, simplicity, and subtlety, these stories--brought to life perfectly through Feiffer's drawings--speak to our deepest adult-yet-childlike selves. There's not a grown-up among us who won't be completely charmed.	2006-10-10	Pantheon Books						ZZZ000000

9781862057005	Lady Cottington's pressed fairy book	Terry Jones&Brian Froud		Everyone is familiar with the famous photograph of the small girl surrounded by fairies, which caused such a sensation when it was first published in The Regular magazine in 1907. That little girl was Angelica Cottington. On the death of her father, Lady Cottington lived as a recluse on the family estate until she died in 1991. Three years after her death, a series of unfortunate, and fortunate, accidents brought about the discovery of the very book in which she preserved her pressed fairies. Published in facsimile, the book became one of the most truly intriguing, faithful and epoch-making books of all time. It was an overnight success. Meanwhile, a very sad event occurred. Brian Froud, without permission, surreptitiously removed the original book and a reel of documentary film which purported to show the Lady Cottington in her garden, with the dog, demonstrating how to squash fairies. Froud immediately spotted the fakery: the dog was manipulated by strings! Preparing to return the film he noticed that the book's pages had begun to develop in the daylight and ooze with mould. Incredibly, with the passage of time each page had begun to throw up impressions of so many more unceremoniously flattened fairies, attacked by Lady C in old age - actually the truth being that the old dear had mostly missed and thus the pages reveal bits of fairy and the odd old one. Froud, disgusted, guilty, and not a little frightened, posted the book back immediately. The Cottington archivist opened the parcel and rushed, breathlessly, to the publisher once more. This extraordinary 10 3/4th anniversary publication is the result. DVD to include previously unreleased material from the Cottington Archive: a Pressed Fairy art gallery, interviews with Brian, Terry and Ari Berk and 5 minute filmed interview with Lady Cottington. DVD to be produced by Imaginosis.

9780143029410	My little boat	Mariam Karim		Often we lead a life that is not our own. People tell us, then we tell ourselves, that this is the only reality. But somewhere inside us we know that it lies elsewhere&in another dimension. Nasreen does not belong in Rahimganj, a small town by the river Gomti in UP. And she no longer knows where she does. She has no culture, no language that she can claim as her own. Her mother, Saira Alvi, a famous poet and feminist, when she gave Nasreen in marriage to the town's most prominent family, had hoped to spare her daughter the loneliness of a rebel life; but the shift only deprived Nasreen of the few certainties she had. For years now she has lived in the past in the Paris and London of her childhood, and memories of her dead mother and her long-lost friend Zamurrad. She fills her journal with fragments of her puzzled part-life , and often wanders down to the river, sometimes forgetting to return. People know her as the odd, perhaps insane wife of Javed, proprietor and editor of the local newspaper Tabsira, himself fighting a losing battle for love in his home, and for reason in post-Pokharan, post-Babri Masjid India. But Nasreen s life will soon intersect with that of the town she has never completely understood: when an attempted murder in the local church brings Rahimganj to the brink of communal conflict, the private and the public collide, and tragedy unfolds. In graceful, vivid prose, Mariam Karim writes about the loneliness of those without a place they can truly call home, and eloquently examines complex issues of identity: the relevance of an individual life in society, the power of history and faith, the burden of memory and love.	2003	Penguin						ZZZ000000

9780143335764	Tall tales	David Jaspar Utley		Riveting yarns of adventure and romance told with gentle wit - Great-grandpa claims to be over a hundred years old, and no one is about to contradict him. He is a South Indian gentleman of immense character, though he might not look it. All that distinguishes him are his enormous hennaed moustache, which he is very proud of, and his walking stick, which he makes every attempt to hide. Dressed in his trademark white dhoti and cotton shirt, he sits in his battered white cane chair in the garden all day, and drinks cup after cup of hot, sweet, milky tea. And tells his great-grandson the most incredible stories. There isn t a thing great-grandpa hasn t done in his younger years, it appears. He has captured a tiger single-handed, won a classical music contest as a rank outsider, run a detective agency, come face to face with a ghost in Fort St. George, been captured by the French for spying in Pondicherry, had his brush with fame as a film actor, beaten the viceroy s team in an impromptu cricket match, and even encountered the world s last surviving unicorn in Mohenjodaro. All this would seem extremely unlikely, if it were not for the verve with which great-grandpa tells the stories, and the detail he embellishes them with. One doesn t quite know whether to believe him, but it s great fun listening to him anyway. And one can t really put the heroic deeds past him. After all, hasn t he recently hypnotized a combative crocodile at the zoo by dancing in front of it and making it go cross-eyed?	2003-01-01	Puffin Books						ZZZ000000

9780143032564	Mangal Pandey,brave martyr or accidental hero?	Rudrangshu Mukherjee		Come out! Get ready! It s for our religion! From biting these cartridges we shall become infidels! On a sleepy Sunday afternoon in March 1857, an agitated sepoy in the English East India Company s 34th Native Infantry marched on to the parade ground in Barrackpore, exhorting his comrades to join him in protecting their religion from the Europeans. When British officers arrived to arrest him, he drew his sword on them and then turned his musket on himself. As he was led off to the gallows a few days later, Mangal Pandey passed into history and legend as the man who single-handedly started the 1857 Rising. But who was the real Mangal Pandey? A dashing, heroic figure, as portrayed by Aamir Khan in the film The Rising? A fiery patriot who embarked on a suicidal mission to defend his country s honour? Or just an ordinary sepoy who, in a state of intoxication, committed a foolhardy act for which he was hanged? Lively, thought-provoking as well as scholarly, Rudrangshu Mukherjee s analysis of this emotive episode in Indian history presents a vivid picture of life in the barracks of the East India Company s cantonments in 1857, describes the social customs and military regulations that governed the daily routines of Mangal Pandey and other Indian sepoys, and examines the controversies and unrest that foreshadowed the 1857 Rising. Uncovering the hard facts behind the myths and conjectures of popular belief, nationalist rhetoric and cinematic imagination, this book provides, for the first time, a credible portrait of Mangal Pandey as he really was.	2005	Penguin Books						ZZZ000000

While certainly not the first account of a female body being negotiated for honor in a family, this time the survivor had bravely chosen to fight back. In doing so, Mai single-handedly changed the feminist movement in Pakistan, one of the world's most adverse climates for women.  By July 2002, the Pakistani government awarded her the equivalent of 8,500 U.S. dollars in compensation money and sentenced her attackers to death -- and Mukhtar Mai went on to open a school for girls so that future generations would not suffer, as she had, from illiteracy.  In this rousing account, Mai describes her experience and how she has since become an agent for change and a beacon of hope for oppressed women around the world. Timely and topical, "In the Name of Honor" is the remarkable and inspirational memoir of a woman who fought and triumphed against exceptional odds.	2007-02	Virago						ZZZ000000

9780670019076	Bad money,reckless finance, failed politics, and the global crisis of American capitalism	Kevin Phillips		The bestselling author reveals how the U.S. financial sector has hijacked our economy and put Americas global future at risk In American Theocracy, Kevin Phillips warned us of the perilous interaction of debt, financial recklessness, and the increasing cost of scarce oil. The current housing and mortgage debacle is proof once more of Phillipss prescience, and only the first harbinger of a national crisis. In Bad Money, Phillips describes the consequences of our misguided economic policies, our mounting debt, our collapsing housing market, our threatened oil, and the end of American domination of world markets. Americas current challenges (and failures) run striking parallels to the decline of previous leading world economic powersespecially the Dutch and British. Global overreach, worn-out politics, excessive debt, and exhausted energy regimes are all chilling signals that the United States is crumbling as the world superpower. Bad money refers to a new phenomenon in wayward megafinancethe emergence of a U.S. economy that is globally dependent and dominated by hubris-driven financial services. Also bad are the risk miscalculations and strategic abuses of new multitrillion-dollar products such as asset-backed securities and the lure of buccaneering vehicles like hedge funds. Finally, the U.S. dollar has been turned into bad money as it has weakened and become vulnerable to the worlds other currencies. In all these ways, bad finance has failed the American people and pointed U.S. capitalism toward a global crisis. Bad Money is the perfect follow- up to Phillipss last book, whose dire warnings are now proving frighteningly accurate.	2008-11-01	Viking						ZZZ000000

9780747591788	Imperial life in the Emerald City,inside Baghdad's green zone	Rajiv Chandrasekaran		From a walled-off enclave of towering plants, smart villas and sparkling swimming pools - a surreal bubble of pure Americana known as the Green Zone - the US-led Coalition Provisional Authority, under imperial viceroy L. Paul Bremer III, attempted to rule Iraq in the first twelve months after the fall of Saddam Hussein's regime. Drawing on hundreds of interviews and internal documents, Rajiv Chandrasekaran tells the memorable story of this ill-prepared attempt to build American democracy in a war-torn Middle Eastern country, detailing not only the risky disbanding of the Iraqi army and the ludicrous attempt to train the new police force, but also bringing to light a host of lesser-known yet typical travesties, among them: * the aide who based Baghdad's new traffic laws on those of the state of Maryland, downloaded from the net * the contractor with no previous experience paid millions to guard a closed airport * the people with prior experience in the Middle East who were excluded in favour of lesser-qualified Republican Party loyalists * the case of the 24-year-old who had never worked in finance put in charge of revitalising Baghdad's stock exchange Written with wit and urgency by a sharp-eyed observer, Imperial Life in the Emerald City provides a hair-raising portrait of the gap between the Oz-like Green Zone and the brutal reality of post-war Iraq. It is American reportage at its best.	2007-02-05	Bloomsbury						ZZZ000000

Teach Yourself to Think is software for the brain, turning it into a successful thinking mechanism, and, as such, will prove of immense value to us all.	1996-11-01	Penguin						ZZZ000000

9780140258394	Simplicity	Edward De Bono		Have you ever given up trying to programme your video recorder or use a feature on your computer because the instructions are so complicated? Or wondered why it is so difficult to fill in a tax form? Modern life can be unnecessarily frustrating. Needless systems, processes, legislation and red tape only serve to increase our anxiety. Here Edward de Bono, the originator of lateral thinking, shows us how we can bring a little simplicity into our complex lives. The challenge of achieving simplicity requires a lot of creative techniques, including historical review, which asks whether something we traditionally take for granted is still necessary; shedding, where we eliminate what cannot be justified; bulk and exceptions, which deals separately with majority and extreme cases; and reframing, which can make us realise we are seeking solutions to a non-problem. Edward de Bono concludes his thought-provoking study with ten key rules for simplicity, and ground-breaking plans for an Institute of Simplicity and National Simplicity Campaign.	1999-08-01	Penguin						ZZZ000000

9780140432053	The origin of species by means of natural selection, or, The preservation of favoured races in the struggle for life	Charles Darwin&John Wyon Burrow		Perhaps the most readable and accessible of the great works of scientific imagination, The Origin of Species sold out on the day it was published in 1859. Theologians quickly labeled Charles Darwin the most dangerous man in England, and, as the Saturday Review noted, the uproar over the book quickly "passed beyond the bounds of the study and lecture-room into the drawing-room and the public street." Yet, after reading it, Darwin's friend and colleague T. H. Huxley had a different reaction: "How extremely stupid not to have thought of that."Based largely on Darwin's experience as a naturalist while on a five-year voyage aboard H.M.S. Beagle, The Origin of Species set forth a theory of evolution and natural selection that challenged contemporary beliefs about divine providence and the immutability of species. A landmark con-tribution to philosophical and scientific thought, this edition also includes an introductory historical sketch and a glossary Darwin later added to the original text.Charles Darwin grew up considered, by his own account,  "a very ordinary boy, rather below the common standard of intellect." A quirk of fate kept him from the career his father had deemed appro-priate--that of a country parson--when a botanist recommended Darwin for an appointment as a naturalist aboard H.M.S. Beagle from 1831 to 1836. Darwin is also the author of the five-volume work Zoology of the Voyage of the Beagle (1839) and The Descent of Man (1871).	1985	Penguin Classics						ZZZ000000

Here, he describes the glory and decadence of the mad Emperor Caligula's reign - an age of wild debauchery and whimsical cruelty.	2005-05-31	Penguin						ZZZ000000

Because if it doesn't, very soon it will have no customers at all. In All Marketers Are Liars Seth Godin uses dozens of examples to show us that the most successful stories aren't necessarily the most truthful but are usually the most compelling and plausible. That means they are believed by those who tell them. Which means they are believed by those who listen to them. and that means they get passed on . . . and on.

9780316854399	The way of the women	Marlene Van Niekerk		In this rare personal investigation, His Holiness the Dalai Lama discusses his vision of science and faith working hand in hand to alleviate human suffering. Drawing on a lifetime of scientific study and religious practice, he explores the great debates and makes astonishing connections between seemingly disparate topics - such as evolution and karma - that will change the way we look at the world.While he sees science and faith as 'complementary but different investigative approaches with the same goal of seeking the truth,' the fact is that the two have often been at the root of human conflict for centuries. The Dalai Lama challenges us to see that the benefits of opening our hearts and minds to the connections between science and faith are far preferable to perpetuating the divisive rhetoric that often surrounds them.Now, as we face such troubled and uncertain times, the need has never been greater for this extraordinary man's compassion and wisdom.	2007-12-25	Little, Brown						ZZZ000000

9780316861663	Old World, New World,the story of Britain and America	Kathleen Burk		Our close bond with Great Britain seems inevitable, given our shared language and heritage. But as distinguished historian Kathleen Burk shows in this groundbreaking history, the close international relationship was forged only recently, preceded by several centuries of hostility and conflict that began soon after the first English colony was established on the newly discovered continent. Burk, a fourth-generation Californian and a professor of history in London, draws on her unrivaled knowledge of both countries to explore the totality of the relationship--the politics, economics, culture, and society--that both connected the two peoples and drove them apart. She tells the story from each side, beginning with the English exploration of the New World and taking us up to the present alliance in Iraq. She reveals the real motivations for settling North America, the factors that led to Britain's losing the colonies, and the reasons why hawks in Congress took the two countries to war again in 1812. Indeed, war between Britain and the United States loomed again later in the nineteenth century, and it took common enemies to bring them together in the twentieth. But the anchor of the alliance was human. Nineteenth-century British writers celebrated American energy while scorning its vulgarity; American writers appreciated the British sense of tradition while criticizing its aristocracy. Yet social reformers on both sides of the ocean worked together to end slavery and achieve female suffrage. Since 1945, the world has watched and wondered at the close bonds of the leaders--Kennedy and Macmillan, Reagan and Thatcher, and Bush and Blair. The first joint history of its kind, Old World, New Worldis a vivid, absorbing, and surprising story of one of the longest international love-hate relationships in modern history.	2007	Little, Brown						ZZZ000000

9781846141591	The Bin Ladens,The Story of a Family and Its Fortune	Steve Coll		The rise and rise of the Bin Laden family is one of the world's great stories of the 20th century: the repercussions of that rise have, of course, already deeply marked the 21 st century.nbsp; And yet it is a story that has never been properly told.nbsp; Their affairs shrouded in secrecy, living in one of the most powerful, closed and unaccountable countries on earth, the Bin Ladens have-until now-successfully fended off all attempts to understand the world from which Osama sprang.nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Steve Collrsquo;s The Bin Ladens is the history of a family and its fortune: of how a one-eyed illiterate, Mohammed Bin Laden, from a harsh region of Yemen, went as a young man to the new, oil-rich country of Saudi Arabia and with remarkable speed became a vital figure in its development, building great mosques and highways and making himself and his many children into millionaires.nbsp; It is the story of the Saudi royal family, who the Bin Ladens served so loyally, and without whose capricious favour they would have been nothing.nbsp; And it is the story of the revolutions in a modern Islam awash with oil money: of a country founded on extreme religious purity becoming mired in the temptations of the West.nbsp; In only two generations the men and women of the Bin Laden family moved from a desert canyon in Yemen to luxury jets, yachts and private compounds around the world.nbsp; The religious and cultural pressures could not have been greater.nbsp; This resulted in everything from enthusiasm for the West, exemplified by Osamarsquo;s brother Salem , a free-living pilot and adventurer, to an overwhelming determination to destroy it. nbsp; The Bin Ladens-meticulously researched, brilliantly written-is one of the major works to be provoked by the current crisis.nbsp; Colourful, shocking, entertaining and disturbing, it dramatizes all the strange contradictions of globalization in the story of a single family who have used money, mobility and technology to frighteningly varied ends.	2008-04-03	Allen Lane						ZZZ000000

In the meantime, Adrian continues to be scandalized by his irresponsible mother and father, who are conducting a matrimonial square-dance with the Braithwaites - parents of the beautiful by unobtainable Pandora, who is ruthlessly pursuing her ambition to be New Labour's first woman PM - and to confide in his diary. His current worries include: indestructible head-lice; his raging jealousy when his accomplished half-brother Brett arrives on his doorstep; moral decline in The Archers; his desperate attachment to two therapists; his mild addiction to Starburst (formerly Opal Fruits); a small earthquake in Leicester; and, perhaps most significantly, the dawn of a new millennium.	2008-11-11	Michael Joseph						ZZZ000000

9781846142277	The Vanishing Face of Gaia,A Final Warning	James Lovelock		Why would a ninety year old man choose to defy his most trusted physician? Because in an act of splendid generosity Sir Richard Branson offered him the chance to fly into space, to share that transcendental feeling known only to astronauts - that our home is the Earth itself, not the house or the street or the nation where we live - which for a scientist who has spent a lifetime studying the way our planet works was irresistible. As climate change develops and poses new problems James Lovelock will offer a view of our and the Earth's possible future in light of this trip differing from that of most scientists and the science of the IPCC. We are trying already to undo some of the harm we have done and will try harder, even desperately, but until we see that the Earth is more than a mere ball of rock we are unlikely to remedy the cause of the change. The root problem is that there are too many people, pets and livestock for the Earth to carry. The Face of Gaia will tell us why it matters that we see and feel the earth as a living organism. The cost of our neglect of Gaia could soon cause the greatest human tragedy in living memory, because the Earth, in its but not our interests, is now moving into a new hot epoch, one where it can more easily continue to keep the planet habitable. If we are to have any chance to avoiding global catastrophe his words should be heeded.	2009	Allen Lane						ZZZ000000

9781594200038	Origins of the crash,the great bubble and its undoing	Roger Lowenstein		This inquiry into the rise and fall of the great Wall Street boom of the 1990s, from bestselling author Roger Lowenstein, has all the hallmarks of a financial classic. Roger Lowenstein, recognized as one of the best financial reporters of our time, turns his focus to the 1990s stock market and economic boom and bust in Origins of the Crash. With his singular gift for turning complex financial events into eminently readable stories, Lowenstein lays bare the labyrinthine events of the manic 1990s-including the collapse of Enron, the dot-com bubble, the accounting scandal at Andersen, and much more. Drawing on his sense of history, Lowenstein inquires how a financial system that arose out of the wreckage of the Depression and that was intended to avert the miscues of that era could ultimately repeat the very same scenario of massive speculation and corruption leading to collapse. He discovers the roots of the recent crisis in the financial culture that cropped up in the 1970s and 1980s as America encouraged companies to hand out ever greater packages of stock options to their executives. In an enthralling narrative, Lowenstein ties together all of the characters of the great boom and bust: Alan Greenspan, Jack Grubman, Jack Welch, Abby Cohen, Henry Blodget, and a host of dot-com pioneers. But it is the collective rendering of such figures-the unique portrayal of the culture of the era-that truly distinguishes Origins of the Crashas the book that will frame our appreciation of the period. Just as John Kenneth Galbraith's The Great Crashwas the canonical text of 1929, Lowenstein's Origins of the Crashis destined to become the definitive account of the 1990s.	2004	Penguin						ZZZ000000
9781591840886	The search,how Google and its rivals rewrote the rules of business and transformed our culture	John Battelle		What does the world want? According to John Battelle, a company that answers that question -- in all its shades of meaning -- can unlock the most intractable riddles of both business and culture. And for the past few years, that's exactly what Google has been doing.Jumping into the game long after Yahoo, Alta Vista, Excite, Lycos, and other pioneers, Google offered a radical new approach to search, redefined the idea of viral marketing, survived the dotcom crash, and pulled off the largest and most talked about initial public offering in the history of Silicon Valley.But The Searchoffers much more than the inside story of Google's triumph. It's also a big-picture book about the past, present, and future of search technology, and the enormous impact it is starting to have on marketing, media, pop culture, dating, job hunting, international law, civil liberties, and just about every other sphere of human interest.More than any of its rivals, Google has become the gateway to instant knowledge. Hundreds of millions of people use it to satisfy their wants, needs, fears, and obsessions, creating an enormous artifact that Battelle calls "the Database of Intentions." Somewhere in Google's archives, for instance, you can find the agonized research of a gay man with AIDS, the silent plotting of a would-be bombmaker, and the anxiety of a woman checking out her blind date. Combined with the databases of thousands of other search-driven businesses, large and small, it all adds up to a goldmine of information that powerful organizations (including the government) will want to get their hands on.No one is better qualified to explain this entire phenomenon than Battelle, who cofounded Wiredand founded The Industry Standard. Perhaps more than any other journalist, he has devoted his career to finding the holy grail of technology -- something as transformational as the Macintosh was in the mid- 1980s. And he has finally found it in search.Battelle draws on more than 350 interviews with major players from Silicon Valley to Seattle to Wall Street, including Google cofounders Larry Page and Sergey Brin and CEO Eric Schmidt, as well as competitors like Louis Monier, who invented AltaVista, and Neil Moncrief, a soft-spoken Georgian whose business Google built, destroyed, and built again.Battelle lucidly reveals how search technology actually works, explores the amazing power of targeted advertising, and reports on the frenzy of the Google IPO, when the company tried to rewrite the rules of Wall Street and declared "don't be evil" as its corporate motto.For anyone who wants to understand how Google really succeeded -- and the implications of a world in which every click can be preserved forever -- THE SEARCH is an eye-opening and indispensable read."Battelle has written a brilliant business book, but he's also done something more... All searchers should read it." -Walter Isaacson, CEO of the Aspen Institute"This book ought to be called 'The Answer.' As usual, John Battelle delivers insightful, thought-provoking, and essential reading." -Seth Godin, author of All Marketers Are Liarsand Purple Cow"Nobody, and I mean nobody, has thought longer, harder, or smarter about Google and the search business than John Battelle." -John Heilemann, author of Pride Before the Fall"A must read for anyone endeavoring to understand one of the most important trends of this generation.'" -Mary Meeker, Managing Director, Internet Analyst, Morgan Stanley"Battelle has... figured out why "search" is so damned important to the future of everything digital. Even more impressive, he's actually managed to turn the subject into a compelling analog story. -John Huey, editorial director, Time inc."A terrific book." --L.

9780747581680	The Indian Clerk	David Leavitt		On a January morning in 1913, G. H. Hardy - eccentric, charismatic and, at thirty-seven, already considered the greatest British mathematician of his age - receives a mysterious envelope covered with Indian stamps. Inside he finds a rambling letter from a self-professed mathematical genius who claims to be on the brink of solving the most important unsolved mathematical problem of his time. Some of his Cambridge colleagues dismiss the letter as a hoax, but Hardy becomes convinced that the Indian clerk who has written it - Srinivasa Ramanujan - deserves to be taken seriously. Aided by his collaborator, Littlewood, and a young don named Neville who is about to depart for Madras with his wife, Alice, he determines to learn more about the mysterious Ramanujan and, if possible, persuade him to come to Cambridge. It is a decision that will profoundly affect not only his own life, and that of his friends, but the entire history of mathematics. Based on the remarkable true story of the strange and ultimately tragic relationship between an esteemed British mathematician and an unknown - and unschooled - mathematical genius, and populated with such luminaries as D. H. Lawrence, Bertrand Russell, and Ludwig Wittgenstein,The Indian Clerkfashions from this fascinating period an exquisitely nuanced and utterly compelling story about the fragility of human connection and our need to find order in the world.	2008-03-01	Bloomsbury						ZZZ000000

9780465070473	The cigarette century,the rise, fall, and deadly persistence of the product that defined America	Allan M. Brandt		The invention of mass marketing led to cigarettes being emblazoned in advertising and film, deeply tied to modern notions of glamour and sex appeal. It is hard to find a photo of Humphrey Bogart or Lauren Bacall without a cigarette. No product has been so heavily promoted or has become so deeply entrenched in American consciousness.And no product has received such sustained scientific scrutiny. The development of new medical knowledge demonstrating the dire harms of smoking ultimately shaped the evolution of evidence-based medicine. In response, the tobacco industry engineered a campaign of scientific disinformation seeking to delay, disrupt, and suppress these studies. Using a massive archive of previously secret documents, historian Allan Brandt shows how the industry pioneered these campaigns, particularly using special interest lobbying and largesse to elude regulation.But even as the cultural dominance of the cigarette has waned and consumption has fallen dramatically in the U.S., Big Tobacco remains securely positioned to expand into new global markets. The implications for the future are vast: 100 million people died of smoking-related diseases in the 20th century; in the next 100 years, we expect 1 billion deaths worldwide.	2007	Basic Books						ZZZ000000

9781586484668	The new Asian hemisphere,the irresistible shift of global power to the East	Kishore Mahbubani		For centuries, the Asians (Chinese, Indians, Muslims, and others) have been bystanders in world history. Now they are ready to become co-drivers. Asians have finally understood, absorbed, and implemented Western best practices in many areas: from free-market economics to modern science and technology, from meritocracy to rule of law. They have also become innovative in their own way, creating new patterns of cooperation not seen in the West. Will the West resist the rise of Asia? The good news is that Asia wants to replicate, not dominate, the West. For a happy outcome to emerge, the West must gracefully give up its domination of global institutions, from the IMF to the World Bank, from the G7 to the UN Security Council. History teaches that tensions and conflicts are more likely when new powers emerge. This, too, may happen. But they can be avoided if the world accepts the key principles for a new global partnership spelled out in The New Asian Hemisphere.	2008	PublicAffairs						ZZZ000000

9781560256847	Lint	Steve Aylett		Steve Aylett has always gone a step farther than his contemporaries. In Slaughtermatic, he pushed the limits of science fiction, and for that he was named a finalist for the Philip K. Dick Award. Now, in Lint, he offers the first-ever biography of one of the great minds of our time: Jeff Lint, author of some of the strangest and most inventive satirical SF of the late twentieth century. Lint transcended genre in classics such as Jelly Result and The Stupid Conversation, becoming a cult figure and pariah. Like his contemporary Philip K. Dick, he was "blithely ahead of his time." Aylett follows Lint through his Beat days, his immersion in pulp SF, psychedelia, and resentment, his disastrous scripts for Star Trek and Patton, and his belated Hollywood success in the 1990s. It was a career haunted by death, including the undetected death of his agent; the controversial death of his rival, Herzog; and the unshakable "Lint is dead" rumors, which persisted even after his death. This hilarious mock biography is outrageous and remarkably funny, Aylett is an Evelyn Waugh for our time.	2005-05-23	Thunder's Mouth Press						ZZZ000000

9781933112060	Come fly with us!,a global history of the airline hostess	Johanna Omelia&Michael Waldock		When the first commercial flights took off in the 1930s, stewardesses were registered nurses whose duties included swatting flies and helping passengers read railroad timetables in the event of forced landings. In the 1950s, stewardesses were viewed as wives-in-training, as adept at preparing a baby's bottle as mixing a martini. By the swinging '60s and '70s, female flight attendants were considered successful marketing tools, sporting microminis, hot pants, and buttons that read "Pure, Sober, and Available" to lure male business passengers on board. "Come Fly with Us! explores the unique history of this industry pioneered by women, tracing changes in the flight attendant's role -- from flying nurse to airborne sex kitten to today's custodian of safety and service. Stunning visuals from airline archives and early flight maps, promotional brochures, and print advertisements re-create a sense of the early days and underscore the dramatic changes that have occurred in this dynamic industry.	2006-05-28	Collectors Press						ZZZ000000

9780786718160	How the cold war began,the Igor Gouzenko affair and the hunt for Soviet spies	Amy W. Knight		On September 5, 1945, cipher clerk Igor Gouzenko severed ties with the Soviet Embassy in Ottawa, reporting to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police allegations of extensive Soviet espionage in North America, providing stolen documents detailing Soviet intelligence matters to back his claims. This action sent shockwaves through Washington, London, Moscow, and Ottawa, changing the course of the twentieth century. Using recently declassified FBI and Canadian RCMP files on the Gouzenko case, author and Cold War scholar Amy Knight sheds new light on the FBI's efforts to incriminate Alger Hiss and Harry Dexter White in order to discredit the Truman Administration. FBI chief J. Edgar Hoover seized upon Gouzenko's defection as a means through which to demonize the Soviets, distorting statements made by Gouzenko to stir up "spy fever" in the U.S., setting the McCarthy era into motion. Through the FBI files and interviews with several key players, Knight delves into Gouzenko's reasons for defecting and brilliantly connects these events to the strained relations between the Soviet Union and the West, marking the beginning of the Cold War.	2006	Carroll & Graf						ZZZ000000

9781933231006	50 Years with Car and Driver	Marty Padgett		"50 Years with Car and Driver commemorates the golden anniversary of the most popular car magazine on the planet. But more than that, 50 Years with Car and Driver tells the story of the American automobile and how the editors of the magazine witnessed that history and reported on it, firsthand. A look at how Car and Driver evolved from its beginnings as Sports Cars Illustrated, in the able hands of great automotive journalists such as Ken Purdy and John Christy, and then came into it own as the musclecar era of the Sixties dawned. Writers such as David E. Davis, Jr., Brock Yates and Patrick Bedard helped to craft a literary car magazine that drew as much inspiration from Tom Wolfe's writing as it did from the great cars of the day." "Through the Seventies the magazine's reputation solidified as the technical authority on new cars, and the literary tradition continued with such writers as Don Sherman and author P.J. O'Rourke." "Throughout the Eighties, the magazine prospered even when its writers went off the deep end - literally, getting stranded in Mexico during a Baja comparison test. Car and Driver watched over the virtual rebirth of the American car during that decade, with the renaissance at Ford through the Taurus and the revival of the Corvette, while keeping its lock on the strongest feature writing in the auto magazines with stories like Brock Yates's thirty-years-past observance of the death of James Dean." "The Nineties saw Car and Driver continue its leadership as the world's largest-selling automotive magazine. From the introduction of the Acura NSX and the Mazda Miata to the brand-new Mustangs and Corvettes that have come in just the past years, Car and Driver has been the authority that readers trust when it comes to 0-60 times, road tests and reviews." "Fifty Years with Car and Driver combines classic stories from the magazine, commentary by former staffers including the author, vintage and modern photos of the hottest and most important cars reviewed by the magazines, as well as stories from behind the scenes - with all the attitude, expertise and visual excitement readers have come to expect from the magazine itself."--BOOK JACKET.	2005-10-01	Filipacchi Publishing						ZZZ000000
9780871139474	Sherlock Holmes,the unauthorized biography	Nick Rennison		He has been called a genius and a fraud, a hero and an addict. He advised kings in their glittering palaces, then disappeared into the darkest alleys of London's criminal underworld. He was (and remains) a global icon, but he could pass his most ardent fan on the street without a flicker of recognition. Who was this Sherlock Holmes? Nick Rennison gathers the clues of a life lived among the stars of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, from Oscar Wilde to Sigmund Freud, and uncovers startling, previously unknown information. How did a Cambridge drop-out and bit player on the London stage transform himself into a renowned "consulting detective"? Did he know the identity of Jack the Ripper? To where did Sherlock Holmes disappear after his presumed death in 1891? Sherlock Holmes answers these questions and many more as it careens through the most infamous crimes and historic events of the era, all in pursuit of the real man behind the greatest detective in modern fiction--and, just perhaps, nonfiction.	2006-11	Atlantic Monthly Press						ZZZ000000

9781560259862	Outside the Gates of Science,Why It's Time for the Paranormal to Come in from the Cold	Damien Broderick		The paranormal--phenomena "beyond the normal," manifested by apparent experiences of telepathy, remote viewing, psycho kinesis, and precognition, or the prediction of future events--has been comfortably dismissed as fiction by many reasonable folk. But as 21st-century science explores the world of quantum mechanics--where one particle can be in many places at the same time--what has seemed impossible becomes just another part of our strange universe. Award-winning author Damien Broderick, PhD, investigates possible relationships between parapsychology, evolutionary biology, and quantum (and other) physics. Here is a serious but popular treatment of paranormal claims and current attempts to explain them. Broderick has been in direct contact with many of the major players in this curious realm, including the scientific director of the long-classified US government-supported study known under various codenames and, as Star Gate, closed in 1995 by the CIA. But the research continues, now privately funded. Can we predict the future? Read other minds? Outside the Gates of Science suggests we just might be able to do so . . .	2007-05-30	Thunder's Mouth Press						ZZZ000000

9781560252108	John Lennon: Whatever Gets You Through the Night,The Stories Behind Every John Lennon Song 1970-1980	Paul Du Noyer		As John Lennon said to Playboy in 1980, "I like to write about me, because I know about me." John Lennon: Whatever Gets You Through the Night is a song-by-song analysis of every song Lennon wrote and recorded after the Beatles breakup in 1970 until his death in 1980. In his songs he explored the traumas of his childhood, the bitter legacy of the Beatles, his love for Yoko, his infidelities, and his insecurity. There are also the classic anthems of social protest, like "Give Peace a Chance" and "Power to the People." Even his choice of covers like "Stand by Me" and "Be-Bop-A-Lula" tells much about his musical roots. Finally there are Lennon's accounts of his domestic contentment and optimism for the future.	1999-07	Thunder's Mouth Press						ZZZ000000
9781599290096	Invasion! Earth Vs. the Aliens	Robert Reginald		In this sweeping saga set on Earth and intergalactic space, Robert Reginald envisions a detailed future world of Martians versus humans. In the first novel, "War of Two Worlds," they attack without warning or mercy, slaughtering and harvesting humankind. An intrepid band of ordinary people refuse to accept what seems inevitable, vowing to fight to the death. The second novel, "Operation: Crimson Storm," spreads the conflict to space as Earth goes on the offensive. Deep within the bowels of their own Red Planet, the aliens use many different weapons, not all of them military, to fight the human foes. In the final book, "The Martians Strike Back!," war rages deeper into the solar system, with savage battles fought on land and sea. The planetoid Ceres holds the key -- but will both races die before they can unlock it? Reginald's gripping prose and rich narrative make these books worthy successors to Wells' cosmic vision.	2007-09-28	Underwood Books						ZZZ000000

9780753812884	Intoxicating minds	Ciaran Regan		Whether schizophrenia, depression or anxiety, drugs are commonly prescribed by psychiatrists to repair the fragmented mind - in essence serving to improve people's contribution to society. And from the social use of caffeine and alcohol, through the despair of heroin addiction, to the transcendental properties of LSD, drugs continue to play a pivotal role in shaping our culture. In this book, Ciaran Regan explores the links between drugs, brains and society through our new understanding of how the brain works. He argues that mechanisms of brain development are replayed as we store new information and that these are significantly influenced by exposure to drugs. As these storage mechanisms are known to be defective in conditions such as schizophrenia and depression and to be altered by exposure to drugs, his ideas provide a unique interface between pharmacology and brain function.	2001-12-06	Phoenix						ZZZ000000
9780753813768	How the universe got its spots,diary of a finite time in a finite space	Janna Levin		Conventional wisdom says the universe is infinite. But could it be finite, merely giving the illusion of infinity? Modern science is beginning to drag this abstract issue into the realm of the real, the tangible and the observable. HOW THE UNIVERSE GOT ITS SPOTS looks at how science is coming up sharp against the mind-boggling idea that the universe may be finite. Through a decade of observation and thought-experiment, we have started to chart out the universe in which we live, just as we have mapped the oceans and continents of our planet. Through a kind of cosmic archaeology and without leaving Earth, we can look at the pattern of hot spots left over from the big bang and begin to trace the 'shape of space'. Beautifully written in a colloquial style by a world authority, Janna Levin explores our aspirations to observe our universe and contemplate our deep connection with it.	2003-01-02	Phoenix						ZZZ000000

9780753818602	The bubble of American supremacy,correcting the misuse of American power	George Soros		George Bush's foreign policy is going to be one of, if not the key issue that will win or lose him the White House in November 2004. Already Senator Kerry - the Democratic front runner - has highlighted the danger of America being isolated from the rest of the world as it wields its military might. In this passionate and compelling critique, 'the world's only private citizen with a foreign policy', George Soros, combines his razor-sharp sense of political and economic trends with his forthright advocacy for decency in international relations to come up with a workable, and severely critical, analysis of the Bush administration's overreaching, militaristic foreign policy. Soros believes that the Bush administration's plans abroad come from the same sort of 'bubble' psychology that afflicted US markets in the late 1990s. They have used a real fact, American's overwhelming military supremacy, to create a deluded worldview in which 'might makes right' and 'you're either with us or against us'.	2004-10-07	Phoenix						ZZZ000000
9780753818657	Rounding the Horn,A Story of Discovery and Adventure	Dallas Murphy		With the heart of a sailor and the narrative skill of a novelist, Dallas Murphy explores the enduring allure of the mythic Cape Horn. Located at the southernmost tip of the Andes, Cape Horn is a place where the storms are bigger, the winds stronger, the geography more dangerous for a seafarer thananywhere else in the world.From when it was named in 1616 until the present day, Cape Horn has had a rich history filled not only with the horrors of sailing disasters but also with the pleasures of Darwinian research into flora and fauna.The author uses his own voyage around Cape Horn to weave together the history of explorations, along with tales of Indians who lived there, the oceanography and meteorology of the region (with echoes of The Perfect Storm), the science of navigation and the natural history of the area. The result is the story of a sailor testing his own limits as well as a truly captivating depiction of one of the most fascinating areas on earth.	2005-04-07	Phoenix						ZZZ000000

9780753820629	The city,a global history	Joel Kotkin		Cities are mankind's greatest creation. They represent the most eloquent expression of our species' ingenuity, beliefs and ideals. From Babylon and Rome to London, New York and Tokyo, Joel Kotkin examines the evolution of urban life over the millennia in order to establish what made - and makes - a city great. Despite their infinite variety, all cities essentially serve three purposes: spiritual, political and economic. Kotkin follows the progression of the city from the early religious centres of Mesopotamia, the Indus Valley and China, to the imperial centres of the Classical era, through the rise of the Islamic city and the European commercial capitals, ending with today's post-industrial suburban metropolis'. Today's cities face many problems, and they can only thrive if they remain sacred, safe and busy. This is as true for the developing world, where at least 600 million people now live in squatter cities' , as it is for the great global cities which face the challenges of shifting demographics, new technologies and the threat of terrorism.	2006-09-06	Phoenix						ZZZ000000
9780753820674	The Secret Life of E. Robert Pendleton	Michael Collins		It's been over a decade since Robert Pendleton published his brilliant short story debut, and his hopes for a dazzling literary career now lie in tatters. Hanging on to his tenure in literature at Bannockburn college by the slimmest of threads, Pendleton's simmering despair boils over with the arrival on campus of his one-time friend, now nemesis, the bestselling author and king of the coffee-table book, David Horowitz. For Pendleton, death seems to be the only remaining option, but his attempt to kill himself is wrecked by the intervention of Adi Wiltshire, a graduate student battling her own demons of failure and thwarted ambition. Whilst Pendleton recovers from his suicide attempt, Adi discovers a novel hidden in his basement: a brilliant, bitter story with a gruesome murder at its core. The publication of Scream causes a storm of publicity, a whirlwind into which Adi and Horowitz are thrust - along with the sister of a young girl whose real-life, unsolved murder bears an uncanny resemblance to the crime in Pendleton's novel and a burnt-out cop with secrets of his own, who is determined to prove that in this case fact and fiction are one and the same.	2006-10-01	Orion Publishing Group, Limited						FIC022000

9780753821930	Man in the Shadows	Efraim Halevy		From Operation Desert Storm to the beginning of US incursions into Iraq, Efraim Halevy was Deputy Director and then Director of Israel's Mossad, arguably the most developed and, sometimes, ruthless intelligence service in the world. MAN IN THE SHADOWS is Halevy's memoir of that period from his vantage point inside the Mossad, as well as a look at what lies ahead for a world transformed by Islamic terrorism. Having served as the secret envoy to Prime Ministers Rabin, Shamir, Netanyahu, Barak and Sharon, Halevy was privy to, and collector of, some of the most sensitive information coming out of the region. Beginning with a prologue that describes a visit he made to Jordan in 1993, Halevy looks back to Desert Storm, an event he calls 'an epic of unfinished business' and brings the reader up to the present day through 9/11 and the WMD crisis in Iraq. Informed by his extraordinary access from the beginning of his Mossad career in 1961, he writes frankly of the Israeli PMs he worked under as well as most of the other major players in the region and around the world: Yasir Arafat, Saddam Hussein, Hafez Assad, Hosni Mubaraq, Crown Prince Abdullah, Mu'amar Qadaffi, Presidents Clinton and Bush, as well as former CIA director George Tenet and counter-intelligence chief James Angleton. Though Halevy looks to the past, he also looks to the future and talks bluntly about how the world might achieve peace in the region and elsewhere. Much of what he has to say will surprise and shock even those readers well versed in the complexities of the region.	2007-04-30	Phoenix						ZZZ000000
9780753821985	The Explorer's Eye	Fergus Fleming		In the 18th century, exploration entered a new dimension - explorers were motivated by scientific inquiry rather than greed. To this end they were expected to make a full record of everything they encountered; and for the first time in history, that record was to include pictures as well as words. Combining gripping first-hand accounts with original images, THE EXPLORER'S EYE gives an insight into who these people were and what they saw. They were a mixed bunch but, whatever their training or background, they provided a vivid portrait of the unknown. In the early days they drew their own pictures, later they were equipped with draughtsmen, later still they carried cameras, and ultimately they were accompanied by film crews. The power of their images is matched by that of their journals. Here you have Alexander von Humboldt braving the electric eels of South America, Robert Peary explaining his relationships with Eskimos, Jacques Cousteau examining the planet from under the waves and Neil Armstrong doing the same from outer space.	2007	Phoenix						ZZZ000000
9780753821411	The Day the Whale Came	Lynne Cox		The real-life story of how the world's most famous female long-distance swimmer encountered a grey whale separated from its mother - and how she helped to reunite them. Lynne Cox is the author of Swimming to Antarctica, a memoir of her life as a swimmer. From the age of fourteen she has been breaking records for long-distance swimming, culminating in a mile-long swim in Antarctica, in zero degree water. When Lynne was 17, and on a training swim off the California mainland, she found herself swimming with a grey whale that had lost its mother. For the next seven hours, she swam with the whale - through pods of dolphin, and schools of sun-fish, between the pilings of a pier, and out to the base of an oil-rig, diving down as deeply as Lynne was able to, losing sight of the whale for minutes only to have it return and listen to its strange clicking and singing - in an increasingly desperate attempt to locate its mother.	2007-09-19	Phoenix						ZZZ000000

9780753822043	Collected stories	Cynthia Ozick		It is the stories upon which Cynthia Ozick's literary reputation rests. She writes about bitterness, cruelty and compulsion with brutal acuity and tenderness. She has created a timeless collection in which Greek mythology, superstition and the religious and cultural experience of the Jewish diaspora in America collide. The Pagan Rabbi is seduced by a tree sprite after seeing his daughter rescued from drowning by a water sprite. Such ecstasy is not permitted to mortals and so the scholar must die. He hangs himself with his prayer shawl as he watches the strangely beautiful nymph decay. In Envy, a Yiddish poet who watches the success of a contemporary, becomes very like a character in an I.B. Singer story entrapped by his anguish and haunted by the memory of a child. In the Doctor's Wife, the most gentle of the stories, a poor doctor not unlike Chekhov endures family life in which he is adored by his three sisters and oppressed by his family obligations. In these stories, we see Ozick defining herself and her literary territory. The stories may be read purely as evocations of Jewish experience, where time seems to have by-passed these characters. In the Butterfly and the Traffic Light, Jerusalem is seen upon a hill as only it can be in legend, and America is said not to have cities scarred by battles. This is a dazzling collection of short stories by an internationally celebrated novelist.	2007	Phoenix						ZZZ000000
9780330281720	Running in the family	Michael Ondaatje		In Michael Ondaatje's beloved family memoir, fact and fiction blur to create a dazzlingly original portrait of a lost time and place. Ondaatje left Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) at the age of eleven. Almost twenty-five years later, he returned to sort out the recollected fragments of experience, legend, and family scandal, and to reconstruct the carefree, doomed life his parents and grandparents had led in a place where couples danced the tango in the moonlight, where drink, gambling, and romance were the main occupations of the upper class. Rich with eccentric characters and captivating stories, and set against the exotic landscape of a colonial empire in decline, "Running in the Family" is Ondaatje's unforgettable journey through memory and imagination to reclaim his past.	1984	Picador						ZZZ000000

9780330306430	Child of God	Cormac McCarthy		By the author of the critically acclaimed Border Trilogy, "Child of God" is a taut, chilling novel that plumbs the depths of human degradation. Lester Ballard, a violent, solitary and introverted young backwoodsman dispossessed on his ancestral land, is released from jail and allowed to haunt the hill country of East Tennessee, preying on the population with his strange lusts. McCarthy transforms commonplace brushes with humanity - in homesteads, stores and in the woods - into stunning scenes of the comic and the grotesque, and as the story hurtles toward its unforgettable conclusion, depicts the most sordid aspects of life with dignity, humour, and characteristic lyrical brilliance.  'Demands its reader's attention from the opening sentence' " Newsweek"  'A reading experience so impressive, so 'new', so clearly well made that it seems almost to defy the easy aesthetic categories . . . Accomplished in rare, spare, precise yet poetic prose' "New Republic "  'His prose, unfailingly beautiful and exact, carries us into a dreamworld of astonishing and violent revelation. It is a frightening, entrancing world, which we must finally recognize as our own' Tobias Wolff  'McCarthy is a powerful and talented writer, able to elicit compassion for his protagonist however terrible his action' "Sunday Times "	1989	Picador						ZZZ000000
9780330313810	Metroland	Julian Barnes		Only the author of Flaubert's Parrot could give us a novel that is at once a note-perfect rendition of the angsts and attitudes of English adolescence, a giddy comedy of sexual awakening in the 1960s, and a portrait of the accommodations that some of us call "growing up" and others "selling out."

Jack is head of Hitler studies at the College-on-the-Hill. His colleague Murray runs a seminar on car crashes. Together they ponder the instances of celebrity death, from Elvis to Marilyn to Hitler. Through the brilliant and often very funny dialogue between Jack and Murray, Delillo exposes our common obsession with mortality and delineates Jack and Babette's touching relationship and their biggest fear - who will die first?	1999	Picador						ZZZ000000
9780330288491	Ragtime	E. L. Doctorow		Published in 1975, Ragtime changed our very concept of what a novel could be. An extraordinary tapestry, Ragtime captures the spirit of America in the era between the turn of the century and the First World War. The story opens in 1906 in New Rochelle, New York, at the home of an affluent American family. One lazy Sunday afternoon, the famous escape artist Harry Houdini swerves his car into a telephone pole outside their house. And almost magically, the line between fantasy and historical fact, between real and imaginary characters, disap-pears. Henry Ford, Emma Goldman, J. P. Morgan, Evelyn Nesbit, Sig- mund Freud, and Emiliano Zapata slip in and out of the tale, crossing paths with Doctorow's imagined family and other fictional characters, including an immigrant peddler and a ragtime musician from Harlem whose insistence on a point of justice drives him to revolutionary violence.The Modern Library has played a significant role in American cultural life for the better part of a century. The series was founded in 1917 by the publishers Boni and Liveright and eight years later acquired by Bennett Cerf and Donald Klopfer. It provided the foundation for their next publishing venture, Random House. The Modern Library has been a staple of the American book trade, providing readers with afford-able hardbound editions of impor-tant works of literature and thought. For the Modern Library's seventy-fifth anniversary, Random House redesigned the series, restoringas its emblem the running torch-bearer created by Lucian Bernhard in 1925 and refurbishing jackets, bindings, and type, as well as inau-gurating a new program of selecting titles.The Modern Library continues to provide the world's best books, at the best prices.

9780330280303	A traveller's life	Eric Newby		Eric Newby's life of travel began with strange adventures in prams, forays into the lush jungles of Harrods with his mother and into the perilous slums of darkest Hammersmith on his way to school. Such beginnings aroused his curiosity about more outlandish places, a wanderlust satisfied equally by travels through the London sewers, by bicycle to Italy and through wildest New York. His book chronicles the whole range of situations into which he has thrown himself with characteristic verve and optimism, and his perception of the incongruous is as sharp when travelling abroad in search of high fashion, as buyer to a chain of department stores, as it is when recalling his reluctant participation in a tiger shoot in India. 'In order to belong to the inner circle of free-range travellers you have to be willing to choose the hard and hazardous bits ' and this is where Eric Newby is so outstandingly good' ' Punch 'Whatever his may be he allows us to accompany him vicariously on it . . . and his book is a delight to read' Auberon Waugh 'Everything Eric Newby has written is a joy.

9780330314916	The orchard keeper	Cormac McCarthy		Set in a small, remote community in rural Tennessee in the years between the two world wars, "The Orchard Keeper" is an early classic from one of America's finest and most celebrated authors. It tells of John Wesley Rattner, a young boy, and Marion Sylder, an outlaw and bootlegger who, unbeknownst to either of them, has killed the boy's father. Cormac McCarthy's debut novel is a magnificent evocation of an American landscape, and of a lost American time.  'The feeling for the land and seasons is so intense as to be part of the story and there are scenes one will never forget . . . A complicated and evocative exposition of the transience of life'" Harper's"  'A true American original' "Newsweek"	1994	Picador						ZZZ000000
9780330314923	Outer dark	Cormac McCarthy		By the author of the critically acclaimed Border Trilogy, "Outer Dark" is a novel at once mythic and starkly evocative, set in an unspecified place in Appalachia sometime around the turn of the century.

The result is as rich, vivid and compelling as any collection of short fictional stories' "Independent on Sunday "  As with his previous bestseller, "The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat," Oliver Sacks uses case studies to illustrate the myriad ways in which neurological conditions can affect our sense of self, our experience of the world, and how we relate to those around us. Writing with his trademark blend of scientific rigour and human compassion, he describes patients such as the colour-blind painter or the surgeon with compulsive tics that disappear in the operating theatre; patients for whom disorientation and alienation - but also adaptation - are inescapable facts of life.  'Sacks' great gift is his capacity to place himself in the position of his subjects, to see the world the way they see it and to empathize with their condition with great compassion but without patronage or pity' " Daily Telegraph"  'Writing simply and beautifully, Sacks uses individual case histories to reveal the infinite complexities of the human mind' "Daily Mail"	1995	Picador						ZZZ000000

With that crossing, he begins an arduous and often dreamlike journey into a country where men meet ghosts and violence strikes as suddenly as heat-lightning--a world where there is no order "save that which death has put there."An essential novel by any measure, The Crossing is luminous and appalling, a book that touches, stops, and starts the heart and mind at once.	1998-11	Picador						ZZZ000000
9780330373449	England, England	Julian Barnes		As every schoolboy knows, you can fit the whole of England on the Isle of Wight. In Julian Barnes's new novel, the grotesque, visionary tycoon Sir Jack Pitman takes the saying literally and does exactly that. He constructs on the island 'The Project', a vast heritage centre containing everything 'English', from Buck House to Stonehenge, from Manchester United to the White Cliffs of Dover. The project is monstrous, risky and vastly successful. Indeed it gradually begins to rival 'Old' England and threatens to supersede it.   "'Both ambitious and serious -- real if you like. Dive at those dump-bins.'" Andrew Marr, Observer  "'A brilliant, Swiftian fantasy.'" Economist  "'There is no more intelligent writer on the literary scene. In this novel he is also moving. He has written nothing more poignant and enticing.'" John Carey, Sunday Times  "'The novel has memorable characters and sentences, but its main impact will be through its penetrating ideas.'"

9780330493727	Radical chic & Mau-mauing the flak catchers,& The painted word	Tom Wolfe		RADICAL CHIC is Tom Wolfe's hilarious dissection of the need among wealthy liberals in late '60s America to be seen to support the correct political causes - even if that meant giving champagne receptions for the feared Black Panther Party.  MAU-MAUING THE FLAK CATCHERS takes a satirical look at how, during that period of cultural upheaval, minority groups from the ghettoes refined the art of intimidating the white bureaucracy. In these essays, Wolfe's supercharged yet consummately controlled prose transports the reader back to the heady days of hippie revolution and Black Power.  THE PAINTED WORD is Wolfe's insightful, flamboyant and supremely readable survey of Modern Art. Taking in Picasso, Pollock and Warhol, he describes the tense relationship between bohemian artists and their wealthy patrons, and concludes that modern art is Theory - the paintings and sculptures themselves are mere illustrations of the text.  'Tome Wolfe is a journalist who always manages to combine an encylopedic store of inside knowledge with the obstinate detachment of a visitor from Mars, not ot mention a brilliant style and incisive wit' "San Francisco Chronicle"	2002	Picador						ZZZ000000

As Maskell attempts to come to terms with what has happened to his life, he embarks on his memoirs, retracing his tortuous path from his recruitment at Cambridge to the airless upper regions of the establishment. Beautifully written, filled with convincing fictional portraits of Maskells co-conspirators, and vibrant with the mysteries of loyalty and identity, The Untouchable places John Banville in the select company of both Conrad and le Carr.	1998-12	Picador						ZZZ000000

As characters, too, surface and reappear, their lives are slowly, painstakingly revealed. Through frozen moments and stolen glances, their stories ' and histories ' are told, their emotions exposed, their souls stripped bare. Threaded together by Tim Winton's haunting prose, the tales in Minimum of Two ultimately offer an optimistic view of the world in which we live. 'Winton . . . writes with a muscular looseness which is suited perfectly to the people and places he is describing' The Times 'Tim Winton has cracked something essential about modern Australia: how to find meaning in the intimate and terrible parts of contemporary family life, set against a landscape which is inhumanly vast' Evening Standard 'The vividness and clarity that Mr Winton responds to in nature are also beautifully embodied in his own writing' The Economist	2003	Picador						ZZZ000000
9780330486446	Feminine gospels	Carol Ann Duffy		Carol Ann Duffy is the most widely-acclaimed poet in Britain today. In FEMININE GOSPELS, Duffy draws on women's experience - both personal and historical - in poems which celebrate, elegise and eroticise the female condition.

FEMININE GOSPELS is a brilliant successor to Duffy's best-selling collection THE WORLD'S WIFE. The PB is guaranteed to build on the success of the HB.  'Dazzling . . .

9780330491587	Balsamic Dreams	Joe Queenan		From the bestselling author of "Red Lobster, White Trash and the Blue Lagoon" comes a vintage Queenan tirade chronicling the evolution of his own Baby Boomer Generation. How did a generation that started out at Woodstock andMonterey end up at Crate & Barrel? How did a generation that promised to "teach its children well" end up with a progeny so evil they could give Damien from "The Omen "a run for his money? And what is so fascinating about porcini mushrooms? Professional iconoclast Queenan shows how a generation with so much promise lost its way by confusing pop culture with culture and mistaking lifestyle for life. "Queenan on The Sixties: " "Baby Boomers who never saw Hendrix, did drugs, locked or loaded an AK-47 in country or bedded down with a girl named Radiance now all pretend they did. It's like those Civil War reenactment buffs who have drunk so much Wild Turkey they actually think they were at Chickamauga." "Queenan on Death": "A generation whose primary cultural artifact is the Filofax has enormous difficulty shoehorning death into its schedule: it's inconvenient, time-consuming and stressful.

"In St. Petersburg for a music festival, Zach encounters the red-headed Aline in the Matisse Room at the Hermitage and is immediately bewitched. The A-Z chase that follows leads to India, but no sooner do the principals arrive than other characters appear between the sheets, among them five blackshorts, a gang of soot-smudged, grease-smeared cat burglars; a girl who tends pigs, and wants to keep her man; a gipsy of the pole-vaulter caste, one of the gang, whose wants are few - a stolen picture, a box of paints and a woman - but fateful." "A burning corpse, a thief in the night, a moment of dawning realization: leading the reader on a dazzling, dizzying dance through the alphabet, and weaving a vivid, vibrant tapestry as rich as anything painted by Matisse, Red is at once a love story and a story about the love of art, about life imitating art, about the end of love - and the end of life."--BOOK JACKET.	2006-01	Picador						ZZZ000000

9780330440288	Meaning of Recognition,New Essays 2001-2005	Clive James		Literary critic, cultural commentator, TV personality, journalist, poet, political analyst, satirist and Formula One fan: Clive James is a man (and master) of many talents, and the essays collected here are testament to that fact. Whether discussing Bing Crosby, Bruno Schulz or Shakespeare, he manages to prioritise style and substance simultaneously, his tone never less than pitch-perfect, his argument always considered. With each phrase carefully crafted and each piece offering cause for thought, the resulting volume - which takes the reader from London to Bali, theatre to library, from pre-election campaigning to sitting in front of the TV at home, watching The Sopranos and The West Wing - is remarkable not only for its range and insight, but also its intimacy and honesty. 'Clive James realised early on that a quick wit needs to be harnessed to a patient hand if the writer is going to please anyone other than himself, and set about polishing his sentences until they gleamed . . . You'd hate him if you didn't enjoy reading him so much' Daily Telegraph	2006-11-05	Picador						ZZZ000000
9780330434324	Grace	Linn Ullmann		Johan has bargained with Death for years: when he was a boy, he prayed that Death take his father, not his mother; when he was a man, Death kindly removed his wife, Alice, allowing him to marry Mai, the love of his life. Now, Death has come for him, and Johan needs to strike one last bargain: when the moment arrives, he wants Mai to promise that she will help him on his way out of the world.  Johan has been mainly a paragon of mediocrity; it is only through his love for Mai that he has seen the greater possibilities that life can sometimes offer. He is determined that his passing will be dignified, controlled - perhaps even comforting. But when the time comes, and Mai has finally agreed to help him, he is no longer sure even that he has asked the right question. His deathbed is not as he imagined. His life - as a husband, lover and father - was never what it could have been. And why is it exactly, he wonders, that his one true love has agreed to be his angel of death?  Linn Ullmann's haunting novel portrays a passionate love affair and asks difficult questions about life, love and death. Finally, in prose of cool precision, deep insight and dark wit, it illustrates how the most ordinary of lives can, in the end, be unexpectedly touched by grace.  'Ullmann is a fine writer, complex, intelligent and scrupulous. The drama of private life, and of the here and now, continues to require voices such as hers' Daily Telegraph	2007-01-05	Picador						ZZZ000000

Lewis had to learn to face the world alone - which he has done with a limited amount of success. Anna's immediate problem is her mother, Rita, who runs a boarding house in Yarmouth. She has suffered a fall, and really ought to be cared for by someone other than her only paying guest (if that is indeed his status), the retired music-hall star Vernon Savoy (aka "Cabbage", ho ho). So Anna leaves her London life behind and grimly sets off to do her duty. As Lewis and Anna, both solitary drifters, search for solutions, their lives become entangled in the most unexpected ways, and they find themselves having to face troubling truths about who they are, how they got there and what they might become - with electrifying consequences.	2007	Picador						ZZZ000000

9780330453738	What I Do,More True Tales of Everyday Craziness	Jon Ronson		In "What I Do: More True Tales of Everyday Craziness," the second volume of Jon Ronson's collected Guardian journalism, he hilariously demonstrates how our everyday lives are determined by the craziest thoughts and obsessions; how we spend our time believing in and getting worked up by complete nonsense. But also, as he chillingly demonstrates, there are clever people working in the highest echelons of business who are employed to spot, nurture and exploit the irrationalities of those among us who can barely cope as it is.  In part one, read about the time Jon inadvertently made a lewd gesture to a passing fourteen-year-old girl late at night in the lobby of a country-house hotel. And about his burgeoning obsession with a new neighbour who refused to ask him what he did for a living, despite Jon's constant dropping of intriguing hints. And about the embarrassment of being caught recycling small talk at a party.  In part two, read some of Jon's longer stories, which explore manifestations of insanity in the wider world: the tiny town of North Pole, Alaska, where it's Christmas 365 days of the year; behind the scenes at "Deal or No Deal," which Jon likens to a cult with Noel Edmonds as its high priest; a meeting with TV hypnotist Paul McKenna, who has joined forces with a self-help guru who once stood trial for murder - but can they cure Jon of his one big phobia?  As hilarious as it is perturbing, Jon Ronson's new collection is a treat for everyone who has ever suspected themselves to be at the mercy of forces they can barely comprehend.	2007-11-02	Picador						ZZZ000000

9780330469715	Brothers	Yu Hua		When Baldy Li's mother marries Song Gang's father, the two boys become brothers. Although they are inseparable as children, their ambitions and personalities are very different, and become more, rather than less, pronounced as they grow into adulthood. Song Gang is thoughtful and serious; Baldy Li, meanwhile, is obsessed by sex (even before he fully understands what the act involves) and an unquenchable desire to make something of himself - for Baldy Li plans to become a man of the world... in all senses of the word. And although Baldy Li is a man who always (well, almost always) keeps his word, so too is his brother - but even here, their differences are obvious, for while Song Gang promises to put his brother first in everything they do, Baldy Li promises himself he will capture the heart of the town beauty, Lin Hong... who just happens to be the love of Song Gang's life. Set against the brutality and violence of the Cultural Revolution and its aftermath, Brothers is a novel about boys becoming men, about family feuds and the ties that bind - that bind all of us, even those who refuse to be bound by mere convention or custom because they are bound for far greater glories...	2009-04-03	Pan Macmillan						ZZZ000000
9780330503990	Nobody Move	Denis Johnson		Jimmy Luntz owes money to a man called Juarez. Trouble is, Juarez isn't the most patient of men. And when he gets bored of waiting, he sends someone round to collect. Luntz doesn't actually plan to shoot the guy, but the way he sees it, it's shoot or be shot. Either way, though, Luntz is out of his league, and he knows it: nobody messes with Juarez -- or, at least, nobody messes with Juarez and lives to tell the tale. Against all the odds, however, it seems that somebody up there is looking out for Luntz, if only he can keep his cool.  A story of mistaken identity, blackmail and murder, of bent judges, wronged alcoholics and colostomy bags, "Nobody Move" is "No Country for Old Men" as written by Denis Johnson.  Praise for Denis Johnson's previous novel, "Tree of Smoke," which won the US National Book Award 2007:  'A "Catch-22" for our times' Alan Warner, "Observer "  'A heart-stopping reminder of what fiction can do' "Sunday Telegraph"	2009-06-05	Picador USA						ZZZ000000
9780330427463	Dr Ragab's Universal Language	Robert Twigger		Charlatan. Guru. Master of disguise. Ahead of his time, wise beyond his years, a simple opportunist or the great pretender; however you choose to see him, one fact is certain: Dr Ragab is a mysterious man. Talked about by pretty much everyone in 1920s Cairo, only a few get the chance to make his acquaintance, and fewer still - one person, in fact - get to study his life lessons. Hertwig is that lucky soul. Or not so lucky, perhaps: not when he finds himself, at the very end of the second world war, imprisoned in a bunker in Germany by a gang of thugs. To make matters worse, it's not just any bunker; it's Hertwig's own bunker, and he's built it to be 100% escape-proof. And yet . . . there is a possible way out. Not in the conventional sense, it's true, but when you're holed up several feet underground, unsure of how long your captors plan to keep you alive, convention isn't necessarily a good thing, as Dr Ragab would be the first to proclaim - and it's his universal language that may just provide Hertwig with the escape route he needs. As unconventional as the eponymous Ragab, Robert Twigger's novel takes the reader on a surreal journey, exploring such diverse topics as far right ideologies, middle east mysticism and the art of communicating via food preparation and presentation. Clever, funny and thought-provoking, Dr Ragab's Universal Language is, in every sense, beyond belief: part tall tale and part self-help manual, it is, like Dr R himself, impossible to pin down - or, indeed, to put down.	2009-07-03	Picador						ZZZ000000
9780330457514	Cliffhanger	T. J. Middleton		"It sounded simple enough. "  "'Audrey, ' I said. 'Audrey, why don't we go out, for a stroll?' "  "'In this weather?' "  "'Clear the cobwebs, ' I said, pulling on my boots, and she shrugged her shoulders and said, 'Why not?' "  "Cause I'm going to shove you over the bloody cliff, Audrey, that's why not."  Al Greenwood has decided to kill his wife, and he's planned the perfect murder. But things don't turn out quite the way he hoped, and Al finds himself committing more crimes to cover his tracks.  Told through the voice of despicable yet strangely likeable Al, "Cliffhanger" is a blackly comic novel which takes its readers on a thrilling ride through Middle England. T. J. Middleton is a unique and exciting new voice, full of biting wit. Sharp, original and hugely entertaining, this is crime writing at its very best.  'Perfectly paced, with sly wit and a blackly humorous ending' "Sunday Telegraph"  'A rollicking ride . . . There is a touch of Ealing to this clever, witty seaside comedy of manners' "Independent"  'An Ayckbournesque comedy about what happens when the unhappiness of a stale marriage develops into a sharper pain . . .

9780330510905	Love and Obstacles	Aleksandar Hemon		The author of The Lazarus Project journeys with life's vagabonds in an electrifying new collection of stories Set in the darkest heart of Africa, in the backwaters of Slovenia, in the melting pot of Chicago, this brilliant collection of stories is coloured throughout by the 1992 Bosnian war. All but one of them features Bogdan, first met as a surly teenager during his diplomat father's assignment in Zaire, where he's happily corrupted by a degenerate American espionage agent. In each successive story, Bogdan recalls the surreal and salient experiences of his life: his youth with his ironically depicted family; his early determination to be a poet, his accidental sojourn in America, where he was caught after the commencement of hostilities in Bosnia; and his return to a "cesspool of insignificant, drizzly suffering", where he has a transformative night interviewing a Pulitzer Prize-winning writer. As ever, Hemon confronts pain and anonymity without blanching but also finds delicious absurdity in experience. His is the great humanity of a writer who sees life on the margins, and gives voice to what he finds in a style that is breathtakingly his own.	2009-05	Pan Macmillan						ZZZ000000
9780330457361	The blaze of obscurity	Clive James		For many people, Clive James will always be a TV presenter first and foremost, and a writer second -- this despite the fact that his adventures with the written word took place before, during and after his time on the small screen. Nevertheless, for those who remember clips of Japanese endurance gameshows and Egyptian soap operas, Clive reinventing the news or interviewing Hefner and Hepburn, Polanski and Pavarotti, Clive's 'Postcards' from Kenya, Shanghai and Dallas, or "Clive James Racing Driver," Clive's rightful place does seem to be right there -- on the box, in our homes, and almost one of the family.  However you think of him, though, and whatever you remember him for, "The Blaze of Obscurity" is perhaps Clive's most brilliant book yet. Part Clive James on TV and part "Clive James on TV," it tells the inside story of his years in television, shows Clive on top form both then and now, and proves -- once and for all -- that Clive has a way with words . . . whatever the medium.	2009-10-02	Picador						ZZZ000000
9780330511261	Ancient Gonzo Wisdom,Interviews with Hunter S. Thompson	Hunter S. Thompson		Bristling with inspired observations and wild anecdotes, this collection offers a unique insight into the voice and mind of the inimitable Hunter S. Thompson, as recorded in the pages of Playboy, The Paris Review, Esquire, and elsewhere. Fearless and unsparing, the interviews detail some of the most storied episodes of Thompson's life: a savage beating at the hands of the Hells Angels, talking football with Nixon on the 1972 Campaign Trail ("the only time in 20 years of listening to the treacherous bastard that I knew he wasn't lying"), and his unlikely run for sheriff of Aspen. Elsewhere, passionate tirades about journalism, culture, guns, drugs, and the law showcase Thompson's voice at its fiercest. Arranged chronologically, and prefaced with Anita Thompson's moving account of her husband's last years, the interviews present Hunter in all his fractured brilliance and provide an exceptional portrait of his times.	2009-10-02	Picador						ZZZ000000
9780330511353	Once Again to Zelda,Fifty Great Dedications and Their Stories	Marlene Wagman-Geller		Charlotte Bronte dedicated "Jane Eyre" to William Makepeace Thackeray, setting literary London ablaze with gossip. Ayn Rand dedicated "Atlas Shrugged" to both her husband and her lover. Sylvia Plath dedicated "The Bell Jar" to her friends. And F. Scott Fitzgerald dedicated "The Great Gatsby" to his wife, Zelda, the tumultuous love of his life. The dedication of a novel is the most personal and public of gestures, and yet we don't often stop to consider how it came to be inspired. This charming 'behind the scenes' book traces the relationships immortalized in the dedications to fifty novels that are an intrinsic part of literary and pop culture. Sometimes tragic, often romantic, and always engaging, these are intimate glimpses into the lives of the writers we admire and the people they loved.	2009-10-02	Picador						ZZZ000000

From a divorce about to enter into an arranged marriage to a teenaged poet who develops a relationship with a lonely widower, from singing teachers to housewives to white-collar businessmen, Chaudhuri deftly explores the juxtaposition of the old and new worlds in his native India. Here are stories as sweet and humane as they are incisive and revealing.  'Brilliant . . .

Since 1994, their lives have been a turmoil of theft, betrayal and family strife as the new South Africa helps itself to their stock...David Cohen has gone some way to providing Johannesburg with its own Mordecai Richler."--"Evening Standard"Brothers-in-law Harry and Jack run a Johannesburg furniture business that is being robbed repeatedly. The investigation of the crime reveals that the perpetrators lie even closer than the proprietors expected--and explores also how the social forces at work in South Africa today have made crime the country's biggest growth industry.Written on the tenth anniversary of the fall of apartheid, "People Who Have Stolen From Me" describes a nation in the throes of rebuilding itself, through the eyes of two witty, perceptive men."One of the most important books you will read this year." --"Sunday Times," South Africa "A perceptive and original take on the causes and consequences of South Africa's current crime wave....Social analysis with verve and insight." -"-Kirkus Reviews" "Acclaimed British-South African author David Cohen presents a pressing empirical question about South Africa: Just who has stolen from whom? The balance of detachment and intimacy is Cohen's greatest strength...This is not so much a book about crime as it is about relative moralities." --"This Day," South Africa "An important piece of reportage that vividly and sensitively demonstrates how difficult it is for societies, where justice has long been perverted, to change overnight. ...A comprehensive account of the current condition that also does much to explain the failing grade in crime onthe national report card." --"Washington Times""Rather than taking a broad sociological approach, Cohen brilliantly uses one store-and its owners, customers, staff, thieves and swindlers-as a microcosm of the greater problem. The dn0 strength of Cohen's characterizations and narrative provide for a portrait of the new South Africa that many will find illuminating, fascinating and, sadly, universal."--"Publishers Weekly""A startlingly refreshing examination of the new South Africa's cathartic rebirth [and] one of the first books to deal with the story behind the headlines." --"South African Times," LondonDavid Cohen, an award-winning journalist and a native of Johannesburg, is the author of "Chasing the Red, White, and Blue" (Picador 2001).

9780712665896	Flaubert,a life	Frederick Brown		Gustave Flaubert, whose Madame Bovary outraged France's right-thinking bourgeoisie when it was first published in 1836, is brought to life in Frederick Brown's new biography in all his singularity and brilliance. Frederick Brown's portrayal is of an artist fraught with contradictions - his wit and bravado coexisting with great vulnerability. A sedentary man by nature, Flaubert undertook epic voyages through Egypt and the Middle East. He could be flamboyantly uncouth, but was frantically devoted to a beautifully cadenced prose. While energized by his camaraderie with male friends, who included Turgenev, the Goncourt brothers, Zola and Maupassant, he depended for emotional nurturing upon maternal women, most notably George Sand. His mistresses - French, Egyptian, and English - fed his richly erotic imagination and found their way into his fictional characters. Nineteenth-century France literally put Flaubert on trial for portraying 'lewd behaviour' in Madame Bovary. But it also made him a celebrity and, indirectly, brought about his financial ruin, probably hastening his sudden death at the age of fifty-nine. Although writing was something like torture for him, it preoccupied his mind and dominated his life. He privately dreamed of popular success, which he achieved with Madame Bovary, but adamently refused to sacrifice to it his ideal of artistic integrity. Of Flaubert's life, his inner world, his times and his legacy, Frederick Brown's magisterial biography is a revelation.	2007-05-03	Pimlico						ZZZ000000

I was alone. Facing this wild animal with fear beating behind my eyes."

9781416522171	The True Power of Water,Healing and Discovering Ourselves	Masaru Emoto		This follow up to Dr Emoto's international bestseller The Hidden Messages in Water is the result of his latest scientific research into the healing properties of water.

Accompanied by numerous compelling photographs showing that water crystals are transformed according to the positive and negative thoughts they are exposed to, this book provides practical steps that anyone can use to improve their own well-being by learning how to consciously interact with water, the primary component of our bodies. Also discussed is Dr Emoto's research into the effects of prayer to purify rain water, helping to bring healing to the earth, as well as the mechanistic limitations of Western medicine and its understanding of both healing and disease. No one who reads Dr Emoto's works will ever take water for granted again.	2005-12-05	POCKET BOOKS						MED073000

Such is the teaching of the bestselling author/relationship therapist team, Harville Hendrix and Helen LaKelly Hunt. In their newest book, they argue that many of us have trouble accepting and integrating the affection and appreciation we so deeply desire. We tell ourselves that we're not getting what we want and need because other people are either not loving us enough or not loving us in the right way. But the truth is that we are loved, we just don't see it. Instead we brush away the compliments and praise, and we don't even know we are doing it.In RECEIVING LOVE, the focus is on how this phenomenon operates in intimate relationships, shaping conflicts and disappointments, and on the steps needed to dissolve the barriers to enable us to open our hearts to love.	2006-05-31	POCKET BOOKS						ZZZ000000

9781416522621	The wisdom paradox,how your mind can grow stronger as you brain grows older	Elkhonon Goldberg		in THE WISDOM PARADOX, world-renowned neuropsychologist Elkhonon Goldberg argues that although some mental abilities (such as recent-memory recall) decline as the mind enters the autumn season of our lifespan and we increasingly experience 'senior moments', the brain actually becomes more powerful in its ability to recognize patterns. As a result, we are able to make decisions at more intuitive and effective levels -- a late-emerging mental strength he terms 'wisdom'. in lively, accessible prose, Goldberg delves into the mechanisms of the mind, outlining how the elegant structures of the brain develop and change over the course of a lifetime. Drawing on recent and historical examples of leaders and artists who achieved their greatest successes late in life -- from Goethe to Ronald Reagan -- Goldberg illustrates the effects of an emerging scientific understanding of the biology of wisdom. Most provocatively, he outlines how a 'cognitive fitness' programme can both curtail the negative mental effects of ageing and enhance our decision-making powers. insightful and inspiring, THE WISDOM PARADOX is a groundbreaking look into our mental machinery that will change the way you think about ageing -- and about thinking.	2007	Pocket Books						ZZZ000000

9781416502074	The Fruits of War,How Military Conflict Accelerates Technology	Michael White		Since man first wielded a stick in anger, war and conflict have been prime movers in the progress of science and technology. In our earliest days the impetus may have been as simple as protecting territory or a food supply; more recently science has benefited from massive injections of cash when national security is at stake. But as Michael White demonstrates in this superbly wide-ranging and brilliant history of innovation, almost all major technological developments can be traced back to times of war. From the arrow to nuclear power; from cuneiform to the credit card; from the chariot to the bullet train and from the tribal drum to the Internet, our creativity owes much to the destructiveness of our nature. Accessible, thought-provoking and chock-full of fascinating facts, THE FRUITS OF WAR is a superb history of science and innovation that shows how the best of humanity often flows from its worst.	2007-06-30	Pocket						ZZZ000000

9780743409216	The Camino,a journey of the spirit	Shirley MacLaine		It has been nearly three decades since Shirley MacLaine commenced her brave and public commitment to chronicling her personal quest for spiritual understanding. In testament to the endurance and vitality of her message, each of her eight legendary bestsellers -- from Don't Fall Off the Mountain to My Lucky Stars -- continues today to attract, dazzle, and transform countless new readers. Now Shirley is back -- with her most breathtakingly powerful and unique book yet. This is the story of a journey. It is the eagerly anticipated and altogether startling culmination of Shirley MacLaine's extraordinary -- and ultimately rewarding -- road through life. The riveting odyssey began with a pair of anonymous handwritten letters imploring Shirley to make a difficult pilgrimage along the Santiago de Compostela Camino in Spain. Throughout history, countless illustrious pilgrims from all over Europe have taken up the trail. It is an ancient -- and allegedly enchanted -- pilgrimage. People from St. Francis of Assisi and Charlemagne to Ferdinand and Isabella to Dante and Chaucer have taken the journey, which comprises a nearly 500-mile trek across highways, mountains and valleys, cities and towns, and fields. Now it would be Shirley's turn. For Shirley, the Camino was both an intense spiritual and physical challenge. A woman in her sixth decade completing such a grueling trip on foot in thirty days at twenty miles per day was nothing short of remarkable. But even more astounding was the route she took spiritually: back thousands of years, through past lives to the very origin of the universe. Immensely gifted with intelligence, curiosity, warmth, and a profound openness to people and places outside her own experience, Shirley MacLaine is truly an American treasure. And once again, she brings her inimitable qualities of mind and heart to her writing. Balancing and negotiating the revelations inspired by the mysterious energy of the Camino, she endured her exhausting journey to Compostela until it gradually gave way to a far more universal voyage: that of the soul. Through a range of astonishing and liberating visions and revelations, Shirley saw into the meaning of the cosmos, including the secrets of the ancient civilizations of Atlantis and Lemuria, insights into human genesis, the essence of gender and sexuality, and the true path to higher love. With rich insight, humility, and her trademark grace, Shirley MacLaine gently leads us on a sacred adventure toward an inexpressibly transcendent climax. The Camino promises readers the journey of a thousand lifetimes.	2001-07-02	Pocket						ZZZ000000
9781416511533	Prisoners of the Japanese,POWs of World War II in the Pacific	Gavan Daws		Gavan Daws combined ten years of documentary research and hundreds of interviews with POWs on three continents to write this shattering re-creation of the experience of Allied POWs of the Second World War in the Pacific -- British, Australian, American and Dutch. The Japanese army took over 140,000 military prisoners, and one in four died at the hands of their captors. Drawing directly on the vivid memories of the survivors, Daws brings the reader heart-breakingly close to the atrocities of the Burma--Siam railway and the Bataan death march, the horrors of Japanese medical experiments, the struggles of POWs to stay alive and remain human, the permanent scars that the survivors carry, and the incomprehensible refusal of their own governments to support their attempts to get an apology from Japan. Daws' account, which was neither researched nor written under military auspices, is the humanly indispensable reverse side of official history. This book is his 'best effort to tell a story conspicuously absent from the official histories of both sides, missing in action, so to speak: the truth of life according to the POW.' In this, he has succeeded masterfully.	2007-05-08	Simon & Schuster, Limited						ZZZ000000

9781416526018	The Politics of Pleasure,A Portrait of Benjamin Disraeli	William M. Kuhn		He was acknowledged to be a brilliant debater and parliamentarian, and is still England's first and only Jewish prime minister, but there was much more to Benjamin Disraeli than his career as a nineteenth-century politician. Dandy, novelist, social climber, he often behaved as if politics was merely a conduit to a more interesting life rather than an intellectual vocation. This new biography takes four areas of Disraeli's complex character and through them constructs an entirely new portrait of one of our most fascinating prime ministers. Exploring Disraeli's attitudes to society, the monarchy, his own sexuality and his innate political daring, William Kuhn rediscovers his irreverence and sheds new light on the man and his legacy. Drawing on primary sources and much original research, THE POLITICS OF PLEASURE seeks to restore the core characteristic of humanity to someone who has long been judged merely another eminent but worthy Victorian. It also explores the game of politics as Disraeli saw it -- the fun and pleasure of it, as a means of persuading the electorate to take an interest in a way that often seems lost today.	2007-05-08	Pocket						ZZZ000000

Jenn Corbin appeared to have it all: two little boys, a posh home in the suburbs of Atlanta, and a husband - Dr Bart Corbin, a successful dentist - who was handsome and brilliant. Then, in December 2004, Jenn was found dead with a bullet in her head, apparently by suicide. Only later would detectives learn that another woman in Dr Corbin's past had been found years earlier with nearly the exact same wound to the head, also ruled a suicide. In TOO LATE TO SAY GOODBYE, Ann Rule - working in cooperation with victims' families, police investigators, and sources from Georgia to Australia - unravels the now-sensational deaths. What emerges is an incredible tale of jealous rage; of stunning evidence that runs from the steamy to the macabre; and of a fateful, mind-boggling coincidence that appears to have motivated the killings. The definitive unravelling of one of the strangest murder investigations of our time, this is the greatest achievement of a truly great writing career.	2007	Pocket						TRU002000

The Labour Party coming to power in 1997 could have been the start of a new political dawn for Mark and for Britain. But instead, big business and war-mongering thrived under New Labour, and in many ways the working class seemed to become more marginalised. Petty bickering and in-fighting racked the SWP, numbers dwindled horribly, socialism became a dirty word and Mark Steel began to think the unthinkable . . . do I really want to belong to this rabble anymore? At the same time, entering his forties, Mark's personal life began to disintegrate. Spending many sleepless nights on the sofa, watching inane cable TV into the early hours of the morning, Mark asked himself the question, 'What is Going On?' In a book that goes right to the heart of Britain and the problems it suffers today, Mark wonders why over a million people marching in London couldn't stop the war in Iraq, why supermarkets are killing the small town centres of Britain and why George Galloway went on Celebrity Big Brother destroying any political credibility he may have had in the blink of a cat's eye.

As the 1790s began, a fragile America teetered on the brink of oblivion, Russia towered as a vast imperial power, and France plunged into revolution.

And here is the richest cast of characters to walk upon the world stage: Washington and Jefferson, Louis XVI and Robespierre, Catherine the Great, Adams, Napoleon, and Selim III. Exquisitely written and utterly compelling, The Great Upheaval vividly depicts an arc of revolutionary fervour stretching from Philadelphia and Paris to St Petersburg and Cairo -- with fateful results.	2009-03-02	Simon & Schuster, Limited						ZZZ000000

It describes how she met Obama, the kind of partnership they have created, the career as a lawyer and health care executive she pursued in Chicago, her views about political life and her aptitude for it, and her profile as a mother. Based on the public record and on interviews she has given in the past, this is the definitive biography of the new First Lady.	2009-04-06	Pocket Books						ZZZ000000

9781847394170	A Day and a Night and a Day	Glen Duncan		This is the story of Augustus Rose -- half African-American, half Italian; journalist, lover, restauranteur, unlikely terrorist -- and his interrogator, Harper, a Grand Inquisitor armed with twenty-first century cruelty, clarity and charisma. As Harper's assault on his body and soul intensifies, Augustus raises the only shield he has: memory. His mind turns to the women in his life, from his outcast mother, to the vigilante who recruited him, to the last female tenderness he's ever likely to know. Outshining them all is the memory of the stunning, wealthy and white Selina, and the love affair that began in 1960s Manhattan -- an epic, taboo mix of politics and passion that would lead Augustus from Harlem to Greenwich Village, from El Salvador to Barcelona, from Morocco to a bleak Scottish island where hope or death must overcome...	2010	Simon & Schuster, Limited						ZZZ000000
9781847392336	The Favorites	Mary Yukari Waters		Kyoto 1978. Fourteen-year-old Sarah Rexford returns to Japan with her mother for the first time in five years, to stay with the family at her mother's childhood home. Having begun her teenage years in America, where she is popular, confident and assured, it is a shock for Sarah to find herself ill at ease and unsure of what to say or how to say it, whilst her usually quiet, rather shy mother at once returns to her engaging, accomplished and respected former self in the company of family and old friends. As Sarah begins to reaquaint herself with her relatives and learn more about the culture she came from, she discovers a secret that stretches across three generations, its presence looming over the family home. Personal boundaries are firmly drawn in traditional Kyoto, and actions are not always what they appear. In this carefully articulated world, where every look and gesture has meaning, Sarah must learn the rules by which her mother, aunts and grandmother live.	2010-05-01	Simon & Schuster, Limited						ZZZ000000
9781847394125	American Rust	Philipp Meyer		Set in a beautiful but dying Pennsylvania steel town, American Rust is a novel of the lost American dream and the desperation that arises from its loss. It is the story of two young men bound to the town by family, responsibility, inertia and the beauty around them who dream of a future beyond the factories, abandoned homes, and the polluted river. Isaac is the smartest kid in town, left behind to care for his sick father after his mother commits suicide and his sister Lee moves away. Now Isaac wants out too. Not even his best friend, Billy Poe, can stand in his way: broad-shouldered Billy, always ready for a fight, still living in his mother's trailer. Then, on the very day of Isaac's leaving, something happens that changes the friends' fates and tests the loyalties of their friendship and those of their lovers, families, and the town itself. Evoking John Steinbeck's novels of restless lives during the Great Depression, American Rust is an extraordinarily moving novel about the bleak realities that battle our desire for transcendance, and the power of love and friendship to redeem us.	2010	Simon & Schuster, Limited						ZZZ000000

Determined to clear his name, Louis is forced to delve behind the bedroom doors of the wealthiest women in the county as he uncovers a series of similar murders: young, handsome, penniless men who have been keeping company with rich, married, powerful women.

9781847392183	The Last Game,Love, Death and Football	Jason Cowley		On 26 May 1989, the final day of the season, Arsenal travelled to Anfield to face the mighty Liverpool. What followed was one of the most remarkable football matches at the end of one of the most dramatic and politically charged seasons in English football history; a season that marked the transition between old and new football and which would come to be seen as a threshold for astonishing changes not just in football but in the wider culture. Featuring interviews with the main players in this drama, including many of the legendary figures who took part in that famous final game, The Last Game is a probing and resonant work of dramatic reportage that reflects on the stark changes the national sport has undergone in twenty tumultuous years. Journeying from the intense and hostile terraces of the 1980s, where male violence and tribalism coupled with decrepit stadiums led to tragedies like Heysel and Hillsborough, to the new commercialism that has engulfed the modern game, where fans have turned customers and, some say, security has come at the cost of identity, The Last Game tells the story of how a nation was changed by one astonishing game.	2010-04-01	POCKET BOOKS						ZZZ000000
9781849832342	Tycoon	Harold Robbins		Sexy, outrageous and irresistible, Tycoon is Harold Robbins at his rip-roaring best. Jack Lear rises from a modest Jewish background to take on the WASP world, but never quite feels he's succeeded in his ambition to be accepted as one of them. Making his fortune as a pioneering radio and television broadcaster and founding a landmark network isn't enough - nor is the money, fame and women who go with it. He continues to hunger for what he cannot have. Here is a tale that only Harold Robbins could tell: of Jack's torrid relationship with his first wife, a WASP social heiress; of his affairs with everybody from chamber maids to duchesses; of his second marriage to a world-class beauty and society figure; and ultimately of his life-long struggle to make his network No. 1, and to give it a sense of class that sets it apart from all the others.	2010-04-29	Simon & Schuster, Limited						ZZZ000000
9781849832359	The Predators	Harold Robbins		THE PREDATORS takes you on a wild odyssey through the gaudy and reckless life of Jerry Cooper: his struggle to survive in depression New York; his years in Europe during the war; his friends, wives and lovers; his life in organised crime and his entrance into the world of high-powered international business. Into the world of Plesscassier. The premier purveyor of vintage French spring water, its owner Jean Pierre Martine is a consummate rogue whose all-consuming greed is rivalled only by his unbridled sexual desires. But Plescassier is not yet the global colossus it may one day become. For all Jean Pierre's flair, the company lacks that single-minded individual who will propel it to its rightful place at the top of the international market. Jerry Cooper with his enormous appetites, financial genius and criminal past is such a person. As is Giselle, the former French courtesan, who is the driving force behind both Jerry and Jean Pierre, who inflames their ambition, their vanity, their destiny, their dream. And shares their bed.	2010-04-29	Simon & Schuster, Limited						ZZZ000000

9781849832373	The Stallion	Harold Robbins		Continuing the phenomenal story in The Betsy, The Stallion reintroduces the Hardeman family and the cut-throat world of their vast automobile empire, where the stakes are high and every man, and woman, is a gambler. Loren Hardeman, known as 'Number One', is gradually transferring control of Bethlehem Motors to his grandson, Loren Hardeman III - a man possessed with his father's cunning, but sadly lacking in his ability to go for the kill. So when Angelo Perino, an outsider previously nurtured by 'Number One', threatens the position held by Hardeman III, what ensues is a battle of wills in which integrity takes a backseat to animal instinct, and in which there can only be one winner. Bursting with huge ingredients of lust, greed, sex and intrigue - and a plot full of twists and double-crosses - this is Harold Robbins at his sizzling best.	2010-04-29	Simon & Schuster, Limited						ZZZ000000

9781847391827	The Clinton Tapes,Wrestling History in the White House	Taylor Branch		The Clinton Tapes was a secret project, initiated by Clinton, to preserve for future historians an unfiltered record of presidential experience. During his eight years in office, Clinton met with Taylor Branch in the White House, usually late at night, to answer questions and tell stories. Branch recorded seventy-nine of their dialogues to compile a trove of raw information about a presidency as it happened. Branch then recorded his own detailed recollections immediately after each session, covering not only the subjects discussed but also the look and feel of each evening with the president. Their discussions were unpredictable, intense, and candid. At any given moment the president could leap from memories to a current crisis or problems with his daughter's homework. The resultant text captures Clinton from many angles. Branch's firsthand narrative is confessional, unsparing, and personal. What should an objective prompter say when the President of the United States seeks advice, argues facts, or lodges complaints against the press? The relationship that emerges from these interviews is dynamic, both affectionate and charged, with flashes of anger and humor. President Clinton drives the history, but this story is also about two friends.	2010-09-02	Simon & Schuster, Limited						ZZZ000000
9781847394347	The Year That Changed the World,The Untold Story Behind the Fall of the Berlin Wall	Michael Meyer		'Mr Gorbachev, tear down this wall!' This declamation by president Ronald Reagan when visiting Berlin in 1987 is widely cited as the clarion call that brought the Cold War to an end. The West had won, so this version of events goes, because the West had stood firm. American and Western European resoluteness had brought an evil empire to its knees. Michael Meyer, in this extraordinarily compelling account of the revolutions that roiled Eastern Europe in 1989, begs to differ. Drawing together breathtakingly vivid, on-the-ground accounts of the rise of Solidarity in Poland, the stealth opening of the Hungarian border, the Velvet Revolution in Prague, and the collapse of the infamous wall in Berlin, Meyer shows that western intransigence was only one of the many factors that provoked such world-shaking change. More important, Meyer contends, were the stands taken by individuals in the thick of the struggle, leaders such as poet and playwright Vaclav Havel in Prague; Lech Walesa; the quiet and determined reform prime minister in Budapest, Miklos Nemeth; and the man who realized his empire was already lost and decided, with courage and intelligence, to let it go in peace, Soviet president Mikhail Gorbachev. Michael Meyer captures these heady days in all their rich drama and unpredictability. In doing so he provides not just a thrilling chronicle of perhaps the most important year of the 20th century but also a crucial refutation of American mythology and a misunderstanding of history that was deliberately employed to lead the United States into some of the intractable conflicts it faces today.	2010	Simon & Schuster, Limited						ZZZ000000

She went on, with her husband, to run an 180,000 acre ranch in Arizona and to raise two children, one of whom is Jeannette's memorable mother, Rosemary Smith Walls.

9781847397829	The Anthologist	Nicholson Baker		The Anthologist, is narrated by Paul Chowder, a poet of some little reknown who is sitting in his barn most of the time trying to write the introduction to a new anthology of poetry called Only Rhyme. He's having a hard time getting started because his career is falling apart, his girlfriend Roz has recently left him, and he is thinking about the poets throughout history who have suffered far worse and actually deserve to feel sorry for themselves. He has also promised his readers that he will reveal many wonderful secrets and tips and tricks about poetry, and it looks like the introduction will be a little longer than he'd thought. What unfolds is a wholly entertaining and beguiling love story about poetry, among other things; Paul tells us about all of the great poets, from Tennyson, Swinburne, and Yeats to the moderns (Roethke, Bogan, Merwin) to the contemporary scene as well as the editorial staff of The New Yorker's editorial department. And what he reveals about the rhythm and music of poetry itself is astonishing and makes you realize how incredibly important poetry is to our lives. At the same time, Paul manages just barely to realize all of this himself and what results is a tender, wonderfully romantic, often hilarious, and inspired novel.	2010	Simon & Schuster, Limited						ZZZ000000

9781416528517	Pegasus Descending	James Lee Burke		Detective Dave Robicheaux is facing the most painful and dangerous case of his career. A troubled young woman breezes into his hometown of New Iberia, Louisiana. She happens to be the daughter of Robicheaux's onetime best friend - a friend he witnessed gunned down in a bank robbery, a tragedy that forever changed Robicheaux's life. In Pegasus Descending, James Lee Burke again explores psyches as much as evidence, and tries to make sense of human behavior as well as of his characters' crimes. Richly atmospheric, frightening in its sudden violence, and replete with the sort of puzzles only the best crime fiction creates, Burke's latest novel is an unforgettable roller coaster of passion, surprise, and regret. The twists begin when Trish Klein - the only offspring of Robicheaux's Vietnam-era buddy - starts passing marked hundred-dollar bills in local casinos. Is she a good kid gone bad? A victim's child seeking revenge? A promiscuous beauty seducing everyone good within her grasp? And how does her behavior relate to the apparent suicide of another 'good' girl, an ace student named Yvonne Darbonne, who apparently participated in a college frat orgy before her death? Can Robicheaux make his peace with the demons that have haunted him since his friend's murder so many years ago? Can he figure out how a local mobster fits into all the schemes and deaths? Can Robicheaux's life be whole again when it has been shattered by so much tragedy? Once again, Burke proves why he is the virtual poet laureate of southern Louisiana, and why his novels, especially those featuring Dave Robicheaux, stand as brilliant literature and entertainment for our time.	2007-03	Simon & Schuster						ZZZ000000

9781849161244	Rant!	Ivor Gripe		There are breezes, and there are hurricanes; there is the local magistrate's court, and there is the Spanish Inquisition; there is mood music, and there is Toxic Holocaust. There are words spoken in anger. And then there is RANT. RANT is the language spoken by those who have crossed the Rubicon of Unreason and entered the Realm of Rage. Discarding the bland courtesies of polite debate and reasoned argument, they take on the deranged eloquence of motor-mouthed maniacs insult, calumny and slander spew from them like bullets from an automatic weapon. But there is a kind of verbal magnificence in their madness... In RANT!, compiler Ivor Gripe presents 1000 memorably unmeasured state-ments of full-on, blood-vessel-busting fury, loathing and intolerance from an array of contemporary luminaries who should know better than to air their prejudices in public. From Frankie Boyle's helpful advice to vegetarians ('You want to sample our vegetarian option? By all means you can f*** off!') to Jeremy Clarkson's enlight-ened views on road transport ('cyclists are trespassers in the motorists' domain... run them down!'); and from Alan Sugar's considered judgment of professional foot-ballers ('scum, total scum if they weren't football players, most of them would be in prison') to former Brazilian World Cup star Carlos Alberto's bizarre attack on Michael Owen ('he's a midget and I am not prepared to discuss him any longer'), RANT! directs its venom at a wide range of individuals and social groups. Gordon Brown, Simon Cowell, Dido, estate agents, City financiers, football referees, Liverpudlians, Japanese people, joggers and cyclists are just some of those in the firing-line. So, if you prefer the rolling boil of outrage to the gentle simmer of irritation, and the cuts and bruises of verbal fisticuffs to the cut and thrust of intelligent debate, RANT! could be just the thing for you. It promises to be one of the funniest, funkiest and most forthright humour books of 2009.	2009-10-01	Quercus						ZZZ000000

9781861059420	The man behind The Da Vinci code,an unauthorized biography of Dan Brown	Lisa Rogak		Two years ago, he was a relatively unknown author, with three novels in print that had sold a cumulative total of 20,000 copies in hardcover and paperback. Today, he is a mega-bestselling author, with more than 34 million copies of his fourth novel in print around the world. This is an adrenaline-loaded story of a non-blockbuster writer in a race against time to write his breakout novel or face the prospect of being trapped by mediocrity. Revealing little-known details of Brown's unusual work habits - involving gravity boots, an antique hourglass and voice-recognition technology - Rogak charts Brown's struggles as a writer pre-'Da Vinci Code' and the windfall that occurred once published. Why in the face of a public lawsuit for plagiarism did Brown refuse to sign an affidavit unambiguously affirming he is the sole author of ''The Da Vinci Code'? What links Brown's early career as a middle-of-the-road pop singer with his status as Random House's bestselling author to date? Drawing on personal interviews with friends and former colleagues, newspaper articles and transcripts dating back to 1998, when his first novel, ''Digital Fortress', was published, Rogak's biography will be published shortly before the general release of Ron Howard's movie version of ''The Da Vinci Code', starring Tom Hanks, Audrey Tautou and Ian McKellan.

9780609605646	On the shores of eternity,poems from Tagore on immortality and beyond	Rabindranath Tagore&Deepak Chopra		To realize that death is an illusion, you either have to be very sophisticated or very simple. Tagore was both. I am awed by his use of language, pure crystals of wise innocence. Every word is personal, every word is universal. Those who met Tagore during his eighty years described him as one of the greatest souls of our age; Einstein considered him a sage. From what we learn in these poems, he certainly lived his own words. He kissed the infinite, he was not afraid to lose everything. And in this book, he allows us to approach death not with dusty words but with a silence that washes the soul. --From the Introduction by Deepak Chopra In this hauntingly beautiful volume, Deepak Chopra presents new English versions of poems by Bengali poet Rabindranath Tagore, a lifelong source of inspiration for Chopra and the first Asian to win the Nobel Prize for Literature. When Tagore writes, "Death, my death / Whisper to me! / For you alone have I kept watch day after day," romantic ecstasy surges through every word. For Tagore the soul was more real than any object, and he sang of death as a joyful voyage home to the eternity from which we sprang. In these poems we experience a dramatic alternative to the fearful Western view of death. Through the magic of Tagore's lyricism we begin to understand that by becoming familiar with death, and watching it grow closer, we can come to live fully in the present moment. As Tagore tells us so eloquently, "If you weep because the sun has gone out / Your tears may blind you to the stars."	1999-11-16	Harmony Books						ZZZ000000

It's up 165% since then, with more than $200 million invested, and it's the single-best performing index fund in the world in any asset class.

9780375506710	The march,a novel	E. L. Doctorow		In 1864, after Union general William Tecumseh Sherman burned Atlanta, he marched his sixty thousand troops east through Georgia to the sea, and then up into the Carolinas. The army fought off Confederate forces and lived off the land, pillaging the Southern plantations, taking cattle and crops for their own, demolishing cities, and accumulating a borne-along population of freed blacks and white refugees until all that remained was the dangerous transient life of the uprooted, the dispossessed, and the triumphant. Only a master novelist could so powerfully and compassionately render the lives of those who marched. The author of Ragtime, City of God, and The Book of Daniel has given us a magisterial work with an enormous cast of unforgettable characters - white and black, men, women, and children, unionists and rebels, generals and privates, freed slaves and slave owners. At the center is General Sherman himself; a beautiful freed slave girl named Pearl; a Union regimental surgeon, Colonel Sartorius; Emily Thompson, the dispossessed daughter of a Southern judge; and Arly and Will, two misfit soldiers. Almost hypnotic in its narrative drive, The March stunningly renders the countless lives swept up in the violence of a country at war with itself. The great march in E. L. Doctorow's hands becomes something more - a floating world, a nomadic consciousness, and an unforgettable reading experience with awesome relevance to our own times.	2005	Random House						ZZZ000000
9781586420932	No end to the journey,a novel	Subramanian Shankar		In the distinguished tradition of R. K. Narayan and Anita Desai, S. Shankar has written a keenly observed novel in which comic delicacy and rueful irony are beautifully balanced in a story placed against the vibrant backdrop of the New India, the world's largest democracy, and a country in which the rigid dogmas of the past often clash with the impatient and dynamic innovations of the present. Gopalakrishnan (Gopu to his family and friends), a 65-year-old retired civil servant, has recently and reluctantly returned home to the southern Indian village of Paavalampatti after a forty-year career in New Delhi. His father is dead, and his mother aging and unwell wants her son to take care of her in her dotage. His wife, Parvati, is none too happy to be back. Their only child, Suresh, has stayed behind in New Delhi to oversee a presumably successful construction business. When Suresh unexpectedly comes home, ostensibly to commemorate Dilwali, the Indian Festival of Lights, the fractures that have long existed beneath the surface of the family are suddenly thrust into sharp relief, and Gopalakrishnan finds that he must act as patriarch under difficult circumstances. S. Shankar has conjured a marvelous portrait of family and place. His touch is deft, his portrayals of characters succinct and empathetic, his evocation of the tensions that roil the surface of the New India persuasive but never overstated, and his depiction of family universal.	2005-10-04	Steerforth Press						ZZZ000000

9780812973822	The big picture,money and power in Hollywood	Edward Jay Epstein		During the heyday of the studio system spanning the 1930s, '40s, and '50s, virtually all the American motion picture industry's money, power, and prestige came from a single activity: selling tickets at the box office. Today, the movie business is just a small, highly visible outpost in a media universe controlled by six corporations-Sony, Time Warner, NBC Universal, Viacom, Disney, and NewsCorporation. These conglomerates view films as part of an immense, synergistic, vertically integrated money-making industry. In "The Big Picture, acclaimed writer Edward Jay Epstein gives an unprecedented, sweeping, and thoroughly entertaining account of the real magic behind moviemaking: how the studios make their money. Epstein shows how, in Hollywood, the only art that matters is the art of the deal: major films turn huge profits, not from the movies themselves but through myriad other enterprises, such as video-game spin-offs, fast-food tie-ins, soundtracks, and even theme-park rides. The studios may compete with one another for stars, publicity, box-office receipts, and Oscars; their corporate parents, however, make fortunes from cooperation (and collusion) with one another in less glamorous markets, such as cable, home video, and pay-TV. But money is only part of the Hollywood story; the social and political milieus-power, prestige, and status-tell the rest. Alongside remarkable financial revelations, The Big Picture is filled with eye-opening true Hollywood insider stories. We learn how the promise of free cowboy boots for a producer delayed a major movie's shooting schedule; why stars never perform their own stunts, despite what the supermarket tabloids claim; how moviesintentionally shape political sensibilities, both in America and abroad; and why fifteen-year-olds dictate the kind of low-grade fare that has flooded screens across the country. Epstein also offers incisive profiles of the pioneers, including Louis B. Mayer, who helped build Hollywood, and introduces us to the visionaries-Walt Disney, Akio Morita, Rupert Murdoch, Steve Ross, Sumner Redstone, David Sarnoff-power brokers who, by dint of innovation and deception, created and control the media that mold our lives. If you are interested in Hollywood today and the complex and fascinating way it has evolved in order to survive, you haven't seen the big picture until you've read "The Big Picture.

9780394536491	The castle in the forest,a novel	Norman Mailer		No career in modern American letters is at once so brilliant, varied, and controversial as that of Norman Mailer. In a span of more than six decades, Mailer has searched into subjects ranging from World War II to Ancient Egypt, from the march on the Pentagon to Marilyn Monroe, from Henry Miller and Mohammad Ali to Jesus Christ. Now, inThe Castle in the Forest,his first major work of fiction in more than a decade, Mailer offers what may be his consummate literary endeavor: He has set out to explore the evil of Adolf Hitler. The narrator, a mysterious SS man who is later revealed to be an exceptional presence, gives us young Adolf from birth, as well as Hitler's father and mother, his sisters and brothers, and the intimate details of his childhood and adolescence. A tapestry of unforgettable characters,The Castle in the Forestdelivers its playful twists and surprises with astonishing insight into the nature of the struggle between good and evil that exists in us all. At its core is a hypothesis that propels this novel and makes it a work of stunning originality. Now, on the eve of his eighty-fourth birthday, Norman Mailer may well be saying more than he ever has before.	2007	Random House						ZZZ000000

9781400063246	For love of politics,Bill and Hillary Clinton : the White House years	Sally Bedell Smith		During their eight years in the White House, Bill and Hillary Clinton worked together more closely than the public ever knew. Their intertwined personal and professional lives had far-reaching consequencesfor politics, domestic policy, and international affairsand their marital troubles became a national soap opera. Based on unparalleled access to scores of Clinton insiderscabinet officers, top administration officials, close personal friendsand skilled analysis of a vast written record, including previously unavailable private papers,For Love of Politicsis the first book to explain the dynamics of Bill and Hillary's relationship, showing that they are two halves of a unique whole and that it is impossible to understand one Clinton without factoring in the other. Sally Bedell Smith, acclaimed author ofGrace and Power: The Private World of the Kennedy White House,offers intimate scenes from the Clinton marriage, with new details and insights into how a passion for politics sustained Bill and Hillary through one crisis after another. With clarity and depth, Smith examines the origins of an unconventional copresidency, explains the impact of the Clintons' tensions as well as their talents, and reveals how Hillary shifted from openly exercising power in the first two years to acting as a "hidden hand," advising her husband on a range of foreign and domestic issues as well as decisions on hiring and firing. Smith describes for the first time the inner workings of a White House with an unprecedented "three forces to be reckoned with"Bill, Hillary, and Al Goreand shows how the First Lady's rivalry with the Vice President played out in the West Wing and even more profoundly during the 2000 campaign. As Hillary seeks to follow in her husband's footsteps, this riveting book will leave readers marveling at what they never knew about Bill's intensely covered presidencyand wondering what it would be like to have two presidents, both named Clinton, living in the White House.

9780385518192	The other Islam,Sufism and the road to global harmony	Stephen Schwartz		This eye-opening, insightful exploration of Sufism, the spiritual tradition that has supported Islam for more than a thousand years, shows why it offers a promising foundation for reconciliation between the Western and Muslim worlds. Many Americans today identify Islam with maniacal hatred of the West.The Other Islamtransforms this image and opens the way to finding common ground in our troubled times. Sufism, a blend of the mystical and rational tendencies within Islam, emerged soon after the revelation of Muhammad. A reforming movement against the increasing worldliness of Muslim society, it focuses on Islam's spiritual dimension. Described as "Islam of the Heart," Sufism has attracted adherents among both Sunni and Shi'a Muslims, as well as Jews, Christians, Hindus, and Buddhists. InThe Other Islam, Stephen Schwartz traces the origins and history of Sufism, elucidates its teachings, and illustrates its links to the other religions. He comments on such celebrated Sufi poets and philosophers as Rumi and Al-Ghazali, and narrates their influence on the Kabbalah, on the descendants of the Jewish philosopher Maimonides, and on Christian mystics like Saint John of the Cross and Saint Teresa of Avila as well as the American transcendentalists. Furthermore, Schwartz presents a fresh survey of Sufism in today's Islamic world, anticipating an intellectual renaissance of the faith and alternatives to fundamentalism and tyranny in Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and Iran.	2008-09-16	Doubleday						ZZZ000000

The book includes practitioners of all genres and writers of every literary type: Nobel Prize-winners and thriller writers; memoirists and story-tellers; writers of romance and serious non-fiction. The book advocates the idea that great writing can be found in every category so we should listen to what writers in all fields have to say and learn from them. From the perspective of these writers, the book addresses each part of the writing process. Writers talk about how they find their inspiration and who has influenced them. They describe how they got started (Nora Roberts was marooned at home with her children in a snowstorm when she put pen to paper) and how they found time and space to pursue their dream. There is space for grammar and style (Why does everyone talk about Ernest Hemingway when they mention style?) and the development of a writing technique. The Mentor includes writers of journalism, plays, poems, and screenplays and also how you can deal with publishers and agents if you want to try to make a living writing. The only thing the writers here have in common is their success: Included are John le Carre and Patricia Highsmith; Stephen King and Terry Brooks; Tennessee Williams and Toni Morrison; Willa Cather and E.B. White; William Faulkner and Donna Tartt; Alice McDermott and Joyce Carol Oates; J.K. Rowling and J.R.R. Tolkein; Charles Dickens and Edgar Allan Poe; Irvine Welsh and Michael Chabon; Michael Connelly and Elmore Leonard.

9780517160626	Leonardo	Trewin Copplestone		LEONARDO (1452-1519), along with Michelangelo and Raphael, is one of the greatest representative figures of the Italian Renaissance and is acknowledged to be perhaps the most complete universal genius in history as artist, scientist, engineer and inventor.His painting, the Mona Lisa, is arguably both the most famous painting in the world and the quintessential Renaissance image of womanhood. So extensive and wide-ranging are his achievements that although this book is a study of Leonardo as an artist, it would be misleading not to include some consideration of the whole remarkable spectrum of his life.There are no clues to the origin of his genius in his modest family background. The illegitimate son of a local village notary, the young Leonardo demonstrated a developing artistic talent which led to his being apprenticed to the Florentine painter Andrea del Verrocchio, thus beginning his career as a painter before his intellectual curiosity led him to more practical professional pursuits. As a result his oeuvre where painting is concerned is remarkably limited and much disputed by art historians.Nevertheless, he left a unique legacy to the world which encompassed the entire creative impetus and spiritual dynamic of the Italian Renaissance.	1998-09-09	Gramercy						ZZZ000000

9780517160664	Edgar Degas	Trewin Copplestone		EDGAR DEGAS (1834-1917) became a professional painter through a change in his family's fortunes. He grew up the privileged son of wealthy and cultured parents and despite his interest in art was destined for a career in law until the failure of the family bank.More than any of his famous contemporaries, while possibly excluding Manet, Degas was a traditionalist painter. He was dismissive of the Impressionist technique as a method, although he participated in most of the group's early exhibitions. As a result, he is more closely allied in popular understanding with Impressionism than he himself ever wished to be. Best known for his paintings of ballet Dancers, Degas was an urbane and savagely witty man, choosing his subjects from the cultured society life of Paris in which he was a well known figure.	1998-09-09	Gramercy						ZZZ000000

9780060014179	Child No More,A Memoir	Xaviera Hollander		In the early 1970s -- between the dawn of the sexual revolution and the disillusionment of Watergate -- a young Dutch woman named Xaviera de Vries was transformed overnight into an international celebrity and sex symbol as the author of The Happy Hooker, her racy chronicle of life as a high-class New York madam. As Xaviera Hollander, she became the voice of that era's new sexual freedoms even as her book was banned and she herself was deported to Amsterdam in the wake of the scandal. Yet sexual escapades have formed only a small part of this woman's remarkable life story -- a story she reveals for the first time in this thoughtful and involving memoir.It was a life begun in terror. Two months after her birth, Hollander and her mother were confined in a women's prison camp during the WWII Japanese occupation of Indonesia; her father, a doctor, was imprisoned nearby. By some miracle, the small family survived; yet the horrors of their treatment -- and the precious nature of their bond -- were imprinted forever on her psyche.From her childhood forward, Hollander traces her life, and sexuality, as it was shaped by the example of her parents: her father, a dapper and witty Jewish psychologist and intellectual, her mother, the gorgeous daughter of conventional German parents. With characteristic frankness, Hollander revisits how her parents' tempestuous marriage shaped the course of her own life. And as she chronicles her eventual departure for New York, her passionate affairs with men and women, and her years of international celebrity, she reveals how her parents' lives continued to entwine with her own -- the romantic ideal of her father coloring her relationships with men, her jealousy of her mother settling at last into a warm and abiding love.Told in the utterly honest and unquenchably inquisitive voice that has always distinguished her, Xaviera Hollander's Child No More recounts a surprising and ultimately uplifting voyage of discovery through three lives.	2002-05-23	HarperCollins						ZZZ000000

9780060846879	The Bush agenda,invading the world, one economy at a time	Antonia Juhasz		The Bush Agenda is the first book to expose the Bush Administration's radical economic agenda for global domination, a plan more extreme, unilateral and audacious than any of his predecessors, a plan that has created the greatest level of violent opposition to America and Americans in recent history.   The Bush Agenda: Invading the World, One Economy at a Time explores the Bush Administration's plan to invade the world through a corporate globalization agenda, first in Iraq, then the Middle East with the proposed U.S.-Middle East Free Trade Area, and ultimately as a cornerstone to the global Bush Doctrine of Pax Americana. What is Bush's "free trade?" It's an economic model that argues that by removing restrictions on multinational corporations, these companies will be freed to become engines of economic growth in countries around the world, but in fact bring vast wealth of a small number of global elites while entire populations suffer dislocation, poverty and violence, creating a perfect Petri dish for breeding terrorists. The instruments for this takeover include such corporations as Bechtel, Lockheed Martin, ChevronTexaco, Halliburton, and many others.   This book addresses the history of U.S. economic relations throughout the world over the past 25 years, the key role of U.S. corporations, and the larger Bush economic agenda and what the potential impact of this agenda will be on the United States and the world. It concludes with specific alternatives to guide the U.S. on a more peaceful and sustainable course in the future. Using Naomi Klein's No Logo and Eric Schlosser's Fast Food Nation as models, The Bush Agenda is based on hard analytic fact and presented so that it will not only be persuasive, but highly engaging and entertaining to a broad audience.	2006	ReganBooks						ZZZ000000

9781846041112	The third Jesus,how to find truth and love in today's world	Deepak Chopra		In this dazzling new book, one of the most influential spiritual thinkers of our time provides an answer that is as challenging as it is uplifting. Deepak Chopra searches for the Christ who stands at the heart of Christianity and discovers the identity of Jesus is threefold. Firstly, there is Jesus the man, who lived over 2000 years ago and whose sermons form the foundation of Christian theology. Secondly, there is Jesus the Son of God, who represents a specific branch of religion. Finally, there is the Third Jesus, the spiritual guide whose teachings embrace humanity as a whole. By considering each of these separate figures, Chopra allows us to decide for ourselves which of them speaks the most clearly to us today. As we become familiar with the universal wisdom of Christ, most especially through the guidance of the Third Jesus, we may become more open to a truly loving spirituality. And we will begin to create a brighter future, free from hatred fuelled by religious fundamentalism.	2008-02-21	Rider						ZZZ000000

9782940361267	Sticky graphics,create memorable graphic design using mnemonics and visual hooks	Carolyn Knight&Jessica Glaser		Memories do not necessarily have any association with good or bad design, but simply with devices that stay in the mind's eye. Good design is often memorable, but not always mnemonically, in that it cannot be described, or recreated with any assured accuracy. Viewers may have a recollection of its pleasing nature, but have little recall as to precisely why this is. If "red top" newspaper mastheads, the McDonalds golden arches, the Nike logo or the Heinz baked beans label are considered typical of successful mnemonic devices, it is interesting to debate their aesthetic merits. Sticky Graphics evaluates the audience's role in responding to mnemonic devices by discussing the impact of such influences as experience, familiarity and uniqueness. For example, designs that feature a viewer's favorite color, shape, or significant topic are likely to trigger a more positive and productive memory. Defined as the art of assisting memory, mnemonics play an essential and often unsung role in successful graphics. Sticky Graphics concentrates on the mnemonics of graphic design, and focuses on design memory devices. Presenting methods and solutions for ensuring audience retention and recollection though and examination of Typography, Graphic Wit and Shock, Metaphor Language, Use of Scale, Color Image, Materials, and Composition as well as insight into smell, sound, and touch.	2006-11-01	RotoVision						ZZZ000000

9780415141178	An outline of philosophy	Bertrand Russell		Philosophy, Russell argues in An Outline of Philosophy, is concerned with the universe as a whole. Humanity demands consideration solely as the instrument by which we acquire knowledge of the universe. Russell illuminates the ways in which we are capable of knowledge and discovering natural laws with a discussion of perception, memory, learning in infants and animals and linguistic ability. He moves on to a study of the physical world and then to a discussion of humanity as it sees itself. Finally Russell considers some of the great philosophers of the past and what philosophy has to say about humanity's place in the universe.	1995	Routledge						ZZZ000000

The issues of student assessment, course evaluation and quality audit are also examined. The following issues are considered in detail: the theory and practice of distance and open education; instructional design, with particular reference to the ways in which an understanding of science may be acquired; the use of remote learning for science education; the strengths of individual instructional media; methods of addressing the problems of practical work for remote learners; the design of multi-media courses; and the evaluation of educational effectiveness.

Today, despite our ability to manufacture synthetics, gemstones still hold their appeal. Victoria Finlay investigates why in her extraordinary journey to uncover the hidden world of precious stones. The starting point is a sapphire given to her by her parents that was harvested, not by a miner as she had imagined but by men in muddy loincloths trawling a warm stream in Sri Lanka. The extraordinary travels in JEWELS: A SECRET HISTORY take her cycling along the Baltic Amber Route, down the emerald mines of Afghanistan. As we learn from a ruby trader in Burma, the more precious a jewel, the greater the human cost of acquiring it, and JEWELS: A SECRET HISTORY also explores the human histories of gemstones.

Victoria Finlay's unique blending of travelogue and narrative history ensures that this book, the first for the general reader, will be as unforgettable as the stones themselves.	2007-01-31	Sceptre						ZZZ000000

9780340896402	Delizia!,the epic history of the italians and their food	John Dickie		Everyone loves Italian food. But how did the Italians come to eat so well? The advertising industry tells us the answer lies in the vineyards and olive groves of Tuscany - among sun-weathered peasants, and mammas serving pasta under the pergola Yet this nostalgic fantasy has little to do with the real history of Italian cuisine. Because Italian food is city food. And telling its story means telling the story of the Italians as a people of city dwellers. For a thousand years, Italy's cities have been magnets for everything that makes for great eating: ingredients, talent, money, and power. In DELIZIA! the author of the acclaimed COSA NOSTRA takes a revelatory historical journey through the flavours of Italy's cities. From the bustle of Medieval Milan, to the bombast of Fascist Rome; from the pleasure gardens of Renaissance Ferrara, to the putrid alleyways of nineteenth-century Naples. In rich slices of urban life, DELIZIA! shows how violence and intrigue, as well as taste and creativity, went to make the world's favourite cuisine. With its mix of vivid story-telling, ground-breaking research and shrewd analysis, John Dickie's DELIZIA! is as appetising as the dishes it describes.	2007-08-09	Hodder General Publishing Division						ZZZ000000

9781416553649	Born standing up,a comic's life	Steve Martin		In the midseventies, Steve Martin exploded onto the comedy scene. By 1978 he was the biggest concert draw in the history of stand-up. In 1981 he quit forever. This book is, in his own words, the story of "why I did stand-up and why I walked away." Emmy and Grammy Award winner, author of the acclaimed New York Times bestsellers Shopgirl and The Pleasure of My Company, and a regular contributor to The New Yorker, Martin has always been awriter. His memoir of his years in stand-up is candid, spectacularly amusing, and beautifully written. At age ten Martin started his career at Disneyland, selling guidebooks in the newly opened theme park. In the decade that followed, he worked in the Disney magic shop and the Bird Cage Theatre at Knott's Berry Farm, performing his first magic/comedy act a dozen times a week. The story of these years, during which he practiced and honed his craft, is moving and revelatory. The dedication to excellence and innovation is formed at an astonishingly early age and never wavers or wanes. Martin illuminates the sacrifice, discipline, and originality that made him an icon and informs his work to this day. To be this good, to perform so frequently, was isolating and lonely. It took Martin decades to reconnect with his parents and sister, and he tells that story with great tenderness. Martin also paints a portrait of his times -- the era of free love and protests against the war in Vietnam, the heady irreverence of The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour in the late sixties, and the transformative new voice of Saturday Night Live in the seventies. Throughout the text, Martin has placed photographs, many never seen before. Born Standing Up is a superb testament to the sheer tenacity, focus, and daring of one of the greatest and most iconoclastic comedians of all time.	2007-11-20	Scribner						ZZZ000000

9780770428143	The Mars Mystery	Graham Hancock		An asteroid transformed Mars from a lush planet with rivers and oceans into a bleak and icy hell. Is Earth condemned to the same fate, or can we protect ourselves and our planet from extinction? In his most riveting and revealing book yet, Graham Hancock examines the evidence that the barren Red Planet was once home to a lush environment of flowing rivers, lakes, and oceans. Could Mars have sustained life and civilization? Megaliths found on the parched shores of Cydonia, a former Martian ocean, mirror the geometrical conventions of the pyramids at Egypt's Giza necropolis. Especially startling is a Sphinx-like structure depicting a face with distinguishable diadem, teeth, mouth and an Egyptian-style headdress. Might there be a connection between the structures of Egypt and those of Mars? Why does NASA continue to dismiss these remarkable anomalies as "a trick of light"? Hancock points to the intriguing possibility that ancient Martian civilization is communicating with us through the remarkable structures it left behind. In exploring the possible traces left by the Martian civilization and the cosmic cataclysm that may have ended it,The Mars Mysteryis both an illumination of our ancient past and a warning--that we still have time to heed--about our ultimate fate.	1999-03-16	Seal Books						ZZZ000000

9781852427481	Psychotic reactions and carburetor dung	Lester Bangs&Greil Marcus		Lester Bangs was a celebrity within the world of rock 'n' roll from the early '70's to his death in 1982. A musician himself, he was driven by his love for the music and contempt for all pretension. He was a prolific and hugely gifted writer, as much part of the scene as he was a writer about it. This book covers a vast range of music from Presley, through the Animals and the Yardbirds, on to Lennon, Lou Reed, Iggy Pop and finally the Ramones, Sex Pistols and the whole burgeoning New York punk scene of the early 1980's.	2001-08-02	Serpent's Tail						ZZZ000000

9781852428822	A time for machetes,the Rwandan genocide : the killers speak : a report	Jean Hatzfeld		In April-May 1994 in Rwanda, 800,000 Rwandan Tutsis were massacred by their Hutu fellow citizens - more than 10,000 a day, mostly being hacked to death by machete. Jean Hatzfeld reports on the results of his interviews with nine of the Hutu killers, all of whom are now in prison, some awaiting execution. Hatzfeld elicits extraordinary testimony from these men about the genocide they perpetrated. Each describes what it was like the first time he killed someone, what he felt like when he killed a mother and child, and how he reacted when he killed a cordial acquaintance. Each reflects on his feelings of moral responsibility, his guilt, remorse, or indifference to the crimes.Since the Holocaust, it has been conventional to presume that only depraved and monstrous evil incarnate could perpetrate such crimes, but it may be, Hatzfeld suggests, that such actions are within the realm of ordinary human conduct. To read this disturbing, enlightening and very brave book is to consider the foundation of human morality and ethics in a new light.	2005-09-08	Serpent's Tail						ZZZ000000
9781852427610	Pandora's Handbag,Adventures in the Book World	Elizabeth Young		Born into a Calvinist Scottish family, Elizabeth Young's life was turned upside down when she was given, at the age of 11, three American novels: Algren's The Man with the Golden Arm, Ginsberg's Howl and Kerouac's On the Road. An exceptionally ghoulish child, obsessed with graveyards, wolves and horror stories, she very early on decided to devote her life to books. Elizabeth Young's collected writings exhibit her singular attraction to the bizarre and her dedication to the high standards of a critic. Witty, incisive, wide-ranging and moving, Pandora's Handbag chronicles the journey of a modern arts critic and Young's personal journey from childhood to critic. Each previously published article is presented in its entirety, with original titles and additional notes. This collection includes two of Young's crusading articles (on Drug Legislation and the Hepatitis C virus), which have become seminal texts.	2003-03-13	Serpent's Tail						ZZZ000000
9781852427887	One Hundred Strokes of the Brush Before Bed	Melissa P.		One very hot Italian summer, a schoolgirl sits alone in her bedroom, staring at posters of Marlene Dietrich and listening to classical music. She strips before her mirror, examining her adolescent body pleasurably, yet without desire. She writes: 'I want love, diary. I want to feel my heart melt, to see the stalactites of my ice shatter and sink in the river of passion, of beauty.' The narrator searches for love but the men she meets only want sex. With the pain of unrequited love comes the excitement caused by her discovery of the sexual power she has over men (and other women). This diary of a teenage girl's sex life is a work of deceptive innocence. Influenced by Nabokov and Anais Nin, it is both erotic and literary. When the book was first published, it was assumed that this could not be the work of a teenager. In fact it is the first novel of a young writer of great literary talent.	2007	Serpent's Tail						FIC005000
9781852424619	House Rules	Heather Lewis		Fifteen-year-old Lee has just been expelled from boarding school. Unwilling to go home to her abusive father, she escapes to the horse-show circuit and begins an affair with a beautiful but dangerous rider named Tory Markham. Through Tory, she becomes involved with a disreputable team of brother and sister trainers: Carl, notorious for his ruthless training methods, and Linda, who keeps the stable - both the horses and the riders - doped on narcotics. Lee's descent into a web of violent sex and heroin addiction is depicted with hellishly vivid precision. First published in 1995, House Rules established Heather Lewis' reputation as a gifted and uncompromising writer.	2005-06-01	Serpent's Tail						ZZZ000000
9781852428952	Tarantula	Thierry Jonquet		Richard Lafargue is an eminent plastic surgeon haunted by dirty secrets. He has an operating theatre in the basement of his chateau and keeps his partner Eve imprisoned in her bedroom, a room he has equipped with an intercom and 300-watt speakers through which he bellows orders. Eve is only allowed out to be paraded at cocktail parties and on the last Sunday of each month, when the couple visit a young woman in a mental asylum. Following these outings, Lafargue humiliates Eve by forcing her to perform lewd sexual acts with strangers while he watches through a one-way mirror.In alternating chapters, Jonquet introduces seemingly unrelated characters - a criminal on the run after murdering a policeman, and an abducted young man who finds himself chained naked in a dark chamber, forced to endure all manner of physical torture at the hands of a mysterious stranger, whom he calls 'Mygale', after a type of tropical spider. All of these characters are caught in a deceitful web, doomed to meet their fate.	2005-11-10	Serpent's Tail						ZZZ000000
9781852428631	The blind rider	Juan Goytisolo		In this novel, which Juan Goytisolo has said will be his last, a melancholy, angry old man reviews the precious moments of his life amid the disasters of contemporary history. Years of love end with the death of his wife: their flat, furniture and CDs go, even memories fade. He remembers tender moments with his mother, who was killed in a bomb-blast unleashed by Fascists on Barcelona, the town he was born in. Together they would look at the stars and identify the brightest constellations. For the narrator, the ideal writer is Tolstoy, an enlightened artistocrat who wished to free his serfs and bring up his children with progressive, humanist principles. Tolstoy's characters embody dreams of a more intense, varied life: through them, the narrator discovers that freedom only exists in books. Like the books of W.G.Sebald and Italo Calvino, Blind Rider is a fictional memoir that spans a history of the last fifty years. Tender at a personal level, it is at a political level an angry rant at God's lack of humanity: it confirms Goytisolo's position as one of the most committed writers of our time.	2005-10-13	Serpent's Tail						ZZZ000000
9781852429171	Future Tense,The Coming World Order	Gwynne Dyer		The foundations of World War III are being laid today - this is the central message of Future: Tense. The whole world needs America to lose the war in Iraq as soon as possible, lest the stand-off between Islamists and American neo-conservatives escalates into a new global conflict. The terrorist threat is a red herring, and the radical Islamists' dream of a worldwide jihad against the West is a fantasy, but Washington's attempt to revive Pax Americana - its dream of global military dominance - is real.In this lucid, compelling book, a brilliant follow-up to his bestselling Ignorant Armies, Gwynne Dyer analyzes the history of tensions between the Arab world and the West, and shows how fringe groups of extremists on both sides now feed off each other: terrorism in Western cities provides justification for military reprisals, which in turn strengthen the cause of Islamist fanatics. Dyer argues that unless America honours its commitment to the United Nations, the rule of law and multilateralism, then the drift back into alliances and military confrontations will begin, and the world will edge toward the brink of disaster.	2006-04-23	Serpent's Tail						ZZZ000000

Juxtaposing philosophical asides and travelling deep inside the most forbidden corners of male desire, Nic Kelman's insights are both revealing and shocking.	2006-04-04	Serpent's Tail						ZZZ000000
9781852429027	Greed	Elfriede Jelinek		Kurt Janisch is an ambitious, but frustrated country policeman. Things are not going right in his life - at least not fast enough. But a country policeman gets talking to a lot of people in the line of duty - particularly women. Lonely, middle-aged women, women with a bit of property perhaps... Matters go from bad to worse: for Kurt Janisch, for the women who fall for him. Someone sees too much, knows too much. Soon there's a body in a lake and a murderer to be caught.A thriller set amid the mountains and small towns of southern Austria, Greed is Elfriede Jelinek's most accessible novel since The Piano Teacher. But as always Jelinek gives the reader a lot more to think about: the ecological costs of affluence, the inescapable burden and inadequacy of our everyday words, the exploitative nature of relations between men and women, the impossibility of life without relationships. A meditative reflection on ageing, Greed is another chapter in Jelinek's chronicling of her love/hate relationship with Austria.	2006-10	Serpent's Tail						ZZZ000000
9781852429317	Fortunate son	Walter Mosley		In spite of remarkable differences, Eric and Tommy are as close as brothers. Eric, a Nordic Adonis, is graced by a seemingly endless supply of good fortune, Tommy is a sickly black boy, cursed with health problems, who yet remains optimistic and strong.After tragedy rips this makeshift family apart, the lives of these boys diverge astonishingly: Eric, the golden youth, is given everything but trusts nothing; Tommy, motherless and impoverished, has nothing, but feels lucky every day of his life. In a riveting story of modern-day resilience and redemption, the two confront separate challenges, and when circumstances reunite them years later, they draw on their extraordinary natures to confront a common enemy and, ultimately, save lives.Fortunate Son has the same brilliant observations of the hidden currents of modern life that won great praise for The Man in My Basement.

9781852424756	Three to Kill	Jean-Patrick Manchette		Businessman Georges Gerfaut witnesses a murder-and is pursued by the killers. His conventional life knocked off the rails, Gerfaut turns the tables and sets out to track down his pursuers. Along the way, he learns a thing or two about himself.... Manchette-masterful stylist, ironist, and social critic-limns the cramped lives of professionals in a neo-conservative world. Jean-Patrick Manchette (1942-1995) rescued the French crime novel from the grip of stodgy police procedurals-restoring the noir edge by virtue of his post-1968 leftism. Today, Manchette is a totem to the generation of French mystery writers who came in his wake. Jazz saxophonist, political activist, and screen writer, Manchette was influenced as much by Guy Debord as by Gustave Flaubert.	2007-02-02	Serpent's Tail						FIC022000

She had no idea that her life-changing travels would have both in spades -- as well as danger and intrigue -- when she catches the eye of ship owner Boyd Anderson and inadvertently stumbles upon a high-stakes kidnapping.When Sir Anthony Malory's young daughter is abducted from London's Hyde Park, her kidnapper mistakenly sends the ransom note to the home of Sir Anthony's brother, James. With James and his wife, Georgina, in the Caribbean, the demands are received by their houseguest -- Georgina's youngest brother, Boyd Anderson. Searching for the girl with Anthony, the notoriously hot-headed American sea captain fully intends to make the foolhardy villain pay. But he hardly expects to find exquisite Katey Tyler, recently a passenger on his ship, at the center of the plot!Little does Katey realize that in having caught the attention of Boyd Anderson -- and in meeting up with the Malorys -- she's about to experience more excitement than the typical young lady encounters on a grand tour, and her life will never be dull again. A multitude of surprises await Katey, from the startling truth about her mother's early life to the lengths a man will go to win the affections of a lady who has every reason to despise him -- but who can't resist the seductive, impassioned love he has to offer her.With the delightful humor, lovable characters, and tempestuous passions that have placed Johanna Lindsey's eight previous Malory novels among the best-loved and most widely read romantic novels of our time,No Choice But Seductionsweeps readers away on an irresistible adventure that is as bold and charming as the heroine at its heart.	2008-06-17	Simon & Schuster						FIC027070

9781416576556	Where Are You Now?	Mary Higgins Clark		From America's Queen of Suspense comes a gripping tale of a young woman trying to unravel the mystery of a family tragedy -- a quest with terrifying repercussions.It has been ten years since twenty-one-year-old Charles MacKenzie Jr. ("Mack") went missing. A Columbia University senior, about to graduate and already accepted at Duke University Law School, he walked out of his apartment on Manhattan's Upper West Side and has never been seen again. However, he does make one ritual phone call to his mother every year: on Mother's Day. Each time, he assures her he is fine, refuses to answer her frantic questions, then hangs up. Even the death of his father in the tragedy of 9/11 does not bring him home nor break the pattern of his calls.Mack's sister, Carolyn, is now twenty-six, a law school graduate, and has just finished her clerkship for a civil court judge in Manhattan. She has endured two family tragedies, yet she realizes that she will never be able to have closure and get on with her life until she finds her brother. So this year when Mack makes his annual Mother's Day call, Carolyn interrupts to announce her intention to track him down, no matter what it takes. The next morning after Mass, her uncle, Monsignor Devon MacKenzie, receives a scrawled message left in the collection basket: "Uncle Devon, tell Carolyn she must not look for me."Mack's cryptic warning does nothing to deter his sister from taking up the search. Carolyn's pursuit of the truth about Mack's disappearance swiftly plunges her into a world of unexpected danger and unanswered questions. What is the secret that the superintendents of the building in which Mack was living have to hide? What do Mack's old roommates, the charismatic club owner Nick DeMarco and the cold and wealthy real estate tycoon Bruce Galbraith, know about Mack's disappearance? Is Nick connected to the disappearance of Leesey Andrews, who had last been seen in his trendy club? Can the police possibly believe that Mack is not only alive, but a serial killer, a shadowy predator of young women?Carolyn's passionate search for the truth about her brother -- and for her brother himself -- leads her into a deadly confrontation with someone close to her whose secret he cannot allow her to reveal.	2008-04-08	Simon & Schuster						ZZZ000000

9780743204163	Winning with the market,beat the traders and brokers in good times and bad	Douglas R. Sease		Say good-bye to expensive brokers! Forget gambling on their latest "hot stock," or their junk-bond or high-cost mutual funds recommendations. The results can be disastrous. Instead, veteran Wall Street Journal editor and CNBC commentator Douglas R. Sease shows you how to take back control of your money with a simple, safe, yet powerful investment program that can be tailored to your individual needs. Writing with the solid backing of The Wall Street Journal, Doug Sease reminds us that many financial services providers try to make investing appear mysterious and difficult in order to justify their fees. They can sometimes draw you into feverish attempts to beat the market with the promise of huge profits, but that approach to investing can be an almost certain guarantee of failure. The truth is that you can use a combination of inexpensive, easy-to-purchase investment vehicles -- stock-index mutual funds and inflation-indexed Treasury bonds -- to build a portfolio that will maximize your returns and minimize your risk. The low-cost market-matching performance of stock funds becomes the growth engine of your portfolio, while the bonds' steady, assured returns temper the stock market's volatility. In fact, combining a disciplined savings program with an equally disciplined investment program is a virtual guarantee of success. It puts more money into your investments instead of into Wall Street's pockets, and it gives you more of that most precious commodity: your time. As one of the book's many special features, it provides interactive tools for readers to use to plan their finanical futures at winning.wsj.com. Best of all, Sease offers several chapters filled with portfolio recommendations that you can adapt for your own use, depending on your income, age, financial goals, and risk tolerance. He also includes specific information about portfolio-building throughout the book to show you how to make the most of your money and your time at each stage of your working life. Winning with the Market is the only book to offer this indispensable aid -- and the only book you need for a lifetime of successful, broker-free investing.	2001-02-05	Simon & Schuster						ZZZ000000

9780743264730	Einstein,his life and universe	Walter Isaacson		By the author of the acclaimed bestsellerBenjamin Franklin, this is the first full biography of Albert Einstein since all of his papers have become available.How did his mind work? What made him a genius? Isaacson's biography shows how his scientific imagination sprang from the rebellious nature of his personality. His fascinating story is a testament to the connection between creativity and freedom.Based on newly released personal letters of Einstein, this book explores how an imaginative, impertinent patent clerk -- a struggling father in a difficult marriage who couldn't get a teaching job or a doctorate -- became the mind reader of the creator of the cosmos, the locksmith of the mysteries of the atom and the universe. His success came from questioning conventional wisdom and marveling at mysteries that struck others as mundane. This led him to embrace a morality and politics based on respect for free minds, free spirits, and free individuals.These traits are just as vital for this new century of globalization, in which our success will depend on our creativity, as they were for the beginning of the last century, when Einstein helped usher in the modern age.	2007	Simon & Schuster						ZZZ000000

9780743296519	No excuses,concessions of a serial campaigner	Robert Shrum		He was named by The Atlantic Monthly as "the most sought-after strategist in the Democratic party." He was targeted by National Review as the Democratic Party's "poet goon." From his unique perspective, Robert Shrum gives us an epic and personal story of the struggle for power in America during the past four decades. With wit and humor, rare candor, and a wealth of detail, he vividly recounts the real personalities and real forces that shaped the outcome of the closest and most important elections of our time. We are there with Shrum in the back rooms, on the planes, and in the motorcades with Ted Kennedy, Al Gore, John Kerry, John Edwards, and Bill and Hillary Clinton.Shrum reveals the manipulations and limitations of old and new forms of political persuasion, from the historic and sometimes controversial speeches he wrote to the negative ads he created for national and statewide candidates, from prepping presidential nominees for critical debates to the deployment of the new political weapon, the Internet. He lifts the curtain on decisive moments. Did John Kerry and John Edwards actually believe in the Iraq war they voted for? What was the real reason the Kerry campaign didn't respond faster to the Swift Boat attacks? Why didn't Al Gore let Bill Clinton campaign all-out in 2000? How did Clinton get through the first perilous week of the Lewinsky scandal? This is a provocative journey through recent history: George McGovern's antiwar campaign of 1972, the improbable rise of Jimmy Carter, Senate campaigns that made historic breakthroughs and shaped the presidential contests of the future, the gifts that made Bill Clinton a great politician -- and the circumstances and calculations that kept him from being a great president. As strategist, adviser, and often friend to the leaders he enlisted with, Shrum shows them as they are, with their strengths and human weaknesses -- as well as his own. Assailed as a populist who pushed the Democratic Party, in a phrase he coined, "to stand for the people, not the powerful," Shrum argues that unlike Republicans from Reagan on, Democrats fall short, politically or in office, when they trim their convictions and walk away from fundamental issues -- like universal health coverage.This is one of the most fascinating books ever written about the victories and defeats, the causes and candidates, the "flawed heroes" that drive the high drama of American politics.	2007	Simon & Schuster						ZZZ000000

9781416558804	Beyond the White House,waging peace, fighting disease, building hope	Jimmy Carter		This is the story of President Jimmy Carter's post-presidency, the most admired and productive in the nation's history. Through The Carter Center, which he and Rosalynn Carter founded in 1982, he has fought neglected diseases, waged peace in war zones, and built hope among some of the most forgotten and needy people in the world. Serving in more than seventy nations, Carter has led peacekeeping efforts for Ethiopia, North Korea, Haiti, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Uganda, and Sudan. With his colleagues from The Carter Center, he has monitored more than sixty-five elections in troubled nations, from Palestine to Indonesia.Carter's bold initiatives, undertaken with dedicated colleagues, have eliminated, prevented, or cured an array of diseases that have been characterized as "neglected" by the World Health Organization and that afflict tens of millions of people unnecessarily. The Carter Center has taught millions of African families how to increase the production of food grains, and Rosalynn Carter has led a vigorous war against the stigma of mental illness around the world. "Immersing ourselves among these deprived and suffering people has been a great blessing as it stretched our minds and hearts," Jimmy Carter writes. "The principles of The Carter Center have been the same ones that should characterize our nation, or any individual. They are the beliefs inherent in all the great world religions, including commitments to peace, justice, freedom, humility, forgiveness or an attempt to find accommodation with potential foes, generosity, human rights or fair treatment of others, protection of the environment, and the alleviation of suffering. This is our agenda for the future."	2007	Simon & Schuster						ZZZ000000
9780743294089	The great experiment,the story of ancient empires, modern states, and the quest for a global nation	Strobe Talbott		This dramatic narrative of breathtaking scope and riveting focus puts the "story" back into history. It is the saga of how the most ambitious of big ideas -- that a world made up of many nations can govern itself peacefully -- has played out over the millennia. Humankind's "Great Experiment" goes back to the most ancient of days -- literally to the Garden of Eden -- and into the present, with an eye to the future.Strobe Talbott looks back to the consolidation of tribes into nations -- starting with Israel -- and the absorption of those nations into the empires of Hammurabi, the Pharaohs, Alexander, the Caesars, Charlemagne, Genghis Khan, the Ottomans, and the Hapsburgs, through incessant wars of territory and religion, to modern alliances and the global conflagrations of the twentieth century.He traces the breakthroughs and breakdowns of peace along the way: the Pax Romana, the Treaty of Westphalia, the Concert of Europe, the false start of the League of Nations, the creation of the flawed but indispensable United Nations, the effort to build a "new world order" after the cold war, and America's unique role in modern history as "the master builder" of the international system.Offering an insider's view of how the world is governed today, Talbott interweaves through this epic tale personal insights and experiences and takes us with him behind the scenes and into the presence of world leaders as they square off or cut deals with each other. As an acclaimed journalist, he covered the standoff between the superpowers for more than two decades; as a high-level diplomat, he was in the thick of tumultuous events in the 1990s, when the bipolar equilibrium gave way to chaos in the Balkans, the emergence of a new breed of international terrorist, and America's assertiveness during its "unipolar moment" -- which he sees as the latest, but not the last, stage in the Great Experiment.Talbott concludes with a trenchant critique of the worldview and policies of George W.

9780743293990	Blind fall,a novel	Christopher Rice		From three-time New York Times bestselling author Christopher Rice -- whose novels have been called "bold and ambitious" by The New York Times, "chillingly perverse" by USA Today, and "shocking, sexy...intricate" by Glamour -- comes this startling psychological thriller about an Iraq War vet who seeks redemption and revenge when a fellow Marine he failed to protect during the war is brutally murdered.John Houck became a Marine to become a hero. But his life changed when he failed to notice an explosive device that ended up maiming the captain of his Force Recon Company, a respected Marine who nearly sacrificed himself to save John's life.Home from Iraq, John pays a visit to his former captain, only to discover the captain has been gruesomely murdered. John pursues a strange man he sees running from the scene, but he discovers that Alex Martin is not the murderer. Alex is, in fact, the former captain's secret male lover and the killer's intended next victim. When it becomes clear that local law enforcement has direct connections to the murder itself, John realizes that to repay his debt of honor, he must teach Alex Martin how to protect himself, even if that means teaching Alex to kill. In the process, John confronts the painful truth about the younger brother he was unable to protect and the older sister he always felt he failed.Blind Fall is a story of honor and integrity, of turning failure into victory. It is a stunning departure for Christopher Rice: the story of two men, one a Marine, one gay, who must unite to avenge the death of the man they both loved -- one as a brother-in-arms, one as a lover -- and to survive.	2008-03-11	Scribner						ZZZ000000

9781416540694	The Best Life Diet	Bob Greene		From the bestselling author of Get With the Program! and Bob Greene's Total Body Makeover comes The Best Life Diet, a lifetime plan for losing weight and keeping it off. Bob Greene helped Oprah achieve her dramatic weight loss, and he can help you too. You'll eat the same delicious food that Oprah enjoys, and, just like Oprah, you'll have Bob to encourage you at every step. Unlike a celebrity, however, you don't need to hire a staff of experts to aid and advise you, because Bob's plan, easily tailored to an array of tastes, lifestyles, and activity levels, acts as your personal trainer and private nutritionist. Just open the book and let Bob help you get started down the path toward your best possible life. What sets Bob apart from all the other experts who claim to have plans that work is that he admits that weight loss is difficult: seventeen years of watching people struggle to lose weight on a seemingly endless string of trendy crash diets, only to backslide and regain the pounds they've shed, have taught him that dropping pounds is not simply a numbers game. By acknowledging that it is not simple laziness but a complicated web of social rituals, cultural expectations, and habits that drives people to gain weight, Greene is able to attack the problem of weight loss realistically and offer not a short-lived, quick-fix formula, but a long-term program that accounts for the challenges and constraints of the real world.Divided into three phases, The Best Life Diet gives you the tools you need to change your life. In each phase, you'll be asked to reexamine the decisions you make on a daily basis and gradually alter your habits to achieve lasting results. The book also includes easy-to-follow meal plans that make it simple to meet your daily energy and nutrient requirements, whether you are on the run and breakfast means a quick smoothie or you have time to shop for fresh produce and make something special. You'll watch the weight disappear as you learn to prepare festive and flavorful dishes like Fire-Roasted Tomato-Shrimp Veracruz, Chicken Sausage Jambalaya, or Flank Steak with Chimichurri Topping and indulge in desserts like Roasted Peaches with Ricotta and Almonds or Apple Rhubarb Walnut Crisp. And for each delicious recipe, there is a detailed nutritional analysis, so you know exactly what you are eating and how it fits into your personal eating plan. Most important, Bob's plan doesn't end once you've lost the weight. Instead, it gives you the tools you need to make living your best life second nature, because for Greene, a diet is not something you go "on" or "off" but a set of guidelines that will help you claim the life you deserve.	2007-12-26	Simon & Schuster						ZZZ000000
9781416568209	Egonomics,What Makes Ego Our Greatest Asset (or Most Expensive Liability)	David Marcum&S. Smith		BUSINESS & MANAGEMENT. Informs readers that the key to great leadership is understanding exactly what ego is - and what it should not be. With the aid of real-life examples and persuasive writing, egonomics argues that while most people believe ego is negative, it is actually a healthy, necessary element to management effectiveness and business leadership. Marcum and Smith illustrate that the distinction between a good and a great leader is how humility affects their ambition, and egonomics is full of ideas that help both upper and middle management keep their egos in balance. With a compelling combination of business and psychology expertise, these two specialists explain how (a) being too competitive can make you less competitive, (b) seeking respect and recognition dilutes effectiveness and (c) humility, curiosity and veracity are the essential components to outstanding leadership.	2007-10	Simon & Schuster						ZZZ000000
9781416575375	The Eye of Jade	Diane Wei Liang		"Having her own detective agency would give her the independence she had always longed for. It would also give her the chance to show those people who shunned her that she could be successful. People were getting rich. They owned property, money, business, and cars. With new freedom and opportunities came new crimes. There would be much that she could do." Present day, Beijing. Mei Wang is a modern, independent woman. She has her own apartment. She owns a car. She has her own business with that most modern of commodities -- a male secretary. Her short career with China's prestigious Ministry for Public Security has given her intimate insight into the complicated and arbitrary world of Beijing's law enforcement. But it is her intuition, curiosity, and her uncanny knack for listening to things said -- and unsaid -- that make Mei Beijing's first successful female private investigator.Mei is no stranger to the dark side of China. She was six years old when she last saw her father behind the wire fence of one of Mao's remote labor camps. Perhaps as a result, Mei eschews the power plays and cultural mores --guanxi-- her sister and mother live by...for better and for worse.Mei's family friend "Uncle" Chen hires her to find a Han dynasty jade of great value: he believes the piece was looted from the Luoyang Museum during the Cultural Revolution -- when the Red Guards swarmed the streets, destroying so many traces of the past -- and that it's currently for sale on the black market. The hunt for the eye of jade leads Mei through banquet halls and back alleys, seedy gambling dens and cheap noodle bars near the Forbidden City. Given the jade's provenance and its journey, Mei knows to treat the investigation as a most delicate matter; she cannot know, however, that this case will force her to delve not only into China's brutal history, but also into her family's dark secrets and into her own tragic separation from the man she loved in equal parts.The first novel in an exhilarating new detective series,The Eye of Jadeis both a thrilling mystery and a sensual and fascinating journey through modern China.	2008-02-05	Simon & Schuster, Incorporated						FIC022000

9781416562450	A remarkable mother	Jimmy Carter		A Remarkable Mother is President Carter's loving, admiring, wry homage to Miss Lillian Carter, who championed the underdog always, even when her son was president. A registered nurse, pecan grower, university housemother, Peace Corps volunteer, public speaker, and renowned raconteur, Miss Lillian ignored the mores and prejudices of the racially segregated South of the Great Depression years. She was an avid supporter of the Brooklyn Dodgers (because she happened to attend the first major league baseball game in which Jackie Robinson, from Cairo, Georgia, played), was a favored guest on television talk shows (usually able to "steal the microphone" from hosts such as Johnny Carson and Walter Cronkite), and an important role model for the nation. Jimmy Carter's mother emerges from this portrait as redoubtable, generous, and forward-looking. He ascribes to her the inspiration for his own life's work of commitment and faith.	2008-04-01	Simon & Schuster						ZZZ000000
9780743289535	Julius Caesar	Philip Freeman		More than two thousand years after his death, Julius Caesar remains one of the great figures of history. He shaped Rome for generations, and his name became a synonym for "emperor" -- not only in Rome but as far away as Germany and Russia. He is best known as the general who defeated the Gauls and doubled the size of Rome's territories. But, as Philip Freeman describes in this fascinating new biography, Caesar was also a brilliant orator, an accomplished writer, a skilled politician, and much more.Julius Caesar was a complex man, both hero and villain. He possessed great courage, ambition, honor, and vanity. Born into a noble family that had long been in decline, he advanced his career cunningly, beginning as a priest and eventually becoming Rome's leading general. He made alliances with his rivals and then discarded them when it suited him. He was a spokesman for the ordinary people of Rome, who rallied around him time and again, but he profited enormously from his conquests and lived opulently. Eventually he was murdered in one of the most famous assassinations in history.Caesar's contemporaries included some of Rome's most famous figures, from the generals Marius, Sulla, and Pompey to the orator and legislator Cicero as well as the young politicians Mark Antony and Octavius (later Caesar Augustus). Caesar's legendary romance with the Egyptian queen Cleopatra still fascinates us today.In this splendid biography, Freeman presents Caesar in all his dimensions and contradictions. With remarkable clarity and brevity, Freeman shows how Caesar dominated a newly powerful Rome and shaped its destiny. This book will captivate readers discovering Caesar and ancient Rome for the first time as well as those who have a deep interest in the classical world.	2008-05-13	Simon & Schuster						ZZZ000000

9780743478885	Triple H,making the game	Triple H.&Robert Caprio		Love him or hate him, Triple H does what he wants, when he wants to do it. And now, for the first time anywhere, he tells you how he does it -- and how you can, too.More than a personal account of life in and out of the ring, Making The Game: Triple H's Approach to a Better Body is Triple H's verbal and visual blueprint for building your body. The leader of Evolution discusses how "a jones for bodybuilding and a love for wrestling" morphed a skinny, 135-pound fourteen-year-old from Nashua, New Hampshire, into one of the biggest superstars ever to dominate World Wrestling Entertainment. But be warned -- the "Cerebral Assassin" has zero tolerance for anything less than a hundred percent effort. He's spent the past twenty years living by the philosophy that training results in improved strength and conditioning, self-discipline, and an ability to focus on setting goals. This book isn't for big mouths who'd rather exercise their egos than their deltoids.Of course, even Triple H had help along the way. He didn't get to be "that damn good" without the support of a loving family. And over the years several bodybuilders (including world-renowned trainer Charles Glass) worked with him to develop the best training regimens. Their advice, plus hardcore commitment, helped Paul Levesque survive "The Hard Way In" through Walter "Killer" Kowalski's wrestling school in Malden, Massachusetts, and go on to become "Terra Ryzing" within Kowalski's International Wrestling Federation; enabled a "GUD" ("Geographically UnDesirable") to adjust to a difficult life on the road as "the French guy" in World Championship Wrestling; and gave "Hunter Hearst-Helmsley" the self-assurance to earn his stripes in WWE and eat something that literally made other up-and-comers squeal.On the subject of food consumption, Making The Game imparts tips as essential as exercise is for burning off calories and adding on muscle. Triple H spends over two hundred days a year on the road, and his traveler's guide will help you find ideal meals even in fast-food restaurants. He also provides the template for a must-have training-and-meals diary. Triple H reveals the dietary plan that he claims stokes his furnace 24/7 -- the plan he believes is "the single biggest element" in transforming his physique.Nevertheless, for a World Champion in WWE, it's as the saying goes: "No pain, no gain." That's why Making The Game breaks down and demonstrates the split-training workout program Triple H has embraced to achieve new levels of success in sculpting his body. Between drilling you with reps and sets, he relates in painstaking detail how training gave him the inner strength to shoulder the brunt of a controversial "Curtain Call" in the ring and, later, to elevate his position with Stone Cold Steve Austin and The Rock as one of the "Big Three" in WWE. Then, after breaking a sweat with Triple H reliving the fateful Raw events of May 2001 that left him with a torn quadricep muscle, you too can feel "The Triple H Burn," one of the exercises he endured through nine months of intense physical therapy to repair his leg that had been destroyed and resume a career most considered was "Game Over." Pain is temporary...but "The Game" is forever.Besides offering step-by-step exercises for both novice bodybuilders and those looking to radically advance their workout, Making The Game weighs in on the science behind progressive-training resistance and rest-pause techniques; the significance of exercise form over volume; the truth behind achieving "six-pack abs"; the dangers of overtraining and "skullcrushing" exercises that risk injury; and how creativity can go a long way in your workout. Triple H sees it as his mission to provide the guidelines for you to follow in the months and years ahead. And if there's one thing he knows how to do, it's succeed.It's time to stop playing The Game...and time to start Making The Game.	2004-12-07	Pocket Books						ZZZ000000

9780743248204	Jarhead.,A Marine's Chronicle of the Gulf War.	Anthony Swofford		"Swofford weaves this experience of war with vivid accounts of boot camp (which included physical abuse by his drill instructor), reflections on the mythos of the marines, and remembrances of battles with lovers and family. As engagement with the Iraqis draws closer, he is forced to consider what it is to be an American, a soldier, a son of a soldier, and a man." "Unlike the real-time print and television coverage of the Gulf War, which was highly scripted by the Pentagon, Swofford's account subverts the conventional wisdom that U.S. military interventions are now merely surgical insertions of superior forces that result in few American casualties. Jarhead insists we remember the Americans who are in fact wounded or killed, the fields of smoking enemy corpses left behind, and the continuing difficulty that American soldiers have reentering civilian life."--BOOK JACKET.	2003	Simon & Schuster Australia						ZZZ000000

This hidden history involves domestic spying, abuses of power, and outrageous operations. It includes a CIA that became caught in a political crossfire it could not withstand, even against the wishes of the commander-in-chief.

9780743295055	The end of Iraq,how American incompetence created a war without end	Peter W. Galbraith		The invasion of Iraq by American, British and other coalition forces has indeed transformed the Middle East, but not as the Bush and Blair administrations had imagined. It is Iran, not Western-style democracy, that has emerged as the big winner, creating a Tehran-Baghdad axis that would have been unthinkable before the war. THE END OF IRAQ is the definitive account of the US and UK's catastrophic involvement in Iraq, as told by America's leading independent expert on the country. Peter Galbraith reveals in exquisite detail how US policies -- some going back to the Reagan administration -- have now produced a nearly independent Kurdistan in the north, an Islamic state in the south, and uncontrollable insurgency in the centre, and an incipient Sunni-Shiite civil war that has Baghdad as its central front. Iraq, Galbraith argues, cannot be reconstructed as a single state. Instead, a sensible strategy must accept that it has already broken up and focus instead on stopping an escalating civil war. Unflinching, accessible and powerful, THE END OF IRAQ explores and explains the myriad mistakes and false assumptions that have brought the country to its current pass, and what must be done to prevent further bloodshed.	2006-07-31	Simon & Schuster						ZZZ000000

9780743285513	Marley legend,an illustrated life of Bob Marley	James Henke		Though musical history is full of great artists, a select few reach 'legend' status. In most cases, the ones that do qualify have made an impact that carries well beyond their music, and their influence has often been intensified by their premature, tragic deaths. Elvis Presley and John Lennon are two examples of such musicians, and a look back at the last century brings another name to the forefront: Bob Marley. Marley's enduring significance was already recognized just three years after his death, when the posthumous album of his greatest hits was titled LEGEND. Marley is the ultimate hero-musician, regarded by his fans not just as a pop star, but as one of their own - a man who rose out of poverty to become the voice of his people and his culture, of peace and love. MARLEY LEGEND will celebrate the life and work of Bob Marley in a compelling, interactive format that will bring him closer to his fans than ever before. In the twenty-five years after his death, Bob Marley's legend has only grown and new generations have discovered this extraordinary man's music and beliefs, this beautifully packaged book will be the ultimate collectors' item.	2006	Simon & Schuster						ZZZ000000

9780743259262	Alliance,the inside story of how Roosevelt, Stalin and Churchill won one war and began another	Jonathan Fenby		The history of the Second World War is usually told through its decisive battles and campaigns. But behind the front lines, behind even the command centres of Allied generals and military planners, a different level of strategic thinking was going on. Throughout the war the 'Big Three' -- Churchill, Roosevelt and Stalin -- met in various permutations and locations to thrash out ways to defeat Nazi Germany -- and, just as importantly, to decide the way Europe would look after the war. This was the political rather than military struggle: a battle of wills and diplomacy between three men with vastly differing backgrounds, characters -- and agendas. Focusing on the riveting interplay between these three extraordinary personalities, Jonathan Fenby re-creates the major Allied conferences including Casablanca, Potsdam and Yalta to show exactly who bullied whom, who was really in control, and how the key decisions were taken. With his customary flair for narrative, character and telling detail, Fenby's account reveals what really went on in those smoke-filled rooms and shows how "jaw-jaw" as well as "war-war" led to Hitler's defeat and the shape of the post-war world.	2006-11-14	Simon & Schuster						ZZZ000000

9781416526254	The End of Iraq,How American Incompetence Created a War Without End	Peter W. Galbraith		The invasion of iraq by American, British and other coalition forces has indeed transformed the Middle East, but not as the Bush and Blair administrations had imagined. it is iran, not Western-style democracy, that has emerged as the big winner, creating a Tehran-Baghdad axis that would have been unthinkable before the war. THE END OF IRAQ is the definitive account of the US and UK's catastrophic involvement in iraq, as told by America's leading independent expert on the country. Peter Galbraith reveals in exquisite detail how US policies -- some going back to the Reagan administration -- have now produced a nearly independent Kurdistan in the north, an islamic state in the south, and uncontrollable insurgency in the centre, and an incipient Sunni-Shiite civil war that has Baghdad as its central front. iraq, Galbraith argues, cannot be reconstructed as a single state. instead, a sensible strategy must accept that it has already broken up and focus instead on stopping an escalating civil war. Unflinching, accessible and powerful, THE END OF IRAQ explores and explains the myriad mistakes and false assumptions that have brought the country to its current pass, and what must be done to prevent further bloodshed.	2007-03-31	Pocket books						ZZZ000000

9781847370488	Einstein,His Life and Universe	Walter Isaacson		Einstein is the great icon of our age: the kindly refugee from oppression whose wild halo of hair, twinkling eyes, engaging humanity and extraordinary brilliance made his face a symbol and his name a synonym for genius. He was a rebel and nonconformist from boyhood days. His character, creativity and imagination were related, and they drove both his life and his science. In this marvellously clear and accessible narrative, Walter Isaacson explains how his mind worked and the mysteries of the universe that he discovered. Einstein's success came from questioning conventional wisdom and marvelling at mysteries that struck others as mundane. This led him to embrace a worldview based on respect for free spirits and free individuals. All of which helped make Einstein into a rebel but with a reverence for the harmony of nature, one with just the right blend of imagination and wisdom to transform our understanding of the universe. This new biography, the first since all of Einstein's papers have become available, is the fullest picture yet of one of the key figures of the twentieth century.	2007	Simon & Schuster, Limited						ZZZ000000

In the intervening years, during which Churchill cemented his place in history, his affinity with the Jews remained undimmed, even though his championing of Zionist issues and interests was often like a red rag to the bull of the British Establishment. One of those closest to Churchill once confided to the author that "Winston had one fault -- he was too fond of Jews." What does this mean? How did this fondness manifest itself? Exploring all aspects of his life and career, CHURCHILL AND THE JEWS sheds new light on a key figure of the twentieth century and how his attitudes affected not just the prosecution of the Second World War but the establishment of a Jewish state that followed it.	2007-06-04	Simon & Schuster						ZZZ000000

9780743275392	Empire of Blue Water,Captain Morgan's Great Pirate Army, the Epic Battle for the Americas, and the Catastrophe That Ended the Outlaws' Bloody Reign	Stephan Talty		Henry Morgan, a twenty-year-old Welshman, arrived in the New World in 1655, hell-bent on making his fortune. Over the next three decades, his exploits in the Caribbean in the service of the English became legend. His daring attacks on the mighty Spanish Empire on land and sea changed the fates of kings and queens. His victories helped shape the destiny of the New World. Morgan gathered disaffected English and European sailors and soldiers, hard-bitten adventurers, runaway slaves, cutthroats and sociopaths and turned them into the fiercest and most feared army in the Western Hemisphere. Sailing out from the English stronghold of Port Royal, Jamaica, 'the wickedest city in the New World', Morgan and his men terrorised Spanish merchant ships and devastated the cities where great riches in silver, gold, and gems lay waiting to be sent to the King of Spain. His last raid, a daring assault on the fabled city of Panama, helped break Spain's solitary hold on the New World for ever. Awash with bloody battles, political intrigues, and a cast of characters more compelling, bizarre and memorable than any found in a Hollywood swashbuckler, EMPIRE OF BLUE WATER brilliantly re-creates the passions and the violence of the age of exploration and empire. What's more, it chillingly depicts the apocalyptic natural disaster that finally ended the pirates' dominion.	2007	Simon & Schuster, Limited						ZZZ000000
9781847370822	Brothers,The Hidden History of the Kennedy Years	David Talbot		Robert F. Kennedy was the first conspiracy theorist about his brother's murder. In this astonishingly compelling and convincing new account of the Kennedy years, acclaimed journalist David Talbot tells in a riveting, superbly researched narrative why, even on 22 November 1963, RFK had reason to believe that dark forces were at work in Dallas and reveals, for the first time, that he planned to open an investigation into the assassination had he become president in 1968. BROTHERS also portrays a JFK administration more besieged by internal enemies than has previously been realised, from within the Pentagon, the CIA, the FBI and the mafia. This frightening portrait of sinister elements within and without the government serves as the background for the emotionally charged journey of Robert Kennedy. Reading it, you can absolutely believe any number of people would have been happy for both brothers to meet a sticky end. The tragedy, not just for America but for the world, is that since their murders no one has had the nerve to stand against the dark forces they challenged in quite the same way.	2007-06-04	Simon & Schuster						ZZZ000000
9781847371034	Born Standing Up,A Comic's Life	Steve Martin		Steve Martin has been an international star for over thirty years. Here, for the first time, he looks back to the beginning of his career and charmingly evokes the young man he once was. Born in Texas but raised in California, Steve was seduced early by the comedy shows that played on the radio when the family travelled back and forth to visit relatives. When Disneyland opened just a couple of miles away from home, an enchanted Steve was given his first chance to learn magic and entertain an audience. He describes how he noted the reaction to each joke in a ledger - 'big laugh' or 'quiet' - and assiduously studied the acts of colleagues, stealing jokes when needed. With superb detail, Steve recreates the world of small, dark clubs and the fear and exhilaration of standing in the spotlight. While a philosophy student at UCLA, he worked hard at local clubs honing his comedy and slowly attracting a following until he was picked up to write for TV. From here on, Steve Martin became an acclaimed comedian, packing out venues nationwide. One night, however, he noticed empty seats and realised he had 'reached the top of the rollercoaster'. BORN STANDING UP is a funny and riveting chronicle of how Steve Martin became the comedy genius we now know and is also a fascinating portrait of an era.	2007-01-01	Simon & Schuster, Limited						BIO005000

9780743286145	Diamonds, gold and war,the making of South Africa	Martin Meredith		The prize was great -- not just land, but the riches it held, in the form of diamonds and gold. What became a country called South Africa was, until 1910, a vast and untamed land where great fortunes could be made (and lost); where great battles were fought (and lost); and where great men had their reputations forged, or dashed, or sometimes both. Martin Meredith's follow-up to his magisterial THE STATE OF AFRICA is an equally epic new history of the making of South Africa. Covering the extraordinarily eventful four decades leading up to the establishment of the Union of South Africa in 1910, it covers some of the most iconic tales of imperial history. The Zulus at Rorke's Drift; the Jameson Raid; the diamond and gold rushes at Kimberley and Witwatersrand; the Boer wars; the titanic struggle between the arch-imperialist Cecil Rhodes and his Boer rival, Paul Kruger -- DIAMONDS, GOLD AND WAR brings all of these and more together in a stunningly coherent and compelling narrative. History, somehow, just isn't as colourful any more.	2007-01-01	Simon & Schuster						ZZZ000000

9781847371003	What Are You Optimistic About?	John Brockman		The nightly news and conventional wisdom tell us that things are bad and getting worse. Yet despite dire predictions, scientists see many good things on the horizon. John Brockman, publisher of Edge (www.edge.org), the influential online salon, recently asked more than 150 high-powered scientific thinkers to answer a vital question for our frequently pessimistic times: "What are you optimistic about?"  Spanning a wide range of topics--from string theory to education, from population growth to medicine, and even from global warming to the end of world--"What Are You Optimistic About?" is an impressive array of what world-class minds (including Nobel Laureates, Pulitzer Prize winners, "New York Times" bestselling authors, and Harvard professors, among others) have weighed in to offer carefully considered optimistic visions of tomorrow. Their provocative and controversial ideas may rouse skepticism, but they might possibly change our perceptions of humanity's future.	2007-01	Simon & Schuster						ZZZ000000
9780743248396	Bambi Vs. Godzilla,On the Nature, Purpose, and Practice of the Movie Business	David Mamet		In BAMBI VS. GODZILLA, David Mamet, the award-winning playwright and screenwriter, gives us an exhilaratingly subversive inside look at Hollywood from the perspective of a film-maker who has always played the game his own way. Who really reads scripts at the film studios? How is a screenplay like a personals ad? Whose opinion matters when revising a screenplay? Why are there so many producers listed in movie credits? And what the hell do those producers do, anyway? Refreshingly unafraid to offend, Mamet provides hilarious, surprising and bracingly forthright answers to these and other questions about virtually every aspect of film-making, from concept to script to screen. Demigods and sacred cows of the movie business -- beware! But for the rest of us, Mamet speaking truth to Hollywood makes for searingly enjoyable reading, and will sit alongside classics like ADVENTURES IN THE SCREEN TRADE as essential primers on the movie business.	2008-02	Simon & Schuster						ZZZ000000

Bush's foreign policy as the worst in history. Not because people disagreed, but because it was unheard-of for former presidents to attack incumbents. But Carter is no ordinary former president. Now eighty-two years old, and nearly thirty years after he left office, Carter has experienced arguably the fullest and most effective post-presidential career in history, including winning the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002.

9781847391070	Death of a Dissident,The Poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko and the Return of the KGB	Alex Goldfarb&Marina Litvinenko		The first reports seemed absurd. A Russian dissident, formerly an employee of the KGB and its successor, the FSB, had seemingly been poisoned in a London hotel. As Alexander Litvinenko's condition worsened, however, and he was transferred to hospital and placed under armed guard, the story took a sinister turn. On 23 November 2006, Litvinenko died, apparently from polonium-210 radiation poisoning. He himself, in a dramatic statement from his deathbed, accused his former employers at the Kremlin of being responsible for his murder. Who was Alexander Litvinenko? What had happened in Russia since the end of the Cold War to make his life there untenable, and even in severe jeopardy in Britain? How did he really die, and who killed him? In his spokesman and close friend, Alex Goldfarb, and widow Marina, we have two people who know more than anyone about the real Sasha Litvinenko, and about his murder. Their riveting book sheds astonishing light not just on these strange and troubling events but also on the biggest crisis in relations with Russia since the fall of the Berlin Wall.	2008-03-03	Simon & Schuster, Limited						ZZZ000000

9781847371225	Egonomics	Dave Marcum&Steven Smith		Backed by five years of research, David Marcum and Steven Smith's egonomics informs readers that the key to great leadership is understanding exactly what ego is - and what it should not be. With the aid of real-life examples and persuasive writing, egonomics  argues that while most people believe ego is negative, it is actually a healthy, necessary element to management effectiveness and business leadership. Marcum and Smith illustrate that the distinction between a good and a great leader is how humility affects their ambition, and egonomics  is full of ideas that help both upper and middle management keep their egos in balance. With a compelling combination of business and psychology expertise, these two specialists explain how (a) being too competitive can make you less competitive, (b) seeking respect and recognition dilutes effectiveness and (c) humility, curiosity and veracity are the essential components to outstanding leadership. Full of the best advice from the experts in the field, egonomics is poised to be the blockbuster business bestseller of the season.	2008-01-07	Simon & Schuster						ZZZ000000

9781847371270	Child 44	Tom Rob Smith		Stalin's Russia, 1953. In a time when the only crimes acknowledged are those against the state, one man is determined to uncover the truth behind a series of murders the government denies. Inspired by real-life serial killer Andrei Chikatilo, nicknamed the Butcher of Rostov, Child 44 is a thrillingly dark literary debut by 29 year-old Cambridge graduate Tom Rob Smith. Drawing from elements of Chikatilo's life, including his traumatising childhood growing up during the famine caused by Stalin's agricultural policies, and his luring of victims from train stations into nearby woods before killing and mutilating them, this debut literary thriller will keep you on the edge of your seat while enveloping you in the claustrophobic and paranoid Russia that existed under Stalin's rule. When Leo Demidov, one of the country's most loyal Security Ministry officers starts to question the State cover-up of crimes, his comfortable life takes a dramatic turn. Forced by senior officials to dismiss the horrific murder of a young boy and witnessing the torture of an alleged spy Leo knows is innocent, he chooses to give up his protected life to save his marriage, already on the brink of collapse. His decision leads them to a town deep in the Ural Mountains where he uncovers the murder of another child, a murder which bares a frightening resemblance to a child murder he was forced to deny. With a killer on the loose, murdering children and dumping their bodies near train tracks all over the country, Leo and his wife set off on a wild hunt across Russia, risking disgrace, torture and death to hunt down the killer. Capturing to incredible poverty and the terrifying world the Russian people endured under Stalin's rule, Child 44 is thrilling and horrifying, an intense detective story that will haunt you long after you've read the last page.	2008-01-31	Simon & Schuster						ZZZ000000

9781847372666	Darwin's armada	Iain McCalman		Darwin's Armada tells the stories of Charles Darwin, Thomas Huxley, Joseph Hooker and Alfred Wallace, four young amateur naturalists from Britain who voyaged to the southern hemisphere during the first half of the nineteenth century in search of adventure and scientific fame. It charts their thrilling voyages to the strange and beautiful lands of the southern hemisphere that reshaped the young mariners' scientific ideas and led them, on returning to Britain, to befriend fellow voyager Charles Darwin.

For the first time the Darwinian revolution of ideas is seen as a genuinely collective enterprise and one that had its birth in a series of gripping and human travel adventures.

9780743295369	The Book of Love	Kathleen McGowan		Cultures throughout Europe believed there was once a gospel written in Christ's own hand, a treasure of almost unimaginable magnitude. It was referred to by the Cathar culture in France, who claimed to be direct descendants of Christ, as The Book of Love. But the teachings in The Book of Love were radical and contrary to the political agenda of the Church. Papal forces launched one of the bloodiest crusades in history against the Cathars in an effort to wipe out their 'heresy' - and to gain possession of the original, incendiary manuscript - a document so revolutionary that its contents would be considered ground-breaking and visionary 2000 years later. In The Book of Love, Maureen Paschal continues her journey of discovery begun in The Expected One, following evidence in stone and stained glass, clues left 800 years ago by the ancient architects of the great Gothic cathedrals of Europe.

9781847376367	The Anthologist	Nicholson Baker		The Anthologist is narrated by Paul Chowder -- a once-in-a-while-published kind of poet who is writing the introduction to a new anthology of poetry. He's having a hard time getting started because his career is floundering, his girlfriend Roz has recently left him, and he is thinking about the great poets throughout history who have suffered far worse and deserve to feel sorry for themselves. He has also promised to reveal many wonderful secrets and tips and tricks about poetry, and it looks like the introduction will be a little longer than he'd thought. What unfolds is a wholly entertaining and beguiling love story about poetry: from Tennyson, Swinburne, and Yeats to the moderns (Roethke, Bogan, Merwin) to the staff of The New Yorker, what Paul reveals is astonishing and makes one realize how incredibly important poetry is to our lives. At the same time, Paul barely manages to realize all of this himself, and the result is a tenderly romantic, hilarious, and inspired novel.	2009-07-31	Simon & Schuster						ZZZ000000

In this brutally candid memoir, writer, translator and journalist Bruce Benderson recounts his unrequited love for an impoverished Romanian whom he meets while on a journalism assignment in Eastern Europe. Rather than retreat, Benderson absorbs everything he can about Romania, its culture and its history and discovers a mirror in it for his own turmoil: the wild affairs of its last king, Carol II. Free of bitterness, nastiness, or any desire to protect himself, he is sustained throughout by little white codeine pills, a poetic self-awareness, a sense of humor, and an unwavering belief in the perfect romance, even as wild dogs chase him down Romanian streets.	2006-05-01	Snowbooks						ZZZ000000

9781905005154	Drugs are nice	Lisa Crystal Carver		In 1987 in the small town of Dover, New Hampshire, Lisa and her best friend Rachel--both seventeen--set up a punk show at the Veteran's Hall. When the headlining act got lost and drunk and never showed up, the audience was angry and the promoters hid in the bathroom. Then Lisa got an idea. The girls put on the Saturday Night Fever soundtrack, mounted the stage, smoked cigars, caterwauled, took off their clothes and hit things and people. Suckdog--called 'the most interesting band in the world' by Melody Maker--was born. Lisa Carver left for Europe at the age of eighteen, quickly becoming a teen publisher (of the fanzines Dirt and Rollerderby), a teen bride (to French performance artist Jean-Louis Costes), and a teen prostitute (turning her first trick a few days before turning 20). Hustler called Rollerderby 'quite possibly the greatest zine ever,' and The Utne Reader chooses Lisa Carver as one of the '100 Visionaries Who Will Change Your Life.' But when her baby was born in 1994 with a chromosomal deletion and his dad --industrial music maven and rumored neo-Nazi Boyd Rice -- became violent, Lisa began to realize the life that needed changing was her own. A story of lasting lightness and surprising gravity, this is a book about the generation that wanted to break every rule. A definitive account of rules broken, left intact and re-written forever, it ripens into the classic account of an artist and a mother becoming an adult on her own terms.	2006-03-06	Snow Books						ZZZ000000

9780312304027	The bureau,the secret history of the FBI	Ronald Kessler		A former Washington Post and Wall Street Journal investigative reporter, and the New York Times bestselling author of Inside the White House , Ronald Kessler presents the definitive history of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Based on exclusive interviews, including the first with Robert Mueller since his nomination as director, The Bureau reveals startling new information about the bureau-from J. Edgar Hoover's blackmailing of Congress to the investigation of the September 11 attacks. With the FBI at the epicenter of the war on terrorism, no institution is as critically important to America's security. No American institution is as controversial. And, after the White House, Congress, and the Supreme Court, no institution is as powerful. Yet until now, no book has presented the full story of the FBI from its beginnings in 1908 to the present. Kessler focuses on the agents who have made its cases and the directors who have run the bureau, from Hoover through Louis Freeh and Robert Mueller. In doing so, he probes the relationship between the FBI and American presidents, and the tension that exists between a free society and what amounts to a national police force. Based on exclusive interviews-including the first interview with Mueller since his nomination-The Bureau reveals for the first time the dramatic inside story of the FBI's response to the attacks of September 11, including its investigation of the anthrax mailings. The book answers questions about the bureau's role and performance: Why did the FBI know nothing useful about al-Qaeda before the attacks? What is really behind the FBI's more aggressive investigative approaches that have raised civil liberties concerns? What does the FBI think of improvements in airline security? How safe does the FBI think America really is? Only Ronald Kessler could have obtained the access necessary to answer these questions. An award-winning investigative reporter, Kessler is the author of The FBI: Inside the World's Most Powerful Law Enforcement Agency , which led to the dismissal of William S. Sessions as director. From DNA analysis to criminal profiling, from confirmation of Supreme Court justices to investigations of plane crashes and spies, the FBI is involved in almost every aspect of American life. Painted against the canvas of America's development in the past hundred years, The Bureau tells the richly detailed story of a uniquely powerful institution, its profound impact on American society, and how it has changed since September 11.	2002	St. Martin's Press						ZZZ000000

He offers in-depth considerations of:* characterization * story arc * plotting and subplotting * dealing with coincidence in story plotting* classical vs. revolutionary screenplay structure * tone, style, and atmosphere * the use of time on screen* the creation of drama and tension * crucial moments in storytellingThroughout the book, Howard clarifies his lessons through examples from some of the most successful Hollywood and international script-oriented films, including Pulp Fiction, American Beauty, Trainspotting, North by Northwest, Chinatown, and others.

In Poisoned Wells , Nicholas Shaxson exposes the root causes of this paradox of poverty from plenty, and explores the mechanisms by which oil causes grave instabilities and corruption around the globe. Shaxson is the only journalist who has had access to the key players in African oil, and is willing to make the connections between the problems of the developing world and the involvement of leading global corporations and governments.	2007	Palgrave Macmillan						ZZZ000000
9781582345840	U-Turn,What If You Woke Up One Morning and Realized You Were Living the Wrong Life?	Bruce Grierson		Every day, in almost every field, someone perceives themselves to be on the wrong side of a psychic divide. The "second brain" in their gut tells them their life must change. Bruce Grierson draws on over 300 hundred stories of u-turners, including famous cases like Gandhi and Gauguin as well as a host of other gripping tales of people who have risked everything to answer life's wake-up call: people who change political parties and careers, people give up their jobs as doctors to become poets, men who become women, professional athletes who quit to spend more time with their families, mothers who quit their families to pursue careers, people who suddenly become revolutionaries for a cause they didn't care about the day before. Grierson examines the u-turn from all anglesphilosophical, scientific, literary and psychologicalbeginning with premise that the wake-up call is the secular equivalent of the religious epiphany, the moment when a person is "born again." When does the wake-up call happen? Often in mid-life, but not always. Is it a good thing? Yes and no. Who does it happen to? Potentially any of us, under the right circumstance. Is America ready for a mass u-turn? Maybe. In chapters that address everything from the neuroscience behind epiphanies (the eureka moment) to the possibility of "forcing" a u-turn, Grierson brilliantly describes and elucidates this powerful, mysterious phenomenon, and in doing so illuminates all or our continual struggles with life choices and identity.	2007-03-05	Bloomsbury						ZZZ000000

9780312365493	What on Earth Have I Done?,Stories, Observations, and Affirmations	Robert Fulghum		Robert Fulghum's new book begins with a question we've all asked ourselves: "What on Earth have I done?" As Fulghum finds out, the answer is never easy and, almost always, surprising. For the last couple of years, Fulghum has been traveling the world - from Seattle to the Moab Desert to Crete - looking for a few fellow travelers interested in thinking along with him as he delights in the unexpected: trick-or-treating with your grandchildren dressed like a large rabbit, pots of daffodils blooming in mid-November, a view of the earth from outer space, the mysterious night sounds of the desert, every man's trip to a department store to buy socks, the raucous all-night long feast that is Easter in Greece, the trials and tribulations of plumbing problems and the friendship one can strike up with someone who doesn't share the same language.What on Earth Have I Done?is an armchair tour of everyday life as seen by Robert Fulghum, one of America's great essayists, a man who has two feet planted firmly on the earth, one eye on the heavens and, at times, a tongue planted firmly in his cheek. Fulghum writes to his fellow travelers, with a sometimes light heart, about the deep and vexing mysteries of being alive and says, "This is my way of bringing the small boat of my life within speaking distance of yours.

9780805078329	The mind of the market,compassionate apes, competitive humans, and other tales from evolutionary economics	Michael Shermer		Bestselling author Michael Shermer explains how evolution shaped the modern economy--and why people are so irrational about money How did we make the leap from ancient hunter-gatherers to modern consumers and traders? Why do people get so emotional and irrational about bottom-line financial and business decisions? Is the capitalist marketplace a sort of Darwinian organism, evolved through natural selection as the fittest way to satisfy our needs? In this eye-opening exploration, author and psychologist Michael Shermer uncovers the evolutionary roots of our economic behavior. Drawing on the new field of neuroeconomics, Shermer investigates what brain scans reveal about bargaining, snap purchases, and establishing trust in business. He scrutinizes experiments in behavioral economics to understand why people hang on to losing stocks, why negotiations disintegrate into tit-for-tat disputes, and why money does not make us happy. He brings together astonishing findings from psychology, biology, and other sciences to describe how our tribal ancestry makes us suckers for brands, why researchers believe cooperation unleashes biochemicals similar to those released during sex, why free trade promises to build alliances between nations, and how even capuchin monkeys get indignant if they don't get a fair reward for their work. Michael Shermer is the author of nine previous books, including the bestselling "Why People Believe Weird Things." He is a columnist for "Scientific American," the publisher of "Skeptic "magazine, and the founder and director of the international Skeptics Society. He lives in Southern California. In this exploration, author and psychologist Michael Shermer uncovers the evolutionary roots of our economic behavior. How did we make the leap from ancient hunter-gatherers to modern consumers and traders? Why do people get so emotional and irrational about bottom-line financial and business decisions?

"The theme of Michael Shermer's new book is a graceful paradox. Decades of study of behavioral psychology, neuroscience and genetics, layered over more than a century of evolutionary studies, proves that we're not completely rational in making economic choices. But an understanding of our fascinating limitations, which Shermer provides, makes us freer than were before we know of them . . . The author, an adjunct economics professor at Claremont Graduate University, compares the argument for top-down, centrally planned economics to the argument for intelligent design. Devotees of the latter often argue that 'evolution' could not have designed something so complicated as the human eye, just as proponents of top-down economics argue, that, say, New York City needs the government to create jobs for the poor by doing things like build sports stadiums because the market won't do it on its own. Shermer easily demolishes another myth about both evolution and economics that both depend exclusively on cutthroat, bloody-handed 'survival of the fittest' competition to weed out the weakest creatures and companies . . . The most compelling chapters of Shermer's book take us on an intimate tour of the best of the last half-century's work in behavioral economics and neuroscience . . . Shermer notes that we must consciously choose freedom--all more important since the temptation, in light of the weird decisions we sometimes make in the marketplace, is to surrender to someone who must know better."--Nicole Gelinas, "The New York Post ""The nexus between economies and psychology has occupied scholars in the last several years. Field and laboratory experiments have tried to tease out and test the economist's assumptions of rationality, utility (or profit) maximization, and financial decision-making rules, and to formulate perhaps improved public policies in light of these research findings in what is known as 'behavioral economies.' Some attention has now turned to the intersections of economies and the neurosciences, with the use of brain scans to reveal underlying tendencies and patterns in human nature. Into the middle of these theoretical and empirical frays jumps Shermer ("Scientific American" columnist; adjunct economics professor, Claremont Graduate Univ.) delivering a well-written, highly entertaining summary of the issues and applications in the evolution of what makes people tick and markets function. Intelligent lay readers will be led from apes to pandas to primitive tribes and modern states, from Charles Darwin and Adam Smith to free will and free markets. Replete with thought-provoking examples and solid references, the book will start as many debates as it will end, but that is a reasonable goal and accomplishments of a journalist and self-proclaimed skeptic. Summing up: Recommended. General readers; all levels of undergraduate and graduate students; faculty and professionals."--A. R. Sanderson, University of Chicago, "Choice """The Mind of the Market "is a consistently stimulating inquiry into the (formerly) dismal science."--Ted Mumford, "The Globe and Mail ""I'm about to review a book on economics for you . . . no, no, stop, don't turn the page! It's a readable, entertaining book--about lots of things you don't associate with 'economics.' Like "Freakonomics," you'll find no graphs or calculus here, just a wee bit of jargon, and you'll get to read about sex and chimps, the brain wave for shopping, why biology makes us kind and dozens of other unusual topics you never studied in Econ 101."--Richard Parker, "The Globe Mail" (Toronto) "Charles Darwin and Adam Smith may seem like strange bedfellows, but bestselling author Michael Shermer finds the fathers of evolutionary theory and capitalism to be a perfect match . . . Drawing from research, and injecting his own wit, Shermer explains why people make bad decisions about money, why wealth can't buy you happiness, and why we love cooperating."--Meredith Knight, "Psychology Today ""Written with his customary verve and flair, "The Mind of the Market" is Michael Shermer at his best. Roving over the entire sweep of history, and drawing on the best of modern science, Shermer attempts a grand synthesis of research from psychology and the neurosciences to demonstrate that markets are moral and that free trade meshes well with human nature. Shermer entertains as well as informs, and in the process he deepens the argument for economic, political and social freedom."--Dinesh D'Souza, author of "What's So Great About America ""Economists who understand Charles Darwin are almost as rare as biologists who understand Adam Smith. Yet the two were essentially saying the same thing--that order emerges unordained from competition and innovation. Michael Shermer brilliantly brings the two insights together to explain how the human mind creates the human market."--Matt Ridley, author of "The Origins of Virtue ""Economics is not just about money. It is also about human nature, justice, trust, and happiness. Michael Shermer brilliantly shows that the real experts of "Homo economicus" are often found in psychology, biology, even primatology."--Frans de Waal, author of "Our Inner Ape ""Shermer applies his knowledge of evolutionary science to the volatile topic of modern economics. The founder and editor of "Skeptic" magazine does a bang-up job knitting together the complexities of science and the frail psychology of human beings to explain the unpredictable postmodern world of trade and finance. Pledging that economics is for everyone, the author offers a forbidding, textbook definition of evolutionary economics, then adds, 'this is a swanky way of saying that the economy is a very complex system that changed and adapted to circumstances as it evolved out of a much simpler system.' Exploring the transition from a hunter-gatherer economy to one based on consumer trade, Shermer argues that the world economy not only has a mind of its own but is also constantly shifting due to the influence of the consumers, traders and organizations that participate in it. Far from being needlessly complicated, the book tackles a host of psychological, scientific and ethical quandaries with clear-eyed panache, making its case with evidence not just from usual suspects like Adam Smith and Ayn Rand but also from the evolutionary science of Steven Jay Gould and the Western films of John Ford. Like any good teacher, Shermer grounds his lessons in real-world examples, some drawn from his personal experience as a marathon bicycle racer, some from the global marketplace and others lifted from scientific studies far outside the public domain . . . Shermer's argument that 'we must study the laws of human behavior in economics as the physicist, chemist, or biologist studies the laws of nature' is persuasive. An informative, inventive, broad-spectrum analysis of what makes modern man tick, starting with his wallet."--"Kirkus Reviews"	2008	Times Books						ZZZ000000

We know that he overcame a difficult childhood to star in astonishing array of blockbusters: Top Gun, Rain Man, Born on the Fourth of July, A Few Good Men, Interview with the Vampire, Jerry Maguire, three Mission: Impossible movies, War of the Worlds, and more. We know he has taken artistic chances, too, and as a result has earned three Academy Award nominations and three Golden Globes, along with the respect of acting legends like Paul Newman and Dustin Hoffman.After that, the picture becomes a little less clear. We know that Tom is a Scientologist, but not necessarily what that means in his life. We know that, despite persistent rumors about his sexuality, he has been married to Mimi Rogers, Nicole Kidman, and Katie Holmes. But it was not until the spring of 2005, when he jumped on Oprah's couch to proclaim his love for Katie and denounced Brooke Shields for turning to the 'Nazi science' of psychiatry, that we began to realize how much we didn't know about the charming, hardworking star.For two years, award-winning biographer Andrew Morton has been tirelessly seeking out everyone from former teachers and girlfriends to Scientology insiders to friends who have watched a once-bullied, 'nothing special' outsider transform himself into an icon Forbes has called the most powerful celebrity in the worldHere, with never-seen photos and never-heard revelations, is a riveting, sometimes shocking portrait of the real Tom Cruise---his work, his love life, his marriages, his religion---from a master at uncovering the true story behind the public face of celebrity.	2008-01-15	St. Martin's Press						ZZZ000000
9781596430976	The Snodgrass conspiracy	Grady Klein		Set in nineteenth-century America, "The Lost Colony "takes place on a mysterious island unknown to the rest of the world. No one knows it exists except its citizens, a colorful and outrageous band of capitalists, inventors, hucksters, and freemen. They jealously guard the island's fantastic wealth from the prying fingers of the outside world, even as they attempt to conceal its captivating secrets from one another. "The Lost Colony" is a boiling concoction of slavery, patriotism, religion, and greed--in many ways, the story of America itself. The first in an addictive new series for readers of all ages, "The Lost Colony" is a self-contained world filled with endearing and memorable characters, whose hilarious foibles overlay a plot that resonates with America's own historical struggles with issues such as profiteering, racism and slavery. Thoughtfully written, richly illustrated, and always hilarious, "The Lost Colony" welcomes you into a new world. Grady Klein is an award-winning freelance illustrator, designer, and animator. His work, which includes the animated short "The Dust Bunny," has appeared in print and on screen all over the world. Set in nineteenth-century America, "The Snodgrass Conspiracy "takes place on a mysterious island unknown to the rest of the world. Only its citizens--a colorful and outrageous band of capitalists, inventors, hucksters, and freemen--know it exists. They jealously guard the island's fantastic wealth from the prying fingers of the outside world, even as they attempt to conceal its captivating secrets from one another. The Lost Colony is a boiling concoction of slavery, patriotism, religion, and greed--in many ways, the story of America itself. "At first glance, this novel appears to be a cartoony rendition of America in the nineteenth century, but it quickly proves to be chock full of insight into the controversies of the past. The messages are hidden in plain sight as Klein uses his pictures to tell the real story behind all the words of the characters. A zany cast of slaves, ex-slaves, capitalists, opportunists, inventors, and just plain regular folk lead the way through this colorful and delightful tale. It would be a fantastic addition to public and most school libraries."--VOYA "Historical and contemporary American racial, economic, and social issues lie at the heart of this witty, sophisticated, candy-colored adventure, set in a utopian island community. Bertha (Birdy) Snodgrass, preadolescent daughter of the town banker, throws in her lot with a shady Chinese Mexican wizard, his golem-like assistant, and, finally, with Louis the slave. Readers with a grasp of pre-Jamestown history will have the easiest time understanding the riffs on Puritanism and the various American hypocrisies woven into this story. Racial and cultural slurs are buried beneath the surface of character interactions, and no ethnic group is spared. That, of course, is the point: to see oneself as a possible victim of prejudice, or, like Birdy, work toward changing things and make friends with people who are different. Teens (especially those enrolled in advanced-placement American history classes) as well as many adults will find a lot to enjoy and think about in this brash, fantastic tale--and they will look forward to other volumes in the planned series."--"Booklist" "Edweard Stoop makes his way onto an island that isn't on any maps and proceeds to paper it with posters for an upcoming slave auction. This act and his very presence precipitate a series of hijinx on the part of the residents. The characters are all given amusing ways of talking, and many have a secret agenda in their interactions, but the main point of the story is to provide or provoke a comic perspective on race and slavery, ending in a resolution that literally comes out of a machine . . . The artwork is clever, with marvelous colors and elegantly rendered backgrounds."--Benjamin Russell, " School Library Journal"	2006-05-02	First Second						ZZZ000000

Time-strapped, anxious parents hoping to provide the best for their baby are the perfect mark for the "parenting" industry. In "Parenting, Inc.," Pamela Paul investigates the whirligig of marketing hype, peer pressure, and easy consumerism that spins parents into purchasing overpriced products and raising overprotected, overstimulated, and over-provided-for children. Paul shows how the parenting industry has persuaded parents that they cannot trust their children's health, happiness, and success to themselves. She offers a behind-the-scenes look at the baby business so that any parent can decode the claims--and discover shockingly unuseful products and surprisingly effective services. And she interviews educators, psychologists, and parents to reveal why the best thing for a baby is to break the cycle of self-recrimination and indulgence that feeds into overspending. Paul's book leads the way for every parent who wants to escape the spiral of fear, guilt, competition, and consumption that characterizes modern American parenthood. Pamela Paul is a contributor to "Time "magazine and the author of "Pornified: How Pornography Is Damaging Our Lives, Our Relationships, and Our Families "and "The Starter Marriage and the Future of Matrimony." She writes for such publications as "The New York Times Book Review," "Psychology Today," "Self," "Ladies' Home Journal," and "The Economist." She lives with her family in New York. In "Parenting, Inc.," Pamela Paul investigates the parenting "industry" in which today's children are raised. Driven by marketing hype, peer pressure, and easy consumerism, parents purchase overpriced products and raise overprotected, overstimulated, and over-provided-for children. Time-strapped, anxious parents hoping to provide the best for their baby are drawn to the promises of parenting coaches, ergonomic strollers, music classes, sleep consultants, luxury diaper creams, a never-ending rotation of DVDs that will make a baby smarter, socially adept, and bilingual before age three. Paul shows how, over the past generation, the parenting industry has persuaded parents that they cannot trust themselves with their own children's health, happiness, and success. Instead, they learn to make important decisions based not on instincts and common sense, but on statistically-warped warning labels and celebrity endorsements. In decoding the claims of the business, Paul discovers surprisingly unuseful products as well as surprisingly effective services. She interviews educators, psychologists, and parents to reveal why the best thing for a baby is to break the cycle of self-recrimination and indulgence that feeds into overspending. Paul's book leads the way for every parent who wants to escape the tempting market of fear, guilt, competition, and consumption that characterizes modern American parenthood. "It's only natural to want the best for our kids; all parents do. But what does 'the best' mean? Pamela Paul takes us on a hair-raising journey of the products, services, and 'expert' guidance from which parents today feel compelled to choose and the time pressure, financial pressure, and self-doubt that turns them into nervous wrecks. Parents need the courage to be sensible again--they and their kids can use it. Buy this book and carry it with you whenever you walk into a baby store."--Barry Schwartz, author of "The Paradox of Choice ""You don't have a Crumb Chum chin-to-toe cover to put on your toddler at meal times? You haven't hired your 'momcierge' to organize your child's home library? Or a specialist in thumb sucking, under-sleeping, nail biting, or giving up overnight diapers? Relax. In this riveting book, Paul very much empathizes with the anxieties of eager first-time parents. At the same time, she gently helps us wonder whether we aren't, as a culture, going overboard--and deftly, brilliantly, helps us see the beauty in an alternative. She rings a bell we need to hear."--Arlie Hochschild, author of "The Time Bind" and "The Commercialization of Human Feeling ""There has been a great deal written about the commercialization of childhood, but "Parenting, Inc. "makes it clear that the commercialization of parenting is equally extensive and even more troubling. This important book will help parents become aware of how much of their parenting is being forced upon them by an unrelenting sales pitch."--David Elkind, professor of child development at Tufts University and author of "The Hurried Child""Paul, mother of two, probes the business of parenting, exposing the high price of raising kids in our consumer-driven nation. Paul points out that it costs upwards of a million dollars to raise a child in the U.S. these days, especially if one buys into the theory that baby must have everything on the market. Following the money, Paul dissects the booming baby business, including 'smart toys' that don't really make kids smarter, themed baby showers and parenting coaches and consultants. The text is a tireless rundown of parents' seemingly bottomless pocketbooks when it comes to bringing up baby, and according to Paul this is not just an upscale, cosmopolitan phenomenon--throughout the country parents are reaching deep into their pockets to fuel this spiraling craze. Though Paul incorporates the pithy quotes of a number of experts, such as psychologist David Elkind's observation, 'Computers are part of our environment, but so are microwaves and we don't put them in cribs' . . . [she] isn't preachy, although she does reveal that what babies really need is holding, singing, dancing, conversation and outdoor play."--"Publishers Weekly ""Author, journalist, and social critic Paul delivers a scathing commentary on parental consumerism. The subtitle says it all, but for readers needing evidence to entertain their assessment of parental consumer behavior, Paul supplies numerous examples of products parents purchase in an effort to assuage their guilt and/or maximize their children's intellectual performance. Some of the more obvious examples are designer strollers, baby sign-language DVDs, and instructional materials claiming to teach infants and toddlers to read. Paul . . . argues that most of these products can actually hinder development because they overstimulate infants, who may then not achieve even such customary milestones as speech development. Like Judith Warner's "Perfect Madness: Motherhood in the Age of Anxiety," this "sine qua non" for new parents is highly recommended."--Lynne F.

9788120730502	The Book on Solace	Bo Yin Ra		I here intend to show you how one may come to find such solace -- within one's inner-most self -- and then shall have no further need to be consoled by others. No consolation you receive from others can ever free you from the shackles of your grief -- unless such comfort teaches you how you may break those chains yourself. And how that inner art is learned, and put to use, the present work will teach you. Solace is of value only as a counter-force: an energy that lends you strength to overcome the hostile force of grief. No grief is everlasting, and you alone have power to prolong its life beyond its given span. If you would find enduring solace in yourself you must not blindly delve into your grief, nor constantly reopen wounds that are about to heal. It is above all else essential that your thoughts shall not continuously dwell upon and cleave to what you suffer.	2006-02-01	Sterling Publishers Pvt. Ltd						ZZZ000000

9783822845110	Film posters of the 30s,the essential movies of the decade : from the Reel Poster Gallery collection	Tony Nourmand&Graham Marsh		The 1930s were the cinema's age of innocence when, despite the miseries of the Grant Depression, or perhaps because of them, the emphasis was on escapism and entertainment. With the coming of the talkies, the Marx Brothers and Laurel & Hardy had supplanted Chaplin as the kings of slapstick comedy. Cary Grant and Katherine Hepburn were Bringing up Baby, Busby Berkely's precision-drilled chorus girls were Flying Down to Rio, Fred Astaire was donning his Top Hat and John Wayne was climbing on the Stagecoach to stardom. This was also the decade that set the mould for the Hollywood of the future, firmly establishing a range of genres such as the Western, the gangster movie, the screwball comedy and the musical, while stars like Grant and Hepburn, Gary Cooper, Marlene Dietrich and Greta Garbo became international icons. As this stunning collection of poster art confirms, the 30s were also the age of the illustrator, with Al Hirschfield, Hap Hadley and the incomparable Alberto Vargas setting new standards in graphic design. Colour may only just have been making its first appearance on the screens inside the cinemas, but on the hoardings outside the hues were bright and vibrant as never before.	2005-07-01	Taschen						ZZZ000000

9783822845219	Film posters of the 50s,the essential movies of the decade : from the Reel Poster Gallery collection	Tony Nourmand&Graham Marsh		The cinema of the 1950s reflected the mood swings of the post-war generation. Optimistic epics and brittle social comedies rubbed shoulders with socially aware dramas and, faced with the new challenge of television, the studios conjured up a host of fresh attractions: CinemaScope, Vista-Vision and 3D, the curves of Marilyn Monroe and the moody mumbles of Marlon Brando and James Dean. In Hollywood, veteran actors circled the wagons against the massed assault of juvenile delinquents as the Wild West became the Asphalt Jungle. In Britain, upper lips remained stiff - though a smile or two was permitted at the latest Ealing Comedy. Films from Italy and France, where the 'New Wave' was starting to break, were still considered strictly high culture, if not threateningly risque, in the Anglophone nations. The images in this book represent the full range of poster art which attracted world wide cinema audiences to the movies of the decade. Some may be familiar, others, long forgotten, will come as surprises. Most are still as fresh and powerful as the day they first appeared.	2005-07-01	Taschen						ZZZ000000
9783822848159	Burton Holmes Travelogues,The Greatest Traveler of His Time, 1890-1938	Burton Holmes&Genoa Caldwell		Wanderlust: Burton Holmes, the father of the Travelogue All the delights of travel for those who stay at home. In a time before air travel or radio, on the brink of a revolution in photography and filmmaking, Burton Holmes (1870-1958) set upon a lifelong journey to bring the world home. From the grand boulevards of Paris to China's Great Wall, from the first modern Olympics in Athens to the 1906 eruption of Mount Vesuvius, Holmes delighted in finding ?the beautiful way around the world? and made a career of sharing his stories, photographs, and films with audiences across America. As a young man, Holmes was mentored by John L. Stoddard, a pioneer of the U.S. travel lecture circuit, who passed on his well-established mantle when he retired. Holmes roamed the globe throughout the summer and traversed the United States all winter, transforming the staid lecture tradition into an entertaining show. He coined the term ?Travelogue? in 1904 to advertise his unique performance and thrilled audiences with two-hour sets of stories timed to projections of hand-painted glass-lantern slides and some of the first "moving pictures." Paris, Peking, Dehli, Dubrovnick, Moscow, Manila, Jakarta, Jerusalem: Burton Holmes was there. He visited every continent and nearly every country on the planet, shooting over 30,000 photographs and nearly 500,000 feet of film. This book represents the best of the Holmes archive, brimming with brilliant color photographs not published in decades. A rare window on the world of 100 years ago, Burton Holmes Travelogues will transport you to a time that has all but evaporated, and inspire you to strike out on a journey of your own. The author: In the 1960s, Genoa Caldwell wasthe New York-based photo researcher for the London Sunday Times, as well as photo editor for both Black Star and Magnum. While operating her own photo agency in Los Angeles in the 1970s, Caldwell was introduced to the work of Burton Holmes and became private archivist for the extensive and unique photographic collection. Caldwell has maintained the collection for over 30 years and has lectured and published on the life and work of Burton Holmes.	2006-09-01	Taschen						ZZZ000000

9783822825921	Arnold Newman	Philip Brookman		Portrait photographer extraordinaire I?m not so much interested in documenting as in expressing my impressions of the individuals with the constantly expanding narrative means of my medium. ?Arnold Newman Piet Mondrian behind his easel, Igor Stravinsky at his piano, Max Ernst sitting smoking on his throne-like chair: the photographs of Arnold Newman (1918-2006) are classics of portraiture. His subtle arrangements constituted the foundations of ?environmental portraiture.? His photographs integrate the respective artist's characteristic equipment and surroundings, thus indicating his or her field of activity. The enormous fame of Newman's portraits can be ascribed to their daring compositions and sometimes astounding spatial structures. The photographer's beginnings, however, were none too promising. During the Great Depression, Newman had to abandon his art studies for financial reasons. Between 1938 and 1942 he concentrated on socio-documentary photography in the ghettos of West Palm Beach, Philadelphia, and Baltimore. One might think that being forced to earn his living in a photography studio would have stifled his artistic potential: Newman portrayed up to 70 clients a day. Yet he still succeeded in developing a very personal touch and establishing himself in the New York art scene of the early 1940s. His subjects included Marcel Duchamp, Marc Chagall, Jackson Pollock, Willem de Kooning, and Alexander Calder among many others. With his unmistakable style, Newman became the star photographer of artists, writers, and musicians. This new edition, which includes recent work and an updated biography, provides a sweeping overview of Newman's illustrious career. The author: Philip Brookmanis curator of photography and media art at the Corcoran Gallery of Art, Washington. Brookman's projects include the exhibition and book Half Past Autumn: The Art of Gordon Parks, and the touring exhibitions and books Raised by Wolves: Photographs and Documents by Jim Goldberg, and Hospice: A Photographic Inquiry for the Corcoran Gallery.	2006-08-01	Taschen						ZZZ000000

9780849313974	Electromagnetics	Edward J. Rothwell&Michael J. Cloud		Between a first undergraduate course in electromagnetism (EM) and the advanced graduate course lies a middle ground that is essential to engineering students yet virtually ignored by most curricula. It is the transition from the basic, more superficial treatments to the sharply focused graduate studies that solidifies students' understanding of EM fundamentals before they move on to a specialized area of research. And it is here that academia-and practitioners still uneasy about the fundamentals-have lacked the appropriate "intermediate" text.Electromagnetics provides that transition. Emphasizing concepts over problem-solving techniques, it focuses on the topics most important to EM research and those most troublesome to beginning graduate students. In Part I, the authors cover the required mathematics background and introduce the primary physical principles. From a well-posed postulate, Part II builds a complete description of the EM field in free space, and Part III completes the study by investigating the behavior of the EM field in a variety of materials. Stressing both a physical understanding and a detailed mathematical description of each topic, this text provides an account of EM theory that is in-depth, lucid, and accessible.Highly engaging prose, clear, concise explanations, and numerous examples relating concepts to modern engineering applications create a comfortable atmosphere that enhances the reader's grasp of the material. Electromagnetics thus builds a foundation that allows readers to proceed with confidence to advanced EM studies, research, and applications.	2001	CRC Press						ZZZ000000

9780500279649	The royal palaces of India	George Michell&Antonio Martinelli		As early as the fourteenth century, stories glorifying the exotic palaces of Indian rulers began to circulate in the West, stories which closer acquaintance only confirmed. Even today, they are magical places -- small towns rather than single buildings, in which the Hindu and Muslim rulers of the subcontinent dispensed their laws and enjoyed their wealth.The beauty and atmosphere of these palaces are displayed here in Antonio Martinelli's exceptional color photographs. George Michell, a recognized authority on Indian architecture and art, tells the story of the palaces. He evokes life within the complexes and describes their many elements: defenses, spacious audience halls and courtyards, temples and mosques, private apartments and service quarters.These fascinating edifices are receiving increasing numbers of visitors each year, yet there has been no in-depth survey of them since 1925. Here is a superb record of the palaces, living witnesses to a regal aspiration to recreate heaven on earth.	1999-07-30	Thames & Hudson						ZZZ000000

Nestled against this impressive backdrop are the imperial cities--Fez, Meknes, Rabat, and Marrakech--whose splendor bears witness to the magnificence of the sultans of yesteryear.SOUKS: A FEAST FOR THE SENSESThe souk--the market at the heart of every medina--is a world unto itself, where enchanting colors, sounds, scents, and materials rouse the senses. Narrow, labyrinthine streets are lined with stalls and shops offering the finest in Moroccan craftsmanship: the carpets, pottery, ceramic tiles, lanterns, and ornate woodwork that are all part of the country's rich heritage.INTERIORS: ORIENTAL REFINEMENTThe most impressive Moroccan interiors are to be found in the protected world of riads and dars. Their high outer walls barely hint at the inner splendors hidden within: this is a realm reserved to a select few. Sumptuous rooms lead onto terraces, built around an inner garden or courtyard filled with orange trees and fountains. Herein lies the Orient's timeless image as a Garden of Eden.RENDEZVOUS: DARS, RIADS, AND LEGENDARY HOTELSOne of Morocco's charms lies in its unique hospitality, which views every visitor as a special guest. Whether you choose to rent a riad to experience Morocco as a resident, opt for the elegance of a celebrated hotel, or prefer a more discreet stop in an oasis at the edge of the desert, you will discover the magic and romance that are an integral part of the uniquely generous Moroccan way of life.From its spectacular mountain ranges to its boundless stretches of amber desert and beautiful coastline, Morocco offers an unparalleled panorama for the greedy eye. The intense peacefulness of the country's natural environment contrasts sharply with the bustle of its cities, which overflow with street-life: the "red city" of Marrakech, enchanted Fez, the Atlantic ports of Rabat and Casablanca . . . These different sights, seemingly worlds apart from each other, are all masterfully captured by the camera and brought together in this richly illustrated volume. Living in Morocco also takes the reader beyond the imposing walls of medinas and citadels, through labyrinthine streets where traditional "souk" markets are held, and into the homes and hidden gardens of some of the country's most illustrious inhabitants. In these private oases, one can take in the sweet scent of orange trees while sipping a glass of the freshest mint tea and indulging in gourmet delicacies .	2002-11-16	Flammarion						ZZZ000000

9780679643548	Hoshruba: The Land and the Tilism	Muhammad Husain Jah		The world's first and longest magical fantasy HOSHRUBA was compiled in the Urdu language by two of its greatest prose writers. Spread over eight thousand pages, it reached the summits of popularity and acclaim never attained by any other epic in the history of Urdu literature. But the richness of its language and its length deterred translations for more than 125 years. In this first translation of this iconic fantasy by Musharraf Ali Farooqi, whose translation of THE ADVENTURES OF AMIR HAMZA was hailed by the international press as a gift to world literature, we enter the magical world of Hoshruba, conjured in the untold past by sorcerers defying the laws of God and the physical world. Filled with dazzling illusions and occult realms inhabited by powerful sorceresses and diabolic monsters, Hoshruba had a fixed life, and a designated conqueror who would use its magical key to unravel it one day. The first book of the HOSHRUBA series begins with the giant Laqa entering Hoshruba's protection, and its sorcerer emperor finding himself at war with Laqa's arch fiend, Amir Hamza the Lord of the Auspicious Planetary Conjunction, who pursues the giant with his numerous tricksters and a young prince - the yet to be known conqueror-designate of Hoshruba.

9781568583839	Comfortably numb,the inside story of Pink Floyd	Mark Blake		In July 2005 in Hyde Park, before a global audience of millions, Pink Floyd performed together on stage for the first time in 24 years. From the moment the metronomic pulse of a heartbeat thudded out to begin "Speak to Me" to the soaring guitar solo that climaxed "Comfortably Numb," these self-effacing men in their late fifties stole the show. Almost a year later, the death of their troubled founder-member Syd Barrett made headline news worldwide. Both events signaled a kind of closure to the remarkable tale of one of the world's biggest bands. Now, in the first full-length history of the group for more than fifteen years, Mark Blake tells the story of how a group of middle-class Englishmen conquered the world. Drawing on his own interviews with all of the band members, interviews with the group's friends, road crew, producers, former housemates and university colleagues, as well as musical contemporaries including Pete Townshend and Alice Cooper, Comfortably Numb follows Pink Floyd all the way from the early psychedelic nights at UFO in the mid-sixties to the stadium-rock and concept-album zenith of the seventies, and finally the acrimonious schism that sundered the band in the '80s and '90s.	2008	Thunder's Mouth Press						ZZZ000000

9780812931273	Comeback,how seven straight-shooting CEOs turned around troubled companies	Martin Puris		The seven leaders profiled in Comeback have two things in common: They brought their companies back from the dead, and they did it by seeking out the truth and sharing it with their employees. Martin Puris believes that this instinct for the truth is essential to leadership. And he should know. He has built one of the best advertising companies in the country, having led campaigns for BMW, Burger King, UPS, and Club Med. In addition to being a writer and a CEO, Puris was an adviser to President George Bush. Now, he's gained rare access to seven inspiring leaders and their stories about thriving under extreme business pressure. Puris presents intimate portraits of chief executives at Compaq, Continental Airlines, Honeywell, Adidas, Chrysler, U.S. Surgical, and UPS. All these companies had veered dangerously off course, and it took the efforts of these seven straight-shooting CEOs to set them right. Oz Nelson did it by convincing UPS to embrace new technologies. Gordon Bethune did it by giving across-the-board bonuses to Continental employees for improvements in customer satisfaction. Michael Bonsignore did it with a level of candor most executives never approach: He told Honeywell employees their company would be sold out from under their feet if things didn't change. Martin Puris takes us inside the offices of these talented executives to present seven intimate stories of resurrection and leadership at its best.	1999-01-26	Times Business						ZZZ000000
9780812923896	Chess Mysteries of Sherlock Holmes,Fifty Tantalizing Problems of Chess Detection	Raymond M. Smullyan		Here -- from philosopher/logician/puzzlemaker Raymond Smullyan -- are fifty elegant, witty, and altogether unique "chess mysteries." In each problem the solver has to deduce certain events in a game's past. For example: On what square was the White queen captured? or, Is the White queen promoted or original?Since these problems involve the same sort of logical reasoning that lies at the core of the Sherlock Holmes stories, Raymond Smullyan has aptly set each one within its own Holmes-Watson dialogue. In each case Holmes, by his remarkable powers of deduction, is able to demonstrate to his awed admirers precisely what must have happened, move by move, at the "scene of the crime" -- the chess table. For example: what the missing piece is; what square it should be on; whether or not either side can castle.In the second half, through a series of progressively more difficult (self-contained) chess problems, Holmes, with the reader's help, solves a mystery and a double murder -- perpetrated, of course, by Moriarty. And at the end of the book are ten bonus problems from Moriarty himself (four of them composed before the age of nine!).Chess Mysteries of Sherlock Holmes is Smullyan's challenging and witty romp through the royal game.	1994-09-06	Random House Inc						ZZZ000000

But once against the human race has grown fearful; the Starways Congress has gathered a fleet to destroy Lusitania. Jane, the evolved computer intelligence, can save the three sentient races of Lusitania. She has learned how to move ships outside the universe, and then instantly back to a different world, abolishing the light-speed limit. But it takes all the processing power available to her, and the Starways Congress is shutting down the Net, world by world. Soon Jane will not be able to move the ships. Ender's children must save her if they are to save themselves.	2001-09-27	Tor Books						ZZZ000000

9788189975661	Fiftyseven By Eight	Gupta Samira		In this stunning debut novel, Samira Gupta explores what it is to grow up in an oppressive, patriarchal environment, where one man's word is law. With powerful black-and-white phtographs, she tells a story about a personal search for identity, faith and clarity in an environment where everything is provided for and yet nothing is given. Where three generations of women live, pray and laught together, and yet each fends only for herself. With humour and great insight, Gupta paints a poignant picture of a girl trying to find herself, veering between wanting space and not needing it, between self-doubt and resilient confidence. Is the rambling 57/8 her home and safe haven, or a place that will splinter away all her individuality. Taking the reader through new roads and old lanes with perception, sensitivity, originality and wit, Gupta's is an exciting new voice to watch out for.	2009	Westland Books Pvt. Ltd						ZZZ000000
9789380032122	If It Is Sweet	Mridula Koshy		In If It Is Sweet, precisely etched characters collide, the blind suddenly seeing the blind. Mridula Koshy plumbs the chasms across which they stare, asking the question: what is it people see when they see one another? Her characters are proximate, though from vastly different class backgrounds. Servants and mistresses. Middle-class insomniacs wandering the same footpaths on which labourers wake to care for their sleepless infants. An old man, his maid, and a koodawallah, and a conversation that ends in both insight and blindness. If It is Sweet does not set out to transport the reader to another world. It is one rooted in an unsettled world; it intends to unsettle. What hardship does to the human spirit is one of the central questions asked by literature. Koshy s stories are not those maids-and-madams stories that have found poverty ennobling. Nor does she argue that poverty is a curtain so dark one cannot see past it. In The Good Mother , the middle-class woman from Manchester, in Delhi to scatter the ashes of her two young boys killed in a car accident, is clearly not safe on her side of the dark curtain. She agonizes over her failed motherhood. On the other side, in P.O.P. an old Banjara woman, resident of a bustee, laments her failed motherhood: Manish was such a good boy when he was little. But I should have known. The least little thing he did wrong he thought marked him as bad. After that, he would only do wrong. The child could never see all the space there is between black and white, good and bad. Privilege does not protect characters from degradation, nor does poverty rob them of the soul-searching that is usually the purview, in literature, of the well-off. It is in such reordering of traditional narration that these stories achieve their unity as a collection. Exhilaratingly, this is a collection that claims Delhi s place in the world. Although not all of the stories are set in Delhi it is clear that Delhi is their centre of gravity. Kotla and Klamath Falls, Oregon rest cheek to cheek and Los Angeles Sunset Blvd runs right through Connaught Place, and alongside KG Marg. Above all Koshy propels the reader amongst the lives jostling on these streets to see the dark interior of their stories illuminated briefly in their moment of contact	2009	Westland Books						ZZZ000000

9780201308815	Understanding object-oriented programming with Java	Timothy Budd		Timothy Budd, leading author, educator and researcher in the object-oriented programming community, provides a deep understanding of object-oriented programming and Java. Understanding Object-Oriented Programming with Java teaches readers why the Java language works the way it does, as opposed to many other books that focus on how Java works. Readers learn about the development decisions that went into making the Java language, and leave with a more sophisticated knowledge of Java and how it fits in the context of object-oriented programming. Throughout the text, the focus remains on teaching readers to master the necessary object-oriented programming concepts. Dr. Budd explains to the reader in clear and simple terms the fundamental principles of object-oriented programming, illustrating these principles with extensive examples from the Java standard library. In short, he thoughtfully created this book, not as a reference manual for the Java language, but as a tool for understanding Java and the object-oriented programming philosophy. Highlights: Provides several graduated example programs in Part II (i.e., cannon and pinball games) for readers to work through and successively learn object-oriented programming features. Includes extensive examples from the Java standard library so that readers can better understand the many design patterns found in the AWT, the multiple purposes for which inheritance is used in the standard classes, and more. Discusses features of Java in Part V that are important for students to understand, but not necessarily notable for their object-oriented features. Instructors have the flexibility to omit altogether, or introduce in parallel with earlier material. 0201308819B04062001	1998	Addison-Wesley						ZZZ000000

9780340692431	Latent variable models and factor analysis	David J. Bartholomew&Martin Knott		Hitherto latent variable modelling has hovered on the fringes of the statistical mainstream but if the purpose of statistics is to deal with real problems, there is every reason for it to move closer to centre stage. In the social sciences especially, latent variables are common and if they are to be handled in a truly scientific manner, statistical theory must be developed to include them. This book aims to show how that should be done.This second edition is a complete re-working of the book of the same name which appeared in the Griffin's Statistical Monographs in 1987. Since then there has been a surge of interest in latent variable methods which has necessitated a radical revision of the material but the prime object of the book remains the same. It provides a unified and coherent treatment of the field from a statistical perspective. This is achieved by setting up a sufficiently general framework to enable the derivation of the commonly used models. The subsequent analysis is then done wholly within the realm of probability calculus and the theory of statistical inference. Numerical examples are provided as well as the software to carry them out ( where this is not otherwise available). Additional data sets are provided in some cases so that the reader can aquire a wider experience of analysis and interpretation.	1999	Arnold						ZZZ000000

9780684853512	Hearts in Atlantis	Stephen King		Stephen King, whose first novel, Carrie, was published in 1974, the year before the last U.S. troops withdrew from Vietnam, is the first hugely popular writer of the TV generation. Images from that war -- and the protests against it -- had flooded America's living rooms for a decade. Hearts in Atlantis, King's newest fiction, is composed of five interconnected, sequential narratives, set in the years from 1960 to 1999. Each story is deeply rooted in the sixties, and each is haunted by the Vietnam War.In Part One, "Low Men in Yellow Coats," eleven-year-old Bobby Garfield discovers a world of predatory malice in his own neighborhood. He also discovers that adults are sometimes not rescuers but at the heart of the terror.In the title story, a bunch of college kids get hooked on a card game, discover the possibility of protest...and confront their own collective heart of darkness, where laughter may be no more than the thinly disguised cry of the beast.In "Blind Willie" and "Why We're in Vietnam," two men who grew up with Bobby in suburban Connecticut try to fill the emptiness of the post-Vietnam era in an America which sometimes seems as hollow -- and as haunted -- as their own lives.And in "Heavenly Shades of Night Are Falling," this remarkable book's denouement, Bobby returns to his hometown where one final secret, the hope of redemption, and his heart's desire may await him.Full of danger, full of suspense, most of all full of heart, Stephen King's new book will take some readers to a place they have never been...and others to a place they have never been able to completely leave.	1999-09-14	Scribner						ZZZ000000

9780670057955	The Future Of Competition: Co-Creating Unique Value With Customers	C. K. Prahalad&Venkat Ramaswamy		Consumers have greater product variety today than ever, yet they are less satisfied. Top management has more strategic options, yet they deliver less value. What do these paradoxes suggest about the future of competition? C.K. Prahalad, co-author of the landmark bestseller Competing for the Future, and Venkat Ramaswamy argue that we are on the cusp of a very different world one in which the distinct roles of firm and consumer converge and the sources of value creation change dramatically. Prahalad and Ramaswamy show that the traditional, firm-centric view of value creation is being challenged by active, connected, and informed consumers coupled with the mingling of technologies and industries. No longer does value lie in products and services created by firms and delivered to customers. Increasingly, say the authors, value is being jointly created by the consumer and the company. In this framework, consumer-company interactions and personalized co-creation experiences enabled by technical and social infrastructures allow each consumer to co-create unique value with a network of companies and consumer communities. To compete effectively, CEOs and senior managers must focus on building new strategic capital. This involves enabling managers to enhance their effectiveness by experiencing the business consumers do. This book sets the agenda for top management for co-creating the future, by revealing unprecedented opportunities for value creation and innovation.	2004-01-01	Penguin Books India						ZZZ000000
9780143031925	Can Asians Think? Understanding The Divide Between East And West	Kishore Mahbubani		Can Asians think? Is Western civilization universal? Does the West promote human rights for altruistic reasons? These are some questions Kishore Mahbubani has sought to answer in this volume of essays written over the past decade.

Asian civilizations, by moving from Western models to those evolved from their own rich heritage, are beginning to contribute to the development and growth of mankind in the measure that one one would expect from there large and diverse continent. Mahbubani, hailed as 'an Asian Toynbee' and 'the Max Weber of the new Confucian ethic', continues to illuminate his central arguments, in this revised and updated edition, adding two new essays on power, responsibility and the United Nations.	2004	Penguin Books India						ZZZ000000

As she talks with policemen, a unionizer of eunuchs, and with the hijras themselves, Jaffrey unravels veils of rumor and deception to locate the nature of our sexual and social thresholds, and the people who dwell on them. Deeply resonant, uniquely insightful,The Invisiblesis an enthralling work. "A magnificent journey. Jaffrey writes about this fascinating and delicate subject with human understanding and warmth."--Ryszard Kapuscinski "Sensitively written...eloquent...and compassionate."--New York Times Book Review	1998-02-17	Vintage Departures						ZZZ000000

9780394746494	Reading the news,a Pantheon guide to popular culture	Robert Karl Manoff&Michael Schudson		We take our news for granted: that it will inform us about the significant people and cite the authoritative ones, reflect the world the way it is, and tell us why something happens as it does. Now, six working journalists, press critics, and scholars at the leading edge of media criticism have been specially commissioned to make the familiar act of reading the news into a fresh and revealing event. Taking the famous "five W's and an H" (Who, What, When, Where, Why, and How), the authors turn these questions back on journalism for the first time to show us exactly what to make of the press. Leon V. Sigal Who? Sources Make the News Carlin Romano What? Grisly Truth about Bare Facts Michael Schudson When? Deadlines, Datelines, and History Where?

9780679725244	Selected Tales	Edgar Allan Poe		Read throughout the world, admired by Dostoevsky and translated by Baudelaire, Edgar Allan Poe has become a legendary figure, representing the artist as obsessed outcast and romantic failure. His nightmarish visions, shaped by cool artistic calculation, reveal some of the dark possibilities of human experience. But his enormous popularity and his continuing influence on literature depend less on legend or vision than on his stylistic accomplishments as a writer. The tales in this volume include Poe's best-known and most representative works as well as his masterly "The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym."For the first time, the authoritative editions of works by major American novelists, poets, scholars, and essayists collected in the hardcover volumes of The Library of America are being published singly in a series of handsome paperback books. A distinguished writer has contributed an introduction for each volume, which also includes a chronology of the author's life and career, an essay on the text, and notes.	1991-09-03	Vintage Books/Library of America						ZZZ000000

His trek across the disintegrating South brings him into intimate and sometimes lethal converse with slaves and marauders, bounty hunters and witches, both helpful and malign. At the same time, the intrepid Ada is trying to revive her father' s derelict farm and learning to survive in a world where the old certainties have been swept away. As it interweaves their stories, "Cold Mountain" asserts itself as an authentic odyssey, hugely powerful, majestically lovely, and keenly moving.	1997	Vintage Books						ZZZ000000

A load of heroin and two million dollars in cash are still in the back. When Moss takes the money, he sets off a chain reaction of catastrophic violence that not even the law - in the person of aging, disillusioned Sheriff Bell - can contain. As Moss tries to evade his pursuers - in particular a mysterious mastermind who flips coins for human lives - McCarthy simultaneously strips down the American crime novel and broadens its concerns to encompass themes as ancient as the Bible and as bloodily contemporary as this morning's headlines.	2006	Vintage						ZZZ000000

9780099483748	The commonwealth of thieves	Thomas Keneally		In late-18th-century Britain, people were hanged for petty offences, yet crime was rife. The gaols were bursting and over-flow prisoners were kept in notorious 'hulks': rotting old ships moored offshore. Out of this situation was born the 'solution' - 'The Sydney Experiment': criminals perceived to 'damage' British society would be transported to Australia. Thus Sydney was founded as 'an open-air prison' with 'walls 14,000 miles thick'. There were orgies, diseases, court marshalls, hangings, escapes and hunger ... Tom Keneally tells the fascinating story of how Governor Arthur Phillip, despotic ruler of New South Wales, imposed order between the convicts, sailors and native aboriginal tribespeople... and how the 'open-air prison' eventually developed into one of the most vibrant cities in the world.	2007-06-07	Vintage						ZZZ000000

9781844133086	The Middle Sea,A History of the Mediterranean	John Julius Norwich		A one-volume narrative history of the Mediterranean from Ancient Egypt to 1919. This magnificent undertaking tackles a vast subject vast in time (from the oldest surviving pyramid to the First World War); vast in geography (from Gibraltar to Jerusalem); and vast in culture, including as it does the civilizations of the Phoenicians, the Ancient Egyptians, Greece, Carthage, Rome, Byzantium, as well as the Borgias and the Medicis, Mohammed and El Cid, Napoleon and Nelson, Moslems, Jews and Christians. The Middle Seais not a dry record of facts; it is a rackety read about historical figures dissolute Popes and wily Emperors, noble-hearted Generals and beautiful Princesses. But the author's greatest strength is naval and military history: from the Crusades to the expulsion of the Moors from Spain; from Trafalgar to Gallipoli. Towns are besieged and sacked, Kingdoms are won and lost. The narrative covers the glories of Constantinople and Venice, and the stirring history of the islands of the Mediterranean Malta, Sicily, Crete and Cyprus. The Middle Seais the culmination of John Julius Norwich's long and distinguished career as one of the greatest enthusiasts for anecdotal history, and the highways and byways of scholarship.	2007-08-07	Vintage Books						ZZZ000000
9780099481294	Unaccompanied women,late-life adventures in love, sex, and real estate	Jane Juska		As a result of what she calls 'the only stroke of genius I've ever had', Jane Juska placed a personal ad in a newspaper, that began: 'Before I turn 67 next March I would like to have a lot of sex with a man I like.' The response was overwhelming, and it changed Jane's life. She told all in A ROUND-HEELED WOMAN, which Lynne Truss called 'the best book about sex I have read', and which shocked some, amused many and became a bestseller. Five years later, Jane has, like it or not, become a kind of icon for the post-menopause generation. She's a friend and confessor to women of all ages with poignant, tragic or enchanting stories unaccompanied women, alone for now but searching for sex and romance. And despite her success, Jane herself is still looking for a man to keep her company not a husband, not even a partner, but the perfect lover, described by Katharine Hepburn as one who 'lives nearby and visits often'. So the story continues, looking around at her generation, back to her youth, and forward to... whatever grabs her fancy. And like many unaccompanied women, Jane's also in search of a better place to live. Her current tiny apartment doesn't allow for much in the way of romance, let alone the giant toy box she wants to fill for her granddaughter, born on her birthday and now just two, who's brought another kind of love to her life. But as a sporadic earner on a teacher's pension, she can never afford the dream house. So the search continues, for love, friendship, sex, a roof over her head it's what keeps this seventy-two year old author young, and will keep readers wonderfully entertained in this funny, deft and touching memoir.	2007-07-05	Vintage						ZZZ000000
9780099526391	1759,The Year Britain Became Master of the World	Frank McLynn		Although 1759 is not a date as well known in British history as 1215, 1588, or 1688, there is a strong case to be made that it is the most significant year since 1066. In the two great battles of 1759, Britain effectively beat France for global supremacy and founded the first British Empire. From the almost uninterrupted series of victories that year came momentous consequences. Victory in the East, in India and the Philippines, which in turn led to the colonisation of Australia and New Zealand. Victory in North America secured Canada for the empire and, by removing the French, created the conditions which inspired American rebellion. Until now, the story of the causes and consequences of The Seven Years War (1756-63) has been largely obscured. As Thackeray famously remarked in Barry Lindon, it would take a theologian, rather than an historian, to unravel the true causes. Drawing on a mass of primary materials - from texts in the Vatican archives to oral histories of the North American Indians - Frank McLynn shows how the conflict between Britain and France triggered the first 'world war', raging from Europe to Africa; the Caribbean to the Pacific; the plains of the Ganges to the Great Lakes of North America, and also brought about the War of Independence, the acquisition by Britain of the Falkland Islands and ultimately, The French Revolution.	2008-03-27	Vintage						ZZZ000000
9780099532330	Reappraisals,Reflections on the Forgotten Twentieth Century	Tony Judt		As Tony Judt argues persuasively in Reappraisals, we have entered an "age of forgetting." Today's world is so utterly unlike the world of just twenty years ago that we have set aside our immediate past even before we could make sense of it. We literally don't know where we came from, and the results of this burgeoning ignorance are proving calamitous, with the clear prospect of worse to come. We have lost touch with three generations of international policy debate, social thought and public-spirited social activism. We no longer know how to discuss such concepts and we have forgotten the role once played by intellectuals in debating, transmitting and defending the ideas that shaped their time. In Reappraisals, Tony Judt resurrects key aspects of the world we have lost and reminds us how important they still are to us: now and to our hopes for the future. Judt draws provocative connections between a dazzling range of subjects, from the history of the neglect and recovery of the Holocaust and the challenge of 'evil' in understanding the European past, to the rise and fall of the state in public affairs and the displacement of history by 'heritage'.Ranging with his trademark acuity and 'lan from Belgium to Israel, from the memory of Marxism to the practice of foreign policy, he takes us beyond what we think we know to show us how we came to know it, and reveals how much of our history has been sacrificed in the triumph of myth-making over understanding and denial over memory. His book is a road map back to the historical sense we urgently need.	2009-02-05	Vintage						ZZZ000000
9780099522973	Medici,Godfathers of the Renaissance	Paul Strathern		Vivid and dramatic, this is a dazzling history of the modest family which rose to become one of the most powerful in Europe. The Mediciis a remarkably modern story of power, money and ambition. Against the background of an age which saw the rebirth of ancient and classical learning, Paul Strathern explores the intensely dramatic rise and fall of the Medici family in Florence, as well as the Italian Renaissance which they did so much to sponsor and encourage. Interwoven into the narrative are the lives of many of the great Renaissance artists with whom the Medici had dealings, including Leonardo, Michelangelo and Donatello, as well as scientists like Galileo and Pico della Mirandola, both of whom clashed with the religious authorities. In his enthralling study, Strathern also follows the fortunes of those members of the Medici family who achieved success away from Florence, including the two Medici popes and Catherine de Medici, who became Queen of France and played a major role in that country through three turbulent reigns. Vivid and accessible, the book ends with the gloriously decadent decline of the Medici family in Florence as they strove to be recognized as European princes.	2007	VINTAGE						ZZZ000000

9780753516898	I Am America (and So Can You!)	Stephen Colbert		Stephen Colbert was The Daily Show's longest-running and most memorable correspondent. His right-wing, super-patriotic persona, his insight and general rightness led to The Colbert Report, a half-hour TV platform for his views on the issues of the day and, more importantly, why everyone else's views are just plain wrong. I Am America (And So Can You!) features Stephen's most deeply held knee-jerk beliefs on everything from The Family to Race and Immigration and provides the ultimate satirical guide to the glorious marvel that is American Life. He bravely takes on the forces aligned to destroy America whether they be terrorists, environmentalists, or brand-name breakfast cereals and tackles difficult issues like religion, sexuality, and nature ('I've never trusted the sea. What's it hiding under there?') With hilarious illustrations and charts ('Things That Are Trying to Turn Me Gay', 'Sports to Ignore' and many more) and a complete transcript of Colbert's infamous speech at the 2006 White House Correspondents' Dinner, this is a brilliant read as well as a very clever commentary on America today.	2009-01-08	Virgin Books						HUM000000

The effects of homeopathy dont go away under rigorous scientific conditions. Thirty years on, no one has an explanation for a seemingly intelligent signal received from outer space. The speed of light seems to have changed over the lifetime of the universe. The US Department of Energy is re-examining cold fusion (a nuclear reaction in which atoms release more energy than they consume) because the evidence is too solid to ignore. The placebo effect is put to work in medicine while doctors cant agree on whether it even existsIn an age when science is supposed to be king, scientists are beset by experimental results they simply cannot explain. But, if the past is anything to go by, these anomalies contain the seeds of future scientific revolutions.This mind-boggling but entirely accessible survey of the outer-limits of human knowledge is based on a short article Michael Brooks wrote for the New Scientist in 2005. It became the most circulated New Scientist feature ever.

The exercises and puzzles are intriguing challenges; the self-tests offer many opportunities to rate your social intelligence, take your personality inventory, and gauge working memory. nbsp; For anyone interested in self-improvement and in how the brain really works,Building Mental Muscleis essential reading. nbsp; Some of the research findings inBuilding Mental Muscleinclude: nbsp; * The simple lifestyle changes that can boost the rate at which your brain grows neurons to keep your memory sharp * Ways to trick your emotional brain into storing new information permanently and how to retrieve it from memory when needed * How women's and men's brains process information differently * How brains respond to stress, solve problems, recognize faces, and handle fear * The discovery of a hitherto unknown class of receptor cells in your eyes that your brain uses to set its own internal clock * How to change your mood without drugs or therapy * What you can do to combat or even reverse the gradual decline of cognitive skills as you age nbsp; Your doctor may not have read about some of the research findings in this book.	2003-10-17	Walker & Company						ZZZ000000
9780802715692	The cosmic verses,a rhyming history of the universe	James Muirden&David Eccles		From mankind's ancestors to Professor Stephen Hawking, James Muirden cleverly and humorously examines our quest to make sense of the cosmos in wonderful rhyming couplets. If you've ever wondered about the universe, or wanted to broaden your horizons, here are the theories, discoveries, writings and sayings of Aristotle, Plato and Pythagoras, Ptolemy, and the Arab astronomers and mathematicians who flourished during Europe's Dark Ages, Copernicus, Galileo, Newton, Boyle and many more by way of Einstein and so to the present day...and now the education is fun! Here also are the thoughts of space scientists, alchemists, writers, and theologians all weighing in on the cosmos as, through Muirden's delightful presentation, he spins the history of science on a new axis. Here's a short excerpt from "The Cosmic Verses": Pythagoras thought the world a sphere, (a new and startling idea!), but his enduring claim to fame is through the proof that bears his name. Draw any triangle that you dare, one corner being nice and square: the shorter sides call a and b, the long hypotenuse call c...then c2 equals you will find, the squares of a and b combined. James Muirden has written some thirty books on astronomy and space, in addition to A "Rhyming History of Britain" and "Shakespeare Well-Versed." He has also been a film reviewer and telescope maker. He lives with his wife and children in Devon, England. From mankind's ancestors to Professor Stephen Hawking, James Muirden's rhyming couplets examine the quest to make sense of the cosmos. His verses present the theories, discoveries, writings and sayings of Aristotle, Plato and Pythagoras, Ptolemy, and the Arab astronomers and mathematicians who flourished during Europe's Dark Ages, Copernicus, Galileo, Newton, Boyle and many more by way of Einstein and so to the present day. Here also are the thoughts of space scientists, alchemists, writers, and theologians all weighing in on the cosmos as, through Muirden's presentation, he spins the history of science on a new axis. Here is a short excerpt from "The Cosmic Verses": Pythagoras thought the world a sphere, (a new and startling idea!), but his enduring claim to fameis through the proof that bears his name. Draw any triangle that you dare, one corner being nice and square: the shorter sides call a and b, the long hypotenuse call c . . . then c2 equals you will find, the squares of a and b combined. "From English history and literature Muirden turns his humorous muse to a far fitter task. He has some 30 books on astronomy and space already on his resume, so one more on the science that subsumes those topics, cosmology, should be a mere bagatelle. And so it is, though like Beethoven's piano bagatelles, weighty as well as light. The weight is inherent to the subject, which Muirden traces from Neolithic cave painters' possible heavy thinking on the stars to the radiation discovered by Stephen Hawking, which, emitted by black holes, is a ponderous product, indeed. The lightness is conferred by Muirden's rattling iambic tetrameter couplets, relieved yet abetted by sidebars of linked limericks, ballad stanzas, and other jigging forms on such matters as epicycles, the "punctum equans" ("Ptolemy's fix"), Kepler's first two laws, Newton's law of gravity, and the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. And then there are David Eccles' airy cartoon illustrations to keep things positively floating."--Ray Olson, "Booklist" "This latest volume of didactic verse from the author of "A Rhyming History of Britain" brings Muirden's knack for the explanatory couplet to the history of astronomy. Using mainly iambic tetrameter--spiked with the occasional limerick and aided by Eccles's charming cartoons--Muirden traces the study of the cosmos from Cro-Magnon times to the present. Even when the science is knotty, readers will marvel at Muirden's ability to rhyme almost anything-including Einstein's general theory of relativity ('But nobody was then prepared/For e to = mc2'). Muirden places the science within its historical context; plenty of rhymes address the formidable role the Church played in furthering (or thwarting) the pursuit of scientific knowledge, and if lay readers close this book with a still-incomplete grasp of astronomy, it's likely they'll come away with a better understanding of, say, the Danish court of Tycho Brahe's time or of the intellectual climate in Baghdad in A.D. 762. For uninitiated readers seeking an introduction to astrophysics, there are more comprehensive (nonrhyming) books available. Those with a background in astronomy, however--or those who just wish to appreciate Muirden at the top of his game--will find this delightful."--"Publishers Weekly"	2007-01	Walker & Co.

9780316732888	Nobody likes you,inside the turbulent life, times, and music of Green Day	Marc Spitz		In 1994 punk rock trio Green Day were on top of the world with DOOKIE, their massive hit album. They were loud, fast, bratty, pissed off, hopeless, truthful, drunk, maybe high, and somehow, absolutely massive. It was glorious.But by 2004, the hoopla seemed to be over. The band were still respected by up-and-coming bands, but their album sales were down. And then, in October 04, came a new album, American Idiot. A furious and impassioned reaction against American politics - and in particular George W. Bush - American Idiot spoke directly to millions of people around the globe. Once again Green Day were reaching pissed off, disaffected teenagers as well as millions of older fans.Few bands achieve Green Day's early success, and even fewer come back for an even more explosive second act. Highly respected rock journalist Marc Spitz has interviewed the band many times, and has won their respect. His book will be the definitive history of the band.	2007-12-06	Little, Brown Book Group Limited						ZZZ000000
9780316640510	Pulse,the next frontier	Robert Frenay		Bridges made with spider silk; ships that swim like fish; rubber as supple as a dragonfly's wing hellip; innovations like these are at the forefront of the concept of 'the new biology'. A way of using nature as a model for human designs, the new biology is a growing force in many different fields, and will have enormous impact on the development of the twenty-first century. Companies like IBM, Volvo and AT&T are already exploring how we can learn from and use properties that exist in nature, and how to improve cost- efficiency by using concepts like 'design for disassembly', whereby each component of a product can be recycled at the end of the product's natural life. Waste products, too, are increasingly being used as raw materials, so one industry's rubbish is another's power. Creating 'industrial ecologies' like these lies at the heart of the new biology: a new way of thinking for a new millennium. The essential introduction to this idea, PULSE is a fascinating look at how we might be living in the twenty-first century.	2006-12-07	Little, Brown						ZZZ000000

9780316730204	The Writing on the Wall,China and the West in the 21st Century	Will Hutton		The prevailing view of China is of an economic juggernaut set to make the 21st century its own. This provocative and stimulating book warns instead that China is running up against a set of daunting challenges from within that could well derail its rise and, in turn, deliver a crippling shock to the global economy. Britain, Europe and the US must recognise that they have a vital stake in assuring that collapse does not happen.China's effect on our lives is reflected in our house prices, the inequality in our wages and the prices we pay in our shops. Yet China is burdened by a weak enterprise system, growing social protest and environmental degradation. Hutton shows how the contradictions of an authoritarian state are fundamentally disabling and argues that if China is to complete the transition to capitalism upon which it has embarked, it has no choice but to embrace the mechanisms that make business and government accountable to people - from a free press to representative governance. This is a powerful warning that global peace and prosperity depend upon successful transition.	2007-01-18	Little, Brown						ZZZ000000
9780316732482	Immigrants,your country needs them	Philippe Legrain		Immigration divides our globalising world like no other issue. We are swamped by bogus asylum-seekers and infiltrated by terrorists, our jobs stolen, our benefit system abused, our way of life destroyed - or so we are told. Philippe Legrain, author of the critically acclaimed OPEN WORLD, has written the first book that looks beyond the headlines. Why are ever-rising numbers of people from poor countries arriving in Europe, North America and Australasia? Can we keep them out? Should we even be trying? Combining compelling first-hand reporting from around the world, incisive socio-economic analysis and a broad understanding of what is at stake politically and culturally, IMMIGRANTS is a passionate, but lucid book. In our open world, more people will inevitably move across borders, Legrain says - and we should generally welcome them. They do the jobs we can't or won't do - and their diversity enriches us all. Left and right; free-marketeers and campaigners for global justice; enlightened patriots - all should rally behind the cause of freer migration, because They need Us and We need Them.	2007-01-30	Little, Brown						ZZZ000000

Over the course of more than four decades, he has become one of our foremost observers of the Oval Office - a reporter whose unparalleled contacts and access have created countless scoops, a writer whose nuanced insights into the complex interplay of personality and power at the highest level have brought us a deeper understanding of our government. Now Sidey has collected his memories, anecdotes and reflections on America's 12 most recent Presidents - from Franklin D. Roosevelt to George W Bush - in one volume. At the heart of the book is a fresh portrait of each President, based on Sidey's unique insider's view of these multi-faceted men. In these pages, after a lifetime of what Sidey calls " President-watching," the veteran journalist shares his unvarnished opinion of such unforgettable individuals as John F Kennedy, Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan - whose sports broadcasts Sidey listened to on the radio as a smalltown Iowa boy. Sidey has also reviewed his archives and written fresh introductions to vintage columns that shed further light on each President. In addition, the book features a pictorial biography of each president, as well as a picture gallery capturing the major events of his term in office. To complement Sidey's matchless anecdotes, Time's editors have chosen hundreds of photographs that offer a surprising, fresh view of American Presidents, their families and life on what Sidey terms " the White House stage. " From Dwight Eisenhower flipping flapjacks in a Colorado bunkhouse to Franklin Roosevelt and his inner circle dressing up as members of a Roman imperial court, this richly visual volume will find an honored place on bookshelves.	2004-09-07	Time Books						ZZZ000000

9780446613989	Born to Steal,When the Mafia Hit Wall Street	Gary Weiss		One day Louis Pasciuto was pumping gas. The next day he was pumping stocks on Wall Street-another brass-balled young hoodlum in an off-the-rack suit, persuading rich and gullible investors to buy phony stocks over the phone. But while Louis was raking in thousands of dollars a day and pouring it out on orgies and Armanis, someone else had his eyes on him... By the early 1990s the mob had its teeth sunk deep into the Bull Market, and phony, boiler-room stock hustlers like Louis were perfect prey. With a cocaine habit, a stripper girlfriend, and a Ferrari to go along with his straitlaced Staten Island fiancee, Louis was in way over his head-and a hungry mobster was at the door.

9780297607373	Napoleon	Paul Johnson		This concise biography is written with great wit and panache, but also has a serious purpose: to make us face up to the moral bankruptcy of Napoleon's dictatorship. Johnson tells the whole story: his astonishing gift for figures and calculation, his mastery of cannon; his audacious, hyperactive and aggressive generalship and his simple battle tactics; his complete control of propaganda and the success of the cultural presentation of the Empire; the Code Napoleon; his failure as an international statesman, as Europe grew to hate him; his marshals and ministers; his wives, mistresses, personal style and working methods; the British blockade and the Continental System; the mistakes in Spain and Russia. The escape from Elba, the events leading up to Waterloo and the battle itself, which gets a full treatment, is particularly riveting.	2002-07-25	Weidenfeld & Nicolson						ZZZ000000
9780304366798	The Big Book of Sex "Quotes",1001 Quips and Quotes	Julian L'Estrange		"When authorities remind you of the sinfulness of sex, there is an important lesson to be learned. Do not have sex with the authorities."--Matt Groening (The Simpsons). Prudes beware: there are no repressive authorities or censors here. From Aphrodisiacs to Rude Food, Virginity to Viagra, these 1001 unexpurgated sex quotes--divided into 75 categories--are too good to keep under cover. As with every volume in the popular "Big Book" series, the seductive array of material covers a wide span, and nothing is too hot to handle. Some are fresh off the press: "Study Finds Sex-Pregnancy Link" trumpets one newspaper headline. (Who knew?) Others come from our finest comic geniuses, such as Woody Allen's "Sex without love is an empty experience, but as empty experiences go, it's one of the best." Whether it's Mae West's sassy "To err is human--but it feels divine" or Andy Warhol's surprising "Sex is the biggest nothing of all time," these are entertaining and amazing.	2005-01-28	Cassell Guides						ZZZ000000

9780297852292	China shakes the world,the rise of a hungry nation	James Kynge		"This book elucidates China's rise from the inside out. It describes the people and the places behind the transformation of the world's most populous nation and shows how the emergence of an outsized appetite is convulsing the world. China Shakes the World recognises the manifold strengths of an industrializing power, but it also shows that not all Chinese graphs point upward. In fact, many of the influences felt in Europe and America are the manifestations of profound weaknesses." "Ultimately, though, the question raised by China's ascent comes down to compatibility. Can the West accommodate a country that is in its character and convictions very different from the world created under Pax Americana since the end of World War Two?"--BOOK JACKET.	2006-04-27	Weidenfeld & Nicolson						ZZZ000000

9780297852452	China shakes the world,the rise of a hungry nation	James Kynge		We have long been looking for a book on the new China, the nation that in 25 years has changed beyond all recognition, becoming an industrial powerhouse for the world. James Kynge, China Bureau Chief of the Financial Times since 1998, will, by July, complete a book that shows not only the extraordinary rise of the Chinese economy, but what the future holds as China begins to influence the world. This is the book for anyone who wants to understand this astonishing turn-round.On the eve of the British industrial revolution some 230 years ago, China accounted for one third of the global economy. In 1979, after 30 years of Communism, its economy contributed only two per cent to global GDP. Now it is back up to five per cent, and rising. As Kynge says, although China is already a palpable force in the world, its re-emergence is only just starting to be felt. Over the next decade the hunger for foreign jobs, raw materials, energy and food will reshape world trade, capital flows and politics. The outflow of Chinese manufactured products, tourists, students, corporate and personal investments will be felt keenly in some parts.Kynge also shows China's weaknesses - its environmental pollution, its crisis in social trust, its weak financial system and the faltering institutions of its governments - which are poised to have disruptive effects on the world. The fall-out from any failure in China's rush to modernity or simply from a temporary economic crash in the Chinese economy would be felt around the world.	2006-04-12	Weidenfeld & Nicolson						ZZZ000000
9780297851349	The wind from the east	Almudena Grandes		In a small seaside suburb two strangers arrive - Juan Olmedo, accompanied by his mentally disabled brother and his young niece, and Sara Gomez, an enigmatic woman in her fifties. Both have their reasons for fleeing the city. Sara's father had returned from the Civil war a broken man, unable to support his family. In desperation, her mother was forced to give up the young baby to her childless employer. Growing up amidst a background that would never truly be her own, Sara was forever caught between her love of the good life and her feelings of duty towards a family and a poverty that repelled her. Now Sara has more money than she had ever dreamed, but her freedom has come at a price.Juan also has his reasons for starting a new life. A doctor in the local ER unit, he is haunted by a tragedy in his family's past and by a secret sexual obsession that threatens the fragile equilibrium he has found in his new home.Like the capricious winds that dominate the coast, bringing chaos or clemency in their wake, the lives of these two people are pitched from fortune to adversity by forces beyond their command.	2006-07-13	Weidenfeld & Nicolson						ZZZ000000
9780297851387	H. P. Lovecraft,against world : against life	Michel Houellebecq		"Those who love life do not read. Nor do they go to the movies, actually. No matter what might be said, access to the artistic universe is more or less entirely the preserve of those who are a little fed up with the world." In this prescient work-now with an introduction by Stephen King-Michel Houellebecq, the author of the novels Platform and Atomised, focuses his considerable analytical skills on H.P. Lovecraft, the seminal, enigmatic horror writer of the early 20th century. Houellebecq's insights into the craft of writing illuminate both Lovecraft and Houellebecq's own work. The two are kindred spirits, sharing a uniquely dark worldview. But even as he outlines Lovecraft's rejection of this loathsome world, it is Houellebecq's adulation for the author that drives this work and makes it a love song, infusing the writing with an energy and passion that characterises Houellebecq's new novel. Indispensable reading for anyone interested in Lovecraft, Houellebecq, or the past and future of horror.	2006-07-31	Weidenfeld & Nicolson						ZZZ000000

9780297852537	Special assignments,the further adventures of Erast Fandorin	Boris Akunin		Two new adventures for Boris Akunin's well-loved, inimitable hero in which Erast Fandorin faces two very different adversaries: one, a deft, comedic swindler and master of disguise, whose machinations send ripples spreading through the carefully maintained calm of Moscow in 1886, and the other a brutal serial killer, driven by an insane, maniacal obsession, who strikes terror into the heart of the Moscow slums in 1889 - and who may have more in common with London's own Jack the Ripper than simply a taste for women of easy virtue. Peopled by a cast of eccentric characters, and with plots that are as surprising as they are inventive, Fandorin's 'Special Assignments' will delight Akunin's many thousands of fans, while testing their gentleman sleuth's powers of detection to the limit.	2007-01-11	Weidenfeld & Nicolson						ZZZ000000

9780297853152	A Perfect Mess (EXP/AIR/IRE),The Hidden Benefits of Disorder	Eric Abrahamson&David H. Freedman		Like the bestselling Freakonomics or Blink, here is a book that combines a professor's expertise with stories from everyday life to provide a striking new view of how our world works. Ever since Einstein's study of Brownian Motion, scientists have understood that a little disorder actually makes systems more effective. But most people still shun disorder, or suffer guilt over the mess they can't avoid. No longer! With a spectacular array of anecdotes and case studies of the useful role mess can play, here is an antidote to the accepted wisdom that tight schedules, neatness and consistency are the keys to success. Drawing on examples from business, parenting, cooking, the war on terrorism, retail and even the meteoric career of Arnold Schwarzenegger, co-authors Abrahamson and Freedman demonstrate that moderately messy systems use resources more efficiently, yield better solutions and are harder to break than neat ones. A PERFECT MESS will help readers assess what the right amount of disorder is for a given system, and how to apply these ideas on to a large scale - government or society - and on a small scale - (in your attic, kitchen or office). A PERFECT MESS will forever change the way we think about those unruly heaps of paper on our desks.	2007	Orion Publishing Group, Limited						ZZZ000000
9780297850687	Young Stalin	Sebag Montefiore		Stalin remains one of the creators of our world - like Hitler, the personification of evil. Yet Stalin hid his past and remains mysterious. This enthralling biography that reads like a thriller finally unveils the secret but extraordinary journey of the Georgian cobbler's son who became the Red Tsar. What forms such a merciless psychopath and consummate politician? Was he illegitimate? Did he owe everything to his mother - was she whore or saint? Was he a Tsarist agent or Lenin's chief gangster? Was he to blame for his wife's premature death? If he really missed the 1917 Revolution, how did he emerge so powerful?Born in poverty, exceptional in his studies, this charismatic but dangerous boy was hailed as a romantic poet, trained as a priest, but found his mission as fanatical revolutionary. The secret world of Joseph Conrad-style terrorism was Stalin's natural habitat, where he charmed his future courtiers, made the enemies he later liquidated, and abandoned his many mistresses and children. The mastermind of bank-robberies, protection-rackets, extortion, arson, piracy and murder was, uniquely, part-intellectual, part-brigand. Montefiore shows how the murderous paranoia and gangsterism of the criminal underworld, combined with pitiless ideology, taught Stalin how to triumph in the Kremlin - and create the USSR in his flawed image.Based on massive research and astonishing new evidence, YOUNG STALIN is a history of the Russian Revolution, a pre-history of the USSR - and a fascinatingly intimate biography: this is how Stalin became Stalin.	2007	Weidenfeld & Nicolson						ZZZ000000
9780297645467	Madman Dreams of Turing Machines	Janna Levin		This is a remarkable fiction debut from a young female physicist obsessed with two giants of twentieth century science: Kurt Godel, the greatest logician of the age, and Alan Turing, the breaker of the Enigma code. Janna Levin tells their parallel lives in a haunting story of tortured genius, persecution and death. Godel became delusional and paranoid to the point he starved himself to death. Turing, despite his brilliant war work, was hounded to destruction because he was homosexual. Both men devoted their lives to the highest truths of abstract nature, yet were unable to grapple with the everyday world. A MADMAN DREAMS OF TURING MACHINES is a haunting, elegaic story that flows back and forth between Turing, Godel and the author.	2007-12-28	Weidenfeld & Nicolson						ZZZ000000

A knife, bearing the initials 'CG', is thrust up to the hilt in the victim's chest, and State Counsellor Fandorin is allegedly seen fleeing the crime." "But all is not quite as it seems." "Someone is intent on framing Fandorin, and he must discover who they are, and who is really responsible for the murder. His investigation sets him on the trail of the mysterious 'CG', and brings him up against a daunting adversary: a man who bears a grudge, intent on wreaking vengeance at any cost." "As Fandorin also comes under threat from power-hungry strategists, he must fight his corner against hidden opponents - some more worthy than others. But will his feelings for a beautiful and passionate young revolutionary cloud his judgement?"--BOOK JACKET.	2008-01-10	Weidenfeld & Nicolson						ZZZ000000

9780297851202	Prehistory,the making of the human mind	Colin Renfrew		Prehistory covers human existence before written records, i.e. most of human existence. But it also refers to a field of study, the discipline through which we scrutinize prehistoric times. This book begins by looking at the gradual discovery only 150 years ago of a remote human past going back tens of thousands of years and the subsequent dramatic growth of the study of prehistory: early archaeology; geology; Darwin's ideas of evolution; cave paintings; fossil discoveries of human ancestors; museums and collections; and then in the 1950s radiocarbon dating and, in the 1980s, DNA analysis.Colin Renfrew then looks at current issues and problems in prehistory. He challenges the conventional assumption of an all-important 'human revolution' 40,000 years ago - when Homo sapiens first appeared in Europe - and suggests that the key developments were much later. The author's case-studies range widely, from Orkney to the Balkans, from the Indus Valley to Peru, from Ireland to China, and provide fresh insights even on such landmark monuments as the Egyptian pyramids and the Valley of the Kings, Stonehenge and the sacrificial burial pyramids at Teotihuacan in Mexico. The book ends with a fascinating chapter, the transition from Prehistory to History, on early writing systems.	2007	Weidenfeld & Nicolson						ZZZ000000

9788189975357	Tales From The Puffugees	Utley Jaspar		It began, as such books must often do, with the Battle of the Titans: the Club President s wife Mrs Mukherjee (whose nose, it was said, could crack open coconuts), and the indomitable General. The war of wits between this truly formidable woman, and the cheroot-smoking army man, leads to the banishment of the Puffugees to the veranda of the Club, for their unshakeable addiction to tobacco. Undeterred by the loss of the plush Club interiors, the Puffugees collect every evening, smoking and listening to the General s sometimes outrageous, but always fascinating stories. It is during these evening soirees that they journey into the General s colourful world inhabited by mad English women who turn into bears; ghosts who believe in punctuality; and, last but not least, Mrs Mukherjee s husband, who once appeared among the Puffugees wearing a burka. Witty, incredibly entertaining, and imbued with the General s peculiar brand of morality, Tales of the Puffugees is a side-splitting, unputdownable read.	2008	Westland Books Pvt. Ltd						ZZZ000000

9780761126003	God,A Companion for Seekers	David Schiller		"I am that I am," is the Old Testament quoting God directly. "God is love," says the New Testament. "God is a verb," counters Buckminster Fuller. "God is dead," claimed Nietzsche. And then there's Picasso: "God is really only another artist. He invented the giraffe, the elephant, and the cat. He has no real style. He just goes on trying other things." What are we to make of this?Compiled and edited by the author of the bestselling The Little Zen Companion and The Little Book of Prayers, God is a collection of the most compelling, surprising, witty, interesting, paradoxical, and passionate things people through the centuries have thought and said about God. It is about God's presence and God's absence, God's essence and God's attributes, God's actions and God's indifference--even God's names (in Islam there are 99 of them, while in the Jewish tradition God's name cannot even be written).Each page inspires, enlightens, provokes, reassures. Quotes come from scripture and religious leaders, philosophers and mystics, writers, artists, poets, Zen free spirits and scientists, and anonymous graffiti writers. Eclectic and ecumenical, it is a seeker's palm-sized miscellany celebrating the ineffable.	2002-10-28	Workman Pub.						ZZZ000000

9780224079150	Cricket, Lovely Cricket?,An Addict's Guide to the World's Most Exasperating Game	Lawrence Booth		Cricket, Lovely Cricket is a sports book with a difference - an original and engaging journey around the perennially curious world of cricket, leaving no metaphorical leg-break unturned and peering at the game from every conceivable angle. Here, Lawrence Booth, who had little option but to turn a youthful obsession with the gameinto a means of paying the mortgage, seeks to consider the questions that crop up on a daily basis but rarely receive a satisfactory answer. What are the players really like? What is the secret of sledging? Why get so worked up about the Ashes? Why all the cliches? And how did India take over the world? Fittingly, for a sport that can last up to five days without a result, Cricket, Lovely Cricket is all-embracing but probing, humorous but insightful, sweeping but reflective. It is underpinned by the essential - and slightly frightening - truth that cricket does not actually matter at all, yet continually finds itself relating the game to the wider world.

9788188479146	Letters To A Young Poet	Rainer Maria Rilke		A Beloved Classic Of Writerly Wisdom "Though they were written specifically to a young poet, Rilke's words apply to everyone - especially to those who are attempting to do anything creative in their lives." - Marc Allen, author of A Visionary Life  The ten letters that form this beautiful little book are some of the most famous letters ever written. They range freely over a variety of subjects, from the dangers of an ironic worldview to the value of faith. The reason they have proved to be so popular over the years is that they are the work of a great soul; an expansive and inspiring spirit pervades them.  For almost a hundred years, the voice that reached out to the aspiring artist with the most clarity and consolation was that of Rainer Maria Rilke. How is it that such a slim book, written so long ago in a time very different from our own, still speaks to us with such authority today? The answer lies in the simple fact that these letters are the result of a unique conjunction of circumstances that created an almost magical alchemy of thought and feeling.  Because of their depth of sentiment and sense of wise detachment, readers often assume that they are the work of an older man looking back on the struggles of youth. But, in fact, these letters were written between Rilke's twenty-eighth and thirty-third years - during which he was struggling to find himself artistically. However, it is the great, overarching shadow of the French sculptor Rodin that helps lift Rilke's insights from the profound observations of a sensitive and talented young man to the status of timeless utterances about the mysteries of life and the creative process.  This book makes a perfect gift for the writer, artist, or thinker.	2005-05-01	Yogi Impressions Books Pvt. Ltd.						ZZZ000000
9788188479160	Let Life Flow	Ramesh Balsekar		Meeting The Challenges Of Daily Living In A Calm, Peaceful Way  Change, unceasing change which is the very basis of life and living, is what Let Life Flow is all about. Ramesh says that life is like a deep river, flowing incessantly, whereas the day-to-day living for most people is a preference for the security and stagnancy of the little pools beside the river.  What happens in life is that the challenge is always new, but our response is old because it is formed on the past, which is memory. Experiencing with memory is one state, but experiencing without memory is altogether different. A new thought, an inspiration can happen only when the mind is not caught in the net of memory. It is only when the mind is still, tranquil, not seeking any solution, any answer, neither resisting nor avoiding, that it is capable of receiving what is true, that which is eternal, timeless, immeasurable. You cannot go to it, it comes to you; what liberates is the truth, not your effort to be free.  Ramesh uses the river as an apt metaphor for his concept that no one is a doer but, rather, all actions are happenings ordained by the One Source, who some refer to as God. To perceive ourselves as the doers is like the river thinking that it is pushing itself onwards to the sea, or the sea thinking that the tides are its own doing - totally oblivious of the fact that is the gravitational force of the moon that is responsible for their ebb and flow.  To let life flow, in general terms, means that we should go about our daily routine with a relaxed attitude, based on the total basic understanding that nothing at all can happen unless it is supposed to happen according to one's destiny, according to the Cosmic Law.	2005-06-01	Yogi Impressions Books Pvt.

9788188479115	The One In The Mirror	Ramesh S. Balsekar		See What You Truly Are!  Ramesh Balsekar's teaching is simple to grasp. He shows us the way to peace and harmony in daily living, while facing life from moment to moment. Accepting the words of the Buddha that 'Events happen, deeds are done, but there is no individual doer of any deed,' is a gateway to this peace. All actions are happenings which could not have happened unless they were ordained by the Source, which some identify as God.  In this book, Balsekar gives the essence of his teaching in short, simple passages that everyone can under-stand. Subjects covered range from 'Free Will' to 'Meditation'. The bookis a collection of individual quotes, some just a single sentence and others a few paragraphs long. Each quote, a sparkling jewel through which the teaching shines forth, is complete in itself.  Ramesh Balsekar's focus is on the 'practical' aspect of spirituality. Something to be lived each day of our lives, and not pursued as a lofty ideal. He draws the essence of his teaching from the Indian philosophy of Advaita (non-duality) which affirms that there is only 'One Source'. This book reflects the core concepts of the Advaita philosophy, placed in today's context by Balsekar, for the benefit of the reader.	2005	Yogi Impressions Books Pvt. Ltd.						ZZZ000000
