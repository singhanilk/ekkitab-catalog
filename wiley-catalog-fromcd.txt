Patterns allow experienced programmers to share patterns or nuggets of lessons learned with other programmers to help save enormous amounts of product development time and money. Patterns can be a segment of Java code that can be reused, best design practices for developing a database in Java, or project management and people skills that work time and time again for a project.Many programmers and developers want to take advantage of patterns, but don't have the time or experience to document them for their organizations. The documentation of these patterns along with practical examples has made books in this area sell so well.Patterns are usually grouped together based on the phase that they occur in a project's life cycle. There are five main stages of the software development life cycle:Requirements and Business Modeling - determine what the business needs are.Analysis - define the parameters and scope of the project.Design - begin the work on the project.Implementation - roll out the project.Testing - refine and improve the program/system. The most popular group of patterns-Design Patterns-occur in the Analysis and Design phases of the life cycle.	9/1/2006	Wiley India Pvt Ltd		English			1	ZZZ000000

9788126504985	PRINCIPLES OF NETWORK & SYSTEM ADMIN. 2nd Ed.	MARK BURGESS	Paperback	Burgess approaches both network and system administration from the perspective of principles and ideas which do not change on a day-to-day basis.A great deal of attention is paid to the heuristics of system and network administration; technical and sociological issues are taken into account equally and are presented thoughtfully with an eye to teaching not what to do as a system or network administrator, but how to think about problems that arise in practice. As a result, the author keeps the reader looking forward to what comes next and how to implement what he or she has learned.The focus is on strategic issues, how to keep systems maintainable and how to manage configuration files across an enterprise. During the 80s and most of the 90s the frontiers of system administration were about understanding what the job entailed and building tools in order to manage networks more efficiently. The next phase is about standardization of management and practice, making system administration more formal and less ad hoc, and Burgess' book is one of the first to begin to push into this area.Whilst there are multitudes of ways to become a systems administrator, many employers prefer to hire people with some formal college education. Certification and practical experience demonstrating these skills will be essential for applicants without a degree.  Systems administrators must keep their skills current and acquire new ones.1.

9788126503438	AUTOMATED MACHINES & TOOLMAKING (5th Ed.)	REX MILLER & MARK RICHARD MILLER	Paperback	All three books in this one-of-a kind, Machinists Library will undergo reorganization and update. While much of the current text and illustration materials are not overly dated, as basic machine shops have not changed that much over the years, new types of machines and methods have been introduced for different applications. New review questions will be added. The existing books have a good reputation in the industry, but have been out of stock for at least five years. Many tinkers, robot makers, mechanics and repair persons as well as home owners keep a copy of the 1983 editions, dog-eared by now, at their workbench or in their tool box.  According to the author the Machinists Library sold 250,000 copies in all editions, primarily editions 1-3. While various publishers (prior to Wiley) authorized "rewrites" and the books have gradually changed over the times, this update will be the most thorough. For instance, the switch to small electric motors for individual machines is a far cry from the old days when one huge motor-generator set was used to power an entire machine shop (as was the case in the 1st edition of the book). Readers and re-sellers have contacted the authors requesting an updated version including coverage of new machines and electronic controls.	3/2/2004	Wiley India Pvt Ltd		English			1	ZZZ000000

The thought of meetings makes most business people miserable, but they're a critical and unavoidable part of what we do. Through fictional narrative, modelling, and practical suggestions, Lencioni shows how to turn meetings from painful and tedious to productive, compelling, and even energizing. The story follows a failing executive, never much of a team player, who finds his job on the line and his future dependent on his ability to dramatically improve his disastrous meetings. An irreverent grad student comes into the picture with fresh ideas and a new perspective to help the executive turn things around. It's a quick, engrossing book that explores the keys to holding meetings that improve the morale, effectiveness, and bottom line of an organization.FlashbackPlot PointProtagonistActionResolutionThe ModelThe Paradox of MeetingsExecutive SummaryProblem #1: Lack of DramaProblem #2: Lack of Contextual StructureThe Biggest Challenge of All: The Myth of Too Many MeetingsA Final Thought on MeetingsThe Weekly Tactical Meeting Guide	12/1/2005	Wiley India Pvt Ltd	260	English			1	ZZZ000000

9788126507610	WINDOWS SERVER 2003 BIBLE R2 & SPI Ed.	SHAPIRO BOYCE	Paperback	The 2nd Edition of Windows Server 2003 Bible offers new coverage on the addition of Service Pack 1 (SP1) to the Operating System. In the past service packs catering to bug fixes, obscure security fixes, and code updates, were not the driving forces behind new editions of the Server Bible, however, critical changes to the operating system with respect to security, configuration, change and update management have necessitated the publication of a 2nd edition to cater to Service Pack 1. These updates include many significant changes in how Windows Server 2003 is installed, configured, and released to production.In addition, since its release in 2003, security threats to the operating system have increased by an order of magnitude. So bad were the attacks coming at this OS that installing a new server had to be done on a sealed network with a specialized system of patching the server with security updates before the released server could be exposed to the corporate network. Servers were coming under attack and were vulnerable as soon as they were released to production. The service pack provides an entirely new layer of security to the operating system. You can now install an operating system and keep it protected automatically on the open corporate network while it receives new updates from Microsoft to secure it. This and the new Windows Update Service are the key focus of the 2nd edition. The new security features of the operating system make this a critical 2nd edition that will keep this title competitive.Windows Server 2003 ArchitecturePlanning, Installation, and ConfigurationActive Directory ServicesNetworking and Communication ServicesAvailability ManagementFile, Print, Web, and Application Services	8/1/2007	Wiley India Pvt Ltd	1220	English			1	ZZZ000000

9788126508563	SILOS, POLITICS AND TURF WARS	PATRICK LENCIONI	Hardback	Lencioni's fifth "fable" and sixth book to date offers solutions to a key leadership issue: the impact of turf wars and political infighting on organizational effectiveness. "Silos" are an organization's vertical structures, but the word has become synonymous with barriers to workplace effectiveness and connotes deep political conflict. Silos devastate organizations, kill productivity, push good people out the door, and jeopardize the achievement of corporate goals. They cause stress, exasperation and disappointment by forcing employees to fight unwinnable battles with people who should be teammates. Like his other fables, this book is written in the form of a realistic but fictional story. Unlike those books, however, it involves not one but three organizations, all struggling to eliminate their silos and bring a sense of alignment back into place.

9788126509331	ENGINEERING OPTIMIZATION: METHODS AND APPLICATIONS	A. RAVINDRAN& K.M. RAGSDELL& G.V. REKLAITIS	Paperback	In the most general terms, optimization theory is a body of mathematical results and numerical methods for finding and identifying the best candidate from a collection of alternatives without having to explicitly enumerate and evaluate all possible alternatives. The process of optimization lies at the root of engineering, since the classical function of the engineer is to design new, better, more efficient and less expensive systems as well as to devise plans and procedures for the improved operation of existing systems. Most optimization routines are lengthy and therefore are efficiently applied through the use of the computer, but an understanding of the processes is needed to identify needs and interpret results. This book supplies the student and practicing engineer with the tools to understand and use optimization theory.Introduction to OptimizationFunctions of a Single VariableFunctions of Several VariablesLinear ProgrammingConstrained Optimality CriteriaTransformation MethodsConstrained Direct SearchLinearization Methods for Constrained ProblemsDirection Generation Methods Based on LinearizationQuadratic Approximation Methods for Constrained ProblemsStructured Problems and AlgorithmsComparison of Constrained Optimization MethodsStrategies for Optimization StudiesEngineering Case Studies	9/1/2007	Wiley India Pvt Ltd	688	English			1	ZZZ000000

Thus there's no good way for an applicant to prepare for interviews or to interpret the signals she sends prospective employers by the way she conducts herself during the test. Programmers need to meet challenges of the software interview every time they apply for a job; rarely if ever is someone hired on the basis of having done similar work elsewhere. The software demographic changes jobs with frequency, and understands that remuneration offered for a given position depends in part on how well they acquit themselves when confronted with a poser.The Job Application ProcessApproaches to Programming ProblemsLinked ListsTrees and GraphsArrays and StringsRecursionOther Programming TopicsCounting, Measuring, and Ordering PuzzlesGraphical and Spatial PuzzlesKnowledge-Based QuestionsNon-Technical Questions	10/1/2006	Wiley India Pvt Ltd	272	English			1	ZZZ000000

9788126510412	VISUAL STUDIO 2005: ALL-IN-ONE DESK REFERENCE	VANESSA L. WILLIAMS	Paperback	A thorough revision to the Visual Studio 2005 All-In-One Desk Reference For Dummies makes this the ideal book for new programmers or Java programmers looking to get up and running with Visual Studio. The book will be a comprehensive, value-priced reference for the entire Visual Studio 2005.  Microsofts catch-phrase for Visual Studio 2005 is personal productivity. The goal of personal productivity is to allow the developer to work at a higher level of abstraction. The goal of this book is to show the reader how to build applications using these productivity features of VS. As a result, language syntax and programming constructs are de-emphasized in favor of showing the user how to let VS generate the code.This book takes a layered approach similar to how most applications are architected. When developing a new application, developers often divide up the work for the user interface, service layer (data access), and domain classes (coding). Whether there is one developer playing all three roles, or three developers doing each, this approach allows the reader to easily reference the layer they are constructing.	11/1/2006	Wiley India Pvt Ltd	912	English			1	ZZZ000000

9788126511723	EXPERT ONE-ON-ONE: VISUAL BASIC 2005 DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT	ROD STEPHENS	Paperback	Visual Basic 2005, together with the .NET Framework, provides a wonderfully powerful development environment. With these tools developers can build amazingly powerful applications relatively quickly and easily.With this power, however, comes great complexity. Many books are available that discuss the Visual Basic language and if you need to build a relatively simple application those are generally sufficient. No books, however, address the complex issues that surround the development of more complicated Visual Basic applications. None discuss design, modeling, user interface design, or testing for Visual Basic applications.These books also dont cover some of the important advanced topics that dont fit well into introductory books. They generally dont have the time to cover threading, reflection, advanced memory management, and printing in the depth necessary to make them useful for building really advanced applications.Expert One-on-One Visual Basic 2005 Design and Development fills the gaps that these books leave surrounding Visual Basic development. It explains the design activities that are necessary before Visual Basic development can begin. It covers processes that occur after development such as deployment, update management, and testing that are essential to a successful Visual Basic project but that are not part of the language itself. Finally, it covers advanced topics that are useful in real-world applications but that are given little attention in other books.Part I: DesignPart II: Meta-DevelopmentPart III: DevelopmentPart IV: Specific Techniques	2/8/2007	Wiley India Pvt Ltd	648	English			1	ZZZ000000

SCHARDT	Paperback	UML (Unified Modeling Language) is a graphical modeling language used to specify, visualize, construct, and document applications and software systems, which are implemented with components and object-oriented programming languages, such as Java, C++, and Visual Basic. UML incorporates the object-oriented community's consensus on core modeling concepts and provides a standard way for developers to communicate the details of system design and development. In addition to object-oriented modeling of applications, UML is also used for business-process modeling, data modeling, and XML modeling.  Models for software systems are as important as having a blueprint for a large building or an outline for a book. Good models enhance communication among project teams and assure architectural soundness. The more complex the software system, the more important it is to have models that accurately describe the system and can be understood by everyone. UML helps provide this via a standard for graphical diagrams.

9788126518357	GENE FLOW FROM GM PLANTS	GUY M POPPY& MICHAEL J WILKINSON	Hardback	Gene flow is not unique to genetically modified (GM) crops, but the possibility of the spread of transgenic DNA to wild and domesticated relatives raises a new set of issues for scientists and policymakers to consider. Unfortunately, we are still too often unable to quantify the risks of ecological damage associated with gene flow. This is due partly to the huge breadth of knowledge required to assemble a comprehensive risk assessment. For example, many scientists active in research on the mechanics of gene flow nevertheless lack a deep understanding of what is required to identify, characterise and assess ecological risk, and many of those who are aware of the risk assessment process and the framework used for legislation have insufficient knowledge of the reproductive biology, agricultural systems, modelling and ecological literature required to compile a balanced risk assessment.This book, set in the context of gene flow in general, considers the assessment, measurement and management of the risks of gene flow from GM plants, combining the expertise of all the various stakeholders. It is directed at researchers and professionals in plant molecular genetics and plant ecology, in both the academic and industrial sectors.Where Science fits into the GM debate Crop biotechnology - the state of play Pollen dispersal vector5ed by wind or insects Hybridisation - reproductive barriers to gene flow Rare hybrids and methods for their detection Assessing the ecological fitness of recipients Assessing the environmental risks of gene flow from GM crops to wild relatives Quantifying exposure Regulating the risks of gene flowRisk assessment of GM crops - does the road ahead need to be long and winding 	9/1/2008	Wiley India Pvt Ltd	256	English			1	ZZZ000000

9788126517893	LITERARY THEORY: AN INTRODUCTION, ANNIVERSARY ED	TERRY EAGLETON	Paperback	First published in 1983, Literary Theory: An Introduction is probably the best-selling work of literary criticism in the world today. It propelled its author to a position of such influence and controversy within the British academy that even Prince Charles once described him as that dreadful Terry Eagleton.A quarter of a century on from its original publication, Literary Theory: An Introduction still conjures the subversion, excitement and exoticism that characterized theory through the 1960s and 70s, when it posed an unprecedented challenge to the literary establishment. Contemporary readers seeking to understand what literature is and what it is for will be inspired and entertained by Eagletons deft synopses of the major movements in literary studies in the twentieth century. Eagleton has added a new preface to this anniversary edition to address more recent developments in literary studies, including what he describes as the growth of a kind of anti-theory, and the idea that literary theory has been institutionalized. Insightful and enlightening, Literary Theory: An Introduction remains the essential guide to the field.1. The Rise of English2. Phenomenology, Hermeneutics, Reception Theory3.

9788126518623	REMINISCENCES OF A STOCK OPERATOR	EDWIN LEFEVRE	Paperback	Reminiscences of a Stock Operator is adapted from a series of Saturday Evening Post articles written by Edwin Lefevre in the 1920s.  The book narrates Livermores ascent from a boy plunger to the most influential speculator on Wall Street.  While much of the book is devoted to Livermores experiences, a larger part of the book deals with trading wisdom and rules that Livermore imparts through Lefevre.  Years later, many trading and investing books repeat the very same rules first enunciated by Livermore in Reminiscences, such as: go with the trend; no stock is too high to buy or too low to sell; let your winners run and cut your losses short; make your own decisions; and market history repeats itself.  Interestingly, Livermore frequently violated his own rules and usually lost money as a result.  The enduring appeal to the book rests in Livermores view that the market is made up of people and the excesses of the market reflect mass psychology and the mistakes of individuals are frequently the result of the inability to control fear and greed.  Thus, the views and lessons of Livermore continue to be relevant to every new generation of investors and traders.	9/1/2008	Wiley India Pvt Ltd	288	English			1	ZZZ000000

Regulatory legislation is very tight in this area as the different 'handiness' of a compound can have a great effect on its function. There were a number of books on this subject published in the late eighties but most of these are now out of date if not out of print. This subject is still extremely important in the pharmaceutical industry and there is a demand for newer more up to date books which appears not to have been met by the number of books which have published in recent years. This book will add to these and will complement other titles in the Separation Science Series.An Introduction to Chiral ChromatographyMechanism of Solute RetentionMolecular InteractionsThe Basic Gas ChromatographGC Chiral Stationary Phases and ColumnsChiral Gas Chromatography ApplicationsThe Basic Liquid ChromatographLiquid Chromatography Chiral Stationary PhasesPreparation of LC Chiral Phases and ColumnsColumn Temperature and Mobile Phase Composition: Their Effect on Column Length and Analysis TimeChiral Liquid Chromatography ApplicationsPreparative Chiral ChromatographyChiral Separations by Capillary Electrophoresis and Capillary ElectrochomatographyAn Experimental Approach to Chiral Chromatography	11/1/2008	Wiley India Pvt Ltd	524	English			1	ZZZ000000

More and more CEOs are failing, but the dearth of CEOs capable of placing their companies on a sustainable footing is as much a symptom as a cause of the malaise affecting corporate management. The true crisis in leadership is the stagnant state of corporate leadership development. Because companies dont properly hone their unit managers leadership abilities, they never fill their succession pipelines. And because unit managers are stagnating, companies have difficulty executing at every level, compounding the crisis.

Along the way she shares inspiring stories, practical strategies and interactive assessment tools to illustrate how the best workplace practices can bring more joy and success to family life. Drawing from two decades of experience, she lays out her "best practices" to improve your communication, create a healthy family culture, discover your parent leadership style, manage crises, thrive during adolescence, and juggle work and family priorities. Readers will explore common leadership dilemmas, including: When to step in and when to step back How to maximize the learning opportunities that come from mistakes How to stay connected with a pesky toddler or testy teenager How to create rituals that strengthen the family's esprit de corps When to push kids and when to let them quit How to feel less like a maid or short-order cook and more like a skilled leader capable of unleashing the potential of others. Mom-in-Chief addresses real quandaries and covers everything that smart career-oriented women need to know in order to fulfill their parenting potential and navigate challenges with skill and grace. This book is a welcome reminder that leading a family doesn't mean churning out living masterpieces, or indulging children with the perfect everything. It does mean inspiring without pushing your own agenda, nurturing without micromanaging, encouraging without aiming to win a best-of-show competition, and expecting the best without ignoring the joyful ordinariness of childhood.

PARKER	Paperback	Who Said So? introduces a unique leadership philosophy: Value-Centered Management. The book's content is introduced through a business narrative that outlines the familiar pains of traditional business management compared with a Value-Centered approach. John is an MBA graduate who is pouring all of his energy into his role in a large I.T. firm. Now, he is facing the toughest assignment of his life--leading the effort to retain an important, yet dissatisfied client. Filled with doubts about the effectiveness of traditional management, John returns home for the weekend where his father begins to share Value-Centered Management principles. John's father, Tim, has extensive traditional business experience, having risen through the ranks of corporate America only to find it frustrating and unfulfilling. After learning about Value-Centered Management, he has adopted a customer-centric approach to managing and expanding his business opportunities with some amazing results. John is cynical of his father's rather eccentric advice, but he's desperate. And so begins the journey of a prodigal son who discovers that to build a thriving business he must: 1) determine what customers truly value; 2) build a customer-driven culture that focuses on those key values; and 3) implement lean principles.Forerword.

9788126520961	LEADERSHIP: LESSONS FROM THE ANCIENT WORLD	ARTHUR COTTERELL& ROGER LOWE& IAN SHAW	Paperback	The study of ancient events from a business perspective offers a unique way of observing how leadership actually works. The leaders presented and discussed in this book are significant figures in their own right. Many of the things they did were extremely successful, and the consequences of their failures were just as spectacular. These leaders decided on courses of action within the context of their times, aware of the range of possibilities that were open to them. This allows us to note how they responded in different contexts and how temperament, intelligence, experience and advice came into play as they dealt with pressing problems. The actual methods they used to implement their decisions are also instructive, since they illustrate a choice of approaches still faced by managers as leaders today. The authors show how these lessons are being used in today's organisations and how readers can implement them in their everyday managerial roles. Each of the fourteen chapters addresses a key theme in leadership and each is structured in the same way:         Historical setting of the leader and outline of the action taken         Recent thinking on the leadership topic under review, with reference to the decisions taken by that leader         A contemporary challenge, with cases drawn from organizational settings in both public and private sectorsTable of contentsPreface.Introduction.1.

What this really combines is (1) knowledge of the client's business (traditionally handled by the client itself and the Account Executive), (2) the ad agency's creative skills (traditionally handled by the agency Creative Department -- the Copywriter and the Art Director), and (3) research into what the consumer wants--at every stage of the development of an advertising campaign (traditionally handled by the agency's Research Department). Account Planning seeks to integrate these disciplines in order to produce better, more effective ads that will ultimately appeal more to the consumer and sell more of the client's product.No Room for the Mouse: The Failure to Involve Consumers in Advertising Communication.Table of contentsSilent Partners: Account Planning and the New Consumer Alliance.The Blind Leading the Bland: Advertising Follows Research...in the Wrong Direction.Peeling the Onion: Uncovering the Truth and Stimulating Creative Ideas through Research.The Fisherman's Guide: The Importance of Creative Briefing.Ten Housewives in Des Moines: The Perils of Researching Rough Creative Ideas.Serendipity: "Got Milk?"

It starts from how customers see the world, what they seek to achieve and the context in which they see your business as part of that activity or ambition. It reaches deeper into the customer psyche, reaching beyond superficial research averages, beyond articulating needs and wants based on convention, to what motivates and inspires them. And as a result, learns to work on their terms -- inverting the way we do business, pull rather than push, understanding where, when and how they want to do work with us. It recognizes that customers expect companies to do more for people -- to go beyond the product, the transaction, to add more value to their lives, helping them to achieve what they couldn't otherwise.PART 1 The Customer World.PART 2 The Customer Business.PART 3 The Customer Champions.	9/1/2009	Wiley India Pvt Ltd	408	English			1	ZZZ000000
