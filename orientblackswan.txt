9788125039211	The art of not being governed,an anarchist history of upland Southeast Asia	James C Scott		For two thousand years the disparate groups that now reside in Zomia (a mountainous region the size of Europe that consists of portions of seven Asian countries) have field the projects of the organised state societies that surround them slavery, conscription, taxes, corvee labour, epidemics and warfare. Significantly, writes James C.Scott in this iconoclastic study, these people are not innocent who have yet to benefit from all that civilization has to offer; they have assessed state-based civilizations and have made a conscious choice to avoid them. The book is essentially an anarchist history , the first-ever examination of the huge literature on state-making that evaluates why people would deliberately and reactively remain stateless. Among the strategies employed by the people of Zomia to remain stateless are physical dispersion in rugged terrain; agriculture practices that enhance mobiliy; pliable ethnic identities; devotion to prophetic, millenarian leaders; and maintenance of a largely oral culture that allows them to reinvent their histories and genealogies as they move between and around states.	2010	Orient BlackSwan						ZZZ000000

9788187358299	Delhi,Ancient History	Upinder Singh		Not Many People Know That The Busy And Bustling Capital City Of Delhi And Its Surroundings Have A Long Past, Going Back Thousands Of Years. Prehistoric Stone Tools Have Surfaced Here And Many Ancient Remains Have Been Found, Sometimes Accidentally By Farmers Tilling Their Fields, And At Other Times By Archaeologists Carrying Out Systematic Excavations. A Mound One Passes Everyday Or A Narrow Strip Of Stream Tells A Story Of Ancient Times. Centuries Of History Coexist With Metro Stations And Plush Cars. The Readings In This Book Give Us Glimpses Of The Lives Of People Who Lived In The Delhi Area Over The Centuries, And How These Details Have Been Pieced Together By Historians. It Brings Into Focus The Importance Of The Historian S Method And The Sources Of Information Found In Ancient Texts, Archaeology And Even Legends And Folklore, Sometimes Hanging On The Thread Of A Slender Historical Fact. The Editor Of The Volume, Points To The Urgency Of Further Exploration And Documentation To Fill In The Still All-Too-Meagre Details Of Delhi S Ancient History. However, She Ends On A Note Of Caution, Bordering On Alarm, When She Points Out That Invaluable Evidence Of The City S Past Is Being Extensively Destroyed Due To Quarrying And The Construction Of New Roads And Buildings. Such Activities Are An Integral Part Of The Modernization Of A Living City But The Balance Between Modernization And The Preservation Of Ancient Remains Is Indeed Very Fragile And Needs To Be Maintained From An Informed And Realistic Perspective. This Collection Of Essays Has Been Put Together By A Teacher For Students Of History, But Will Also Be Of Enormous Value To A Large Number Of Other Interested Readers.	2007-08-01	Berghahn Books						ZZZ000000

Fourteen interesting papers, based on intensive fieldwork in Nepal, Sri Lanka, Pakistan and India, explore a highly controversial subject. They touch on the everyday religious lives of the Muslims in these countries. The book argues that Islam cannot be understood through the works of theologians alone, for whom it is a formal, uniform and rigid system of beliefs and practices. Popular Islam, or Islam as it is practised by millions of Muslims in South Asia, has an empirical validity and is a dynamic process of adjustment and accommodation as well as conflict with other religions, with which it coexists.	2004	Berghahn Books						ZZZ000000

The undergraduate student is at a critical crossroads today: he needs to learn his subject as well as learn how to communicate his knowledge and ideas with others. While the specialized subject area is well within his reach with some effort and aptitude, communicative skills need to be learnt through the right kind of material. The right kind of material is not so easily available. This textbook has been prepared with this particular need in mind and therefore the right kinds of guidelines are provided for the student to achieve the skills required in order to communicate effectively in everyday situations and for everyday needs.

It Is Argued That The Successful Spread Of Hindu Nationalism In This Area Is Due To The Involvement Of The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (Rss), A Militant Hindu Nationalist Organization, In Local Affairs. While Active Engagement In 'Civilizing' Strategies Has Enabled The Rss To Legitimize Its Presence And Endear Itself To The Local Community, The Book Argues That Participation In More Aggressive Strategies Has Made It Possible For This Organization To Fuel And Attach Local Tensions To A Broader Hindu Nationalist Agenda.

9788125036807	Scripting lives,narratives of 'dominant women' in Kerala	Sharmila Sreekumar		How does one examine the lives women script in the intimacy of diaries, letters and other personal narratives and how can one relate these to the social worlds in which they are produced? Centring its investigation on contemporary Kerala, it examines a range of diverse and seemingly disconnected discourses around the Kerala model, tourism, AIDS and sexual violence and argues that present-day Kerala maps two opposing worlds. It imagines itself as a perfected utopia and, simultaneously, also as a dystopiaa society that is on the edge of collapse. The book attempts to explore these divergent self-descriptions of Kerala. Concurrently it also analyses a range of personal narratives to trace how dominant women configure their selves. It deploys the term dominant women to signal women of relative privilege, whose experience speaks simultaneously of devaluation and dominance. Their lives also signal the asymmetries, the instabilities and the inequalities within the category woman . These women are, in many ways, the subject of the development narratives of the state. The book reveals how discourses apparently removed from women s everyday shape their personal experiences and, in turn, how women s self-formations overwrite, extend and rework these larger discourses. Sreekumar s writing is compelling and textured. Her research, based on a wide range of women s narratives, makes this a riveting journey into the makings of modern-day Kerala.	2009	Orient BlackSwan						ZZZ000000

As the contributors to this volume demonstrate, what we have come to regard as acts of terror whether politically motivated or state sanctioned have assumed many different forms and provoked widely differing responses throughout the world. At a deeper level, the contributors explore the work of the imagination in extreme contexts of danger, such as those of terror and terrorism. By stressing the imagination, and its role in amplifying the effects of experience, this collection brings together a coherent set of analyses that offer innovative and unexpected ways of understanding a major global problem of contemporary life.	2007	Orient Longman						ZZZ000000
9788187358350	The Sundarbans,Folk Dieties, Monsters and Mortals	Sutapa Chatterjee Sarkar		The lower deltaic Bengal, the Sundarbans has always had a life of its own, unique in its distinctive natural aspect and social development. Geographical and ecological evidence indicates that most of the area used to be once covered with dense, impenetrable jungle even as patches of cultivation sprang intermittently into life and then disappeared. A continuous struggle ensued between man and nature, as portrayed in the punthi literature that thrived in lower deltaic Bengal between the seventeenth and nineteenth centuries. The construction of a permanent railroad connecting Calcutta to Canning further facilitated the influx of new ideas and these, subsequently, found expression in the spreading of co-operative movements, formation of peasant organizations, and finally culminated in open rebellion by the peasants (Tebhaga Movement). The struggle between men and the dangerous forests was therefore overshadowed by the conflict among men. This book will be of great interest to students of history, sociology, anthropology and economic geography.	2010	Berghahn Books						ZZZ000000

This period, as Dickens himself says, was the darkest in his life and the shame and resentment he felt, made his sufferings a secret he could not share with anyone. Thus, from a first-hand knowledge acquired under unhappy circumstances, Dickens gives his readers a glimpse of the unsavoury side of Victorian England-struggling poverty and debtor s prisons. There are many characters in the novel whom Dickens knew and many places in London that David visits were frequented by Dickens himself.

During a long and creative career, he excelled in the different art forms that he practised-poetry, drama, music, novels and short stories. In 1901, he founded Shantiniketan (Adobe of Peace), in Bolpur near Kolkata, an educational institution where education was to be imparted in an unrestricted manner. He was the first Indian to win the Nobel Prize in 1913, for his poetic work Gitanjali (An Offering of Songs) which he himself had translated into English from his various volumes of poetry. He was knighted in 1915, but returned Bagh massacre of 1919. He died in 1941, heartbroken by a number of personal tragedies and disillusioned by the outbreak of the Second World War in Europe. Through primarily remembered as a poet, Tagore s short stories have earned a pride in modern Bangla literature. The stories in this collection are respresentative of Tagore s writings. We find the empathy of a father for a stranger in The Kabuliwala, the sorrow of parting in The Postmaster, the comic in When Wishes Come True and the social divide that riches cause in The Return Gift.	2004-01-10	Orient Blackswan						ZZZ000000

9788125036579	Fiction as window,critiquing the Indian literary cultural ethos since the 1980s	V Padma&Mangai		Fiction in India has witnessed great changes since the 1980s. Written, critiqued, read, patronised and translated from the myriad subject positions that Indian culture is teeming with, fiction is a valuable site from which to critique the Indian literary cultural ethos. Fiction as Window, in its first part, uses the fiction produced across languages in India during this vibrant period to critically look at the issues that criticism, patronage and translation of fiction throws up. Cutting across languages, in its second part, the book analyses novels from various Indian languages and those written or translated into English in an attempt to see how these issues are fictionalised. The book cuts new ground with its blend of the literary and the aliterary and its analyses of awards foundations as sites of production of a cultural tradition. The field of literary studies in India since the 1980s has seen a decisive shift towards greater interdisciplinarity. Neither is literature any longer merely a connoisseur s delight nor is literary criticism any more barely an exercise in aesthetic interpretation. Subversive conceptual changes have made it impossible for literature to remain an isolated creative activity. Literary criticism has perforce to encompass these changes and study their relation to the prevailing forms, themes and techniques in literature today using an integrated methodology. Even as creative literature is fast becoming a discursive space where pressing issues and concerns can be debated and discussed, literary criticism is compelled to turn ideological and is showing an increasing awareness, in a self-reflexive manner, of the paradigms and assumptions that inform its own activity. This study aims at examining the literary cultural ethos in India during this stimulating and perhaps even turbulent period.	2009	Orient BlackSwan						ZZZ000000
9788125036937	The G N Devy reader	G. N. Devy		A dominated culture learns not just to be like the culture that dominates it, but also attempts to conceal its own antecedents. In such cultural encounters, amnesia plays a major role in defining the self-perception of cultures. G. N. Devy s After Amnesia, first published in 1992, offers an incisive analysis of contemporary literary scholarship in Indian languages by demonstrating how modern Indian languages learnt to forget that literary criticism had been rejected by them during the post-Sanskrit medieval centuries, and how they have posed before themselves a false choice of intellectual practices rooted in culturally distant Western or Sanskritic traditions. After Amnesia proposes that what has come to be seen as a crisis in Indian literary criticism can be understood if a relevant historiography is formulated. Of Many Heroes , first published in 1997, is an attempt to formulate such a historiography. If After Amnesia is an essay on literary criticism, Of Many Heroes is a historiography of literary historiography in India. It presents a wide spectrum of survey of texts on literary history, beginning with the fourth century Bhartrihari s Vakyapadiya to the seminal texts produced during the twentieth century. The Reader brings together two other new essays by G. N. Devy The Being of Bhasha and Countering Violence. These philosophical essays discuss the significance of dialects and vanishing languages in the making of civilization, the place of silence and insanity in the making of meaning, and of language itself in the future of knowledge. After closely analyzing the sociological and psychological roots of violence, the author argues that the increasing violence in modern societies and the loss of languages in an increasingly intolerant and aggressive world need to be seen as closely related aspects of the cultural impact of historical processes germinating in colonialism and globalization hostile to cultural plurality. The four essays together present a complete theory of knowledge in postcolonial times. They present a plea for a radical reorientation to the question of education, knowledge, expression and interpretation of linguistic creative. They are, perhaps, the most challenging and unorthodox thesis on epistemic and hermeneutical issues central to modern Indian culture	2009	Orient Blackswan						ZZZ000000

It brings the archival material to centre stage and employs theatrical tools from the fields of gender, translation and culture studies. The book shows the intersections between colonial subjugations and postcolonial longings.	2008	Orient Longman						ZZZ000000
9788125034636	Language,Ideology And Power	Tariq Rahman		This is the first book-length study of the history of language teaching and learning among South Asian Muslims. It traces the history of language-teaching among the Muslims of north India and present-day Pakistan, and then relates language-learning (the demand) and teaching (the supply) to ideology (or world view) and power. It makes the point that the Muslims in this part of the world, like other people elsewhere, learned languages to empower themselves by acquiring marketable linguistic skills at all periods of history. It also argues that those who determine what languages, and what textbooks, are to be taught, would like to, and are in a position to promote the ideology which, in their opinion, promotes or consolidates their own power, or maintains the status quo. In short, the teaching and learning of languages is linked to the distribution of power which, in turn, is connected to employment, promotion of certain ideologies, shaping of identities, and national interest.	2008	Orient BlackSwan						ZZZ000000
9788125033592	Mobilising India (Pul)	Tejaswini Nilan		The book argues for the importance of comparative research across the global South. Key terms of contemporary critical analyses colonialism, nation, modernity, citizenship, identity, and subjectivity are often explicated in the bounded context of nation-states in the South, or with reference to Western European societies. Indeed, an important feature of twentieth century scholarship could well be the nation-centrism of the analyses of intellectual formations of the period. The project proceeds on the assumption that South-South comparative work problematizes the standard use of these terms, and adds new dimensions to their usage even in specific national contexts. The attempt is to change the frame of reference so that the West does not become the sole norm against which we measure each other. The central focus of the book is the woman question as it emerges through the mobilization of Indianness and other related notions of region, ethnic group or race. The intertwining of gender issues with the formation and assertion of different kinds of identities in Trinidad and India is explored. The analysis has a historical component and a more contemporary one, the latter being routed through popular music in Trinidad.	2008	Orient BlackSwan						ZZZ000000
9788125035114	New Cultural Studies (Pul)	Clare Birchall Gary Hall		New Cultural Studies is both an introductory reference work and an original study which explores new directions and territories for cultural studies. A new generation has begun to emerge from the shadow of the Birmingham School. It is a generation whose whole university education has been shaped by theory, and who frequently turn to it as a means to think through some of the issues and current problems in contemporary culture and culture studies. In a period where departments which were once hotbeds of 'high theory' are returning to more sociological and social science oriented modes of research, and 9/11 and the war on Iraq especially have helped create a sense of 'post-theoretical' political urgency which leaves little time for the 'elitist', 'Eurocentric', 'textual' concerns of 'Theory', theoretical approaches to the study of culture have for many of this generation never seemed so important nor so vital. New Cultural Studies explores theory's past, present and most especially its future role in cultural studies. It does so by providing an authoritative and accessible guide, for students and researchers alike, to:	2009	Orient BlackSwan						ZZZ000000

Nineteenthcentury Madras Led The Way In The Transformation That Karnatik Music Underwent As It Encountered The Forces Of Modernization And Standardization. This Study Also Contributes To Our Understanding Of The Experience Of Modernity In India Through The Prism Of Music. The Role Of Madras City As Patron And Custodian Of The Performing Arts, Especially Classical Music Offers An Invaluable Perspective On The Larger Processes Of Modernization In India As The Title Suggests, The Areas Of Classical Music, Which Were Most Influenced By These Developments Were Pedagogy Or Modes Of Musical Transmission, Performance Conventions And Criticism Or Music Appreciation. Once The Urban Elite Demanded The Widening Of The Teaching Of Classical Music, Traditional Modes Of Music Instruction Underwent A Major Change Involving A Breakdown Of The Gurushishya Parampara Or The Tradition Wherein The Teacher Imparted Knowledge To A Chosen Few. Caste And Kinship Were Important Determining Factors For The Selection Of These Shishyas Or Students, But In Modern Institutions Like The Universities These Boundaries Had To Be Demolished. Simultaneously, The Public Staging Of Music Brought The Performer Into A New Relationship With His Audience, Especially As The Art Form Became Subject To Validation And Criticism By The Newly Emerging Music Critic.In An Immensely Readable Book Peppered With Anecdotes And Conversations With Leading Musicians And Critics Of The Day, As Well As Humorous Visual Representations, Part Caricature, Part Satirical, The Author Describes A Rapidly Changing Society And Its New Look In Early Twentieth Century Madras.	2008-07-01	Berghahn Books						ZZZ000000

9788125037903	First Promise, The (Revised Edition)	Ashapurna Debi&Indira Chowdhury		The First Promise is a translation of Ashapurna Debi s novel, Pratham Pratisruti , originally published in Bengali in 1964. Celebrated as one of the most popular and path-breaking novels of its time, it has received continual critical acclaim: the Rabindra Puraskar (the Tagore Prize) in 1966 and the Bharitiya Jnanpith, India s highest literary award, in 1977. Spanning the late eighteenth and early twentieth centuries, Ashapurna tells the story of the struggles and efforts of women in nineteenth-century, colonial Bengal in a deceptively easy and conversational style. The charming eight-year old heroine, Satyabati is a child bride who leaves her husband s village for Calcutta, the capital of British India where she is caught in the social dynamics of women s education, social reform agendas, modern medicine and urban entertainment. As she makes her way through this complex maze, making sense of the rapidly changing world around her, Satyabati nurtures hopes and aspirations for her daughter. But the promises held out by modernity turn out to be empty, instigating Satyabati to break away from her inherited world and initiate a quest that takes her to the very heart of tradition.	2009	Orient BlackSwan						ZZZ000000

9788125037057	The scar	K A Gunasekaran		Growing up as a boy from the Parayar caste, in the milieu of Christian, Hindu and Muslim communities, K.A. Gunasekaran narrates the familiar tale of caste oppression and prejudice prevalent in the villages of Tamil Nadu. As the narrative unfolds, the reader is shown how the low caste negotiates differently with the three religious communities. The deep pain of the Paraya surfaces through the risible anecdotes that ridicule the grievously unjust practices of the upper castes. The book emphasises the fact that Indian villages are doubly caste-conscious and cruel, and that Dalit emancipation rests in better education for the community. Gunasekaran writes in an earthy and colloquial style to capture the innocence, cruelty and drama of a South Indian village. Considered the first modern Dalit autobiography in Tamil, The Scar is an important book calling for Dalit assertion and emancipation.	2009	Orient BlackSwan						ZZZ000000
9788125036012	This gift of English,English education and the formation of alternative hegemonies in India	Alok K Mukherjee		This provocative work deconstructs the popular belief that English was imposed on India by the British. Mukherjee draws on the theories of Gramsci and Bourdieu to demonstrate that the rise of English and the continued valorization of the literatures of Anglo-America in post-independence India have their roots in a conjuncture of the hegemonic agendas of British colonial rulers and high caste Hindus. Through English education, British colonial intellectuals hoped to civilize a benighted people and to perpetuate colonial rule. High caste Hindus, on the other hand, saw in English education the possibility of Hindu revival. Embracing the theory of a common racial origin, they argued that English education would help revive India s lost glorious past by giving access to the scientific and rational traditions of the Hindus racial kin, the Europeans. After India s independence, English education, as a field and an institutional practice, continued to be brahmanical . With Dalits demanding English, it is now the site of a new contest of alternative hegemonies.

9788187358107	Reforming India's social sector,poverty, nutrition, health and gender	K. Seeta Prabhu&R. Sudarshan		It is widely believed that economic reforms widen inequalities in societies which are already highly unequal and the impact of economic reforms on social sectors, particularly in developing economies like India, has therefore been a subject of great concern. These economies, it is argued, face the double problem of poverty, deprivation and inequality on the one hand and cutbacks in fiscal expenditures (to prune budgetary expenditures) on the other. This book addresses this problem, drawing out the debates in each of the themes of poverty alleviation, nutrition, health and education with the use of theoretical and empirical analysis.	2002	Berghahn Books						ZZZ000000

Just as trade, finance, information and technologies are moving rapidly across borders, so too have labour markets and transnational migrant communities. Migrants are sending large quantities of money back to their countries of origin in the form of philanthropy, remittances and commercial investments. They are also sharing knowledge and skills learned or honed abroad. Is greater global equity an inevitable consequence of diaspora engagement in their countries of origin, or can it actually aggravate inequity? Diasporas and Development examines the positive and sometimes negative impacts of diaspora engagement through examination of policies and philanthropic modalities as well as specific regional examples of diaspora activity.	2009	Orient BlackSwan						ZZZ000000

Gandhi saw khadi as heralding real freedom to the millions of poor and marginalised Indians. Recreating a parallel history of the khadi movement alongside that of India's freedom struggle, the author argues that khadi's core semiotic lay in its being a commodity of resistance against colonial exploitation.	2008	Orient Longman						ZZZ000000

9788125036999	Global Economic And Financial Crisis: Essays From Economic And Political Weekly	Sameeksha Trust (Bombay&India)		A collapse in housing prices in the United States in the middle of 2007 led to a rise in defaults in loan repayments and then rapidly to major losses in financial institutions across the world. The financial crisis of 2007 and 2008 took little time to turn into the global economic crisis of 2008 and 2009, leaving no country and no sector untouched and has become the worst contraction since the Depression of the 1930s. The structure of financial innovation that drove growth for close to a quarter of a century has turned out to be a house of cards. Governments and central banks are now rethinking the organization and role of banks. The incentives given to executives of the financial institutions to promote profits at all costs have been put under scrutiny. This volume puts together a collection of essays on a number of aspects of the global economic and financial crisis that were first published in the Economic & Political Weekly in early 2009. Economists and policy makers from across the world cover six areas from a global and Indian perspective. One set of articles discusses the structural causes of the financial crisis. A second focuses on banking and offers solutions for the future. A third examines the role of the US dollar in the unfolding of the crisis. A fourth area of study is the impact on global income distribution. A fifth set of essays takes a long-term view of policy choices confronting the governments of the world. A separate section assesses the downturn in India, the state of the domestic financial sector, the impact on the informal economy and the reforms necessary to prevent another crisis. This book is essential reading for anyone interested in and concerned about the global economic and financial crisis.	2009	Orient Longman						ZZZ000000

9788125026204	Political Economy In Macroeconomics	Allan Drazen		Political Economy in Macroeconomics is the first full-length work on the issues of new political economy. This is a multi-disciplinary subject to which increasing numbers of economists are dedicating their time. It analyses the influence of political forces on economic policy by using the analytical tools of economics. However, while emphasising the use of economic models, Drazen has also included related issues such as politics and political philosophy in this volume, and therefore the book contains much conceptual discussion as well as empirical data. At the moment there is no text that covers political economy in macroeconomics at the postgraduate and advanced undergraduate level. This book will fill that gap. It is a survey, textbook, and critique all in one (Dani Rodrik, Harvard University), and has established the benchmark for years to come, in terms of coverage and depth of critical assessment (Leonardo Bartolini, Journal of International Economics).	2004	Orient Blackswan						BUS039000

9788125034612	Linguistic genocide in education, or, Worldwide diversity and human rights ?	Tove Skutnabb-Kangas		In this powerful multidisciplinary new book, Tove Skutnabb-Kangas shows how most indigenous and minority education contributes to linguistic genocide according to United Nations definitions. Her starting point is that it is normal and desirable for people, groups, countries, and schools to be multilingual and multicultural. She brings together theoretical concerns and research areas which no other contemporary book synthesizes: linguistic human rights; minority and multilingual education; language ecology and threatened languages; the relationship between biodiversity and linguistic and cultural diversity; the impact of linguistic imperialism and unequal power relations on ethnicity, linguistic, and cultural competence, and identities. Theory is combined with a wealth of factual encyclopedic information and with many examples and vignettes. The examples come from all parts of the world and try to avoid Eurocentrism. Oriented toward theory and practice, facts and evaluations, reflection and action, the book prompts readers to find information about the world and their local contexts, to reflect, and to act. It is essential reading for scholars, students, and practitioners in the fields of language and society, language policy and language planning, the sociology of education, critical pedagogy, comparative education, educational linguistics, minority studies, cultural studies, human rights, ethnolinguistics, anthropology, and ecological issues. Reviews: This work, by one of the leading scholars of linguistic human rights, presents a provocative, engaging, grand synthesis. It makes a major contribution by bringing together a number of contemporary theoretical and research orientations as evidenced by its focus on linguistic human rights, linguistic ecology, and the impact of linguistic imperialism. In addition, it provides basic insights on anti-racist education.... This is a book that deserves reading by students and scholars committed to furthering educational equity and human rights. Both specialists and those new to the field will find it challenging and informative. It is the type of book that forces educators and students to reflect on their own assumptions and values. -- Terrence Wiley, California State University-Long Beach A pathbreaking text, written with absolute clarity of purpose and commitment.... The book as a whole takes the debates about minority languages much further than ever before.... It is a fascinating and immediate social history of languages, political forces, struggles, and education.... .[Although] this is a lengthy work, and one which may appear to be daunting at the outset.... what one discovers is an engaging and varied style which teases the reader further and further into a domain which has never before been captured from so many and new angles.... It is a privilege and a pleasure to read a work of such international significance. -- Kathleen Heugh, Project for the Study of Alternative Education in South Africa, University of Cape Town An absolutely stirring 'J'accuse', appealing to the conscience of the Western world to cease the ethnolinguistic genocide which it has inflicted on humanity at large. Via a superb and compelling assembly of data, logic, argument, and analysis, Skutnabb-Kangas shows how justice, decency, health, social stability, and normal biodiversity all suffer, even in the West itself, when linguacidal state and global policies are implemented. Nothing less than an international campaign for linguistic human rights is called for and called for with compelling force and convincing clarity. -- Joshua Fishman, University Research Professor of Social Sciences, Yeshiva University, and Visiting Professor of Linguistics, Stanford University A substantial, important, and creative contribution.... Skutnabb-Kangas is a very gifted and respected scholar, and her past work has been seminal in the field. This book not only brings together a number of the themes and topics on which she has worked in the past, but moves forward in a substantial manner the debate about language policy in education broadly conceived.... It represents Skutnabb-Kangas at her very best, and will challenge other researchers, teachers, and policy makers to more honestly and thoughtfully address language-related issues in education. -- Timothy Reagan, University of Connecticut	2008	Orient BlackSwan						ZZZ000000

9788125038429	Promoting Learner Autonomy: A Teacher S Reflections On Esl In India	Prema Kumar Dheram		This book explores the issue of learner autonomy (LA) and its natural progression to teacher autonomy and development. The experiments in teaching and learning, conducted over twenty years and documented here, trace a teacher s progress as a facilitator through her investigations into pedagogy. Each of the ten papers in this collection examines the implications of encouraging independent learning in the ESL classroom what kind of teacher support is helpful and when it should be given. What aspects of language use and language learning do we emphasise in the classroom so that the student identifies the sources of learning in the world outside and learns from them? How do we capitalize on the student s awareness of L1 use to facilitate L2 learning? Does classroom management have any bearing on LA? These papers examine several such LA-related issues and offer guidance on planning lessons, developing material, facilitating interaction, and reflecting on teaching. They should be of interest to the reader also for another reason. The articles illustrate the nature of research that reputed journals encourage. And the choices the writer has with regard to presentation. The book makes quite a few samples available. It inspires and supports teachers, teacher-educators, and researchers to study context-specific practices, and publish their own accounts of promoting learner autonomy.	2010	Orient BlackSwan						ZZZ000000

It is an attempt to describe what is recognised by common agreement to be a crisis in Indian criticism, and to explain it in historical terms. Dr Devy argues that the colonial experience in India gave rise to false images of the West as a superior culture; and induced a state of cultural amnesia and mistaken modes of literary criticism. It is this amnesia that is responsible for the belief among literary historians that the critical tradition in the modern Indian languages for instance, Gujarati and Marathi is only over a hundred years old. The author argues that it is inconceivable for these languages to have produced great literatures for half a millennium without developing some form of literary criticism. Therefore, he says, it is necessary to postulate a more reliable literary history.	1995	Orient Longman						ZZZ000000

9788125032496	Pride And Prejudice	Manju Sambhunat		Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen is one of the immortal favourites in fiction. Lauded time and again by critics and writers alike, the novel is one of the best of Jane Austen's work. 'A miniature painted on two inches of ivory' as Charlotte Bronte called it, the work represents the limited world of the eighteenth-century English countryside with the rural gentry as the central focus. The world as depicted here is a small one, but typical: it is peopled by ordinary men and women totally absorbed with news of the neighbourhood, exchanging visits, attending balls and dances, getting their daughters married to the most eligible bachelors and wearing the best clothes possible on occasions. It is a simple and peaceful attitude to life, and Jane Austen captures it all, in the best language possible. Difficult to forget, the book captivates us by the sharpness of wit and dialogue. This edition is an abridged version of the original classic, and it is hoped that when students read this, they would be drawn to the original and not only this one, but also the rest of Jane Austen's fiction.	2007	Orient BlackSwan						ZZZ000000

9788125031611	Writers In Retrospect (Pul)	Claudia Stokes		In the aftermath of America s centennial celebrations of 1876, readers developed an appetite for chronicles of the nation s past. Born amid this national vogue, the field of American literary history was touted as the balm for numerous ills --from burgeoning immigration to American anti-intellectualism to demanding university administrators and enjoyed immense popularity between 1880 and 1910. In the first major analysis of the field's early decades, Claudia Stokes offers important insights into the practices, beliefs, and values that shaped the emerging discipline and have continued to shape it for the last century. She considers particular personalities including Thomas Wentworth Higginson, William Dean Howells, Brander Matthews, and Mark Twain and episodes that had a formative effect on American literary history as a discipline. Reexamining the field's deep attachment to the literature of antebellum New England, the periodization of the nineteenth century, and the omission of Native narratives, Stokes reveals the many forces, both inside and outside the academy, that propelled the rise of American literary history and persist as influences on the work of current practitioners of the field.	2007	Orient BlackSwan						ZZZ000000

9788125022770	Nature'S Government: Science, Imperial Britain And The 'Improvement' Of The World	Richard Drayton		Nature's Government is a daring attempt to juxtapose the histories of Britain, western science and imperialism. It shows how colonial expansion led to complex kinds of knowledge and in particular the way in which science and botany was fed by information culled from exploration of the world. Science was useful to imperialism as it guided the exploitation of exotic environments and provided legitimacy to conquest. It is in this respect that botanic gardens as providers of knowledge, aesthetic perfection and agricultural plenty, became instruments of government, by the late eighteenth century in Britain and the British Empire. At the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew, 'improving' the world became a potent argument for both the patronage of science at home and Britain's prerogatives abroad.

Accordingly, the UGC constituted an expert committee to formulate a six-month core module syllabus for environmental studies. This textbook is the outcome of the UGC s efforts and has been prepared as per the syllabus. It is designed to bring about an awareness on a variety of environmental concerns. It attempts to create a pro-environmental attitude and a behavioural pattern in society that is based on creating sustainable lifestyles and a new ethic towards conservation.

It not only makes the student better informed on these concerns, but is expected to lead the student towards positive action to improve the environment. Based on a multidisciplinary approach that brings about an appreciation of the natural world and human impact on its integrity, this textbook seeks practical answers to make human civilization sustainable on the earth s finite resources.

The alternative is Plan B, a worldwide mobilization to stabilize population and climate before these issues spiral out of control. The goal is to stabilize population close to the United Nation's low projection of 7.4 billion, to reduce carbon emissions by half by 2015, and to raise water productivity by half.

9788125034308	Caste And Dalit Lifeworlds:Postcolonial Persp	Debjani Ganguly		Caste and Dalit Lifeworlds attempts to come to terms with the presence of caste in late modern India by asking two questions: How do we read caste today? Why is it no longer enough to brand caste as pre-modern and backward? The author argues that caste is less an essence responsible for India s backwardness as an assemblage of a variety of secular and non-secular practices and affects that generate everyday life in India, while being in a constant state of flux something that cannot be completely contained in a narrative of nation-building, modernization and development. In order to illustrate the importance of reading caste in this light, she turns her archival and analytical focus on both caste Hindu and dalit literary, mythographic and religious texts. The attempt is not to endorse either the caste-system or casteism, but to resist the reified ways in which caste continues to figure in social, scientific and nation-building discources. Ganguly is in this work admirably cosmopolitan: she is at ease with different intellectual cultures, moving in sophisticated ways between the differect perspectives of social science, Historiography, Subaltern studies, theorists of the aesthetic, poststructuralism, postcolonialism. This is a very learned work, familiar with many fields, interdisciplinary in relaxed attentive ways. - John Docker, Australian National University Debjani Ganguly has chosen an intellectually ambitious project, one that demands both archival and interpretational skills. Her attention to caste as a social sign text, narrative, discourse stems from a desire, evidenced everywhere in her book to provide a language for the description of caste identifications and behaviours as part of the dalit `everyday . This is an important move. Homi K Bhabha, Anne F Rothenberg Professor of English and Americal Literature, Harvard University	2008	Orient BlackSwan						ZZZ000000

9788125030669	Culture Of The New Capitalism (Pul),The	Richard Sennett		The distinguished sociologist Richard Sennett surveys major differences between earlier forms of industrial capitalism and the more global, more febrile, ever more mutable version of capitalism that is taking its place. He shows how these changes affect everyday life how the work ethic is changing; how new beliefs about merit and talent displace old values of craftsmanship and achievement; how what Sennett calls the specter of uselessness haunts professionals as well as manual workers; how the boundary between consumption and politics is dissolving. In recent years, reformers of both private and public institutions have preached that flexible, global corporations provide a model of freedom for individuals, unlike the experience of fixed and static bureaucracies Max Weber once called the iron cage. Sennett argues that, in banishing old ills, the new economy model has created new social and emotional traumas. Only a certain kind of human being can prosper in unstable, fragmentary institutions: the culture of the new capitalism demands an ideal self oriented to the short term, focused on potential ability rather than accomplishment, willing to discount or abandon past experience. In a concluding section, Sennett examines a more durable form of selfhood, and what practical initiatives could counter the pernicious effects of reform.	2006	Orient BlackSwan						ZZZ000000

9788178242460	Gandhi's conscience keeper,C. Rajagopalachari and Indian politics	Vasanthi Srinivasan		Hailed by Mahatma Gandhi as his conscience keeper, Chakravarti Rajagopalachari (1878 1972; better known as Rajaji) epitomized the practical wisdom, religious tolerance, and statesmanship that Gandhi brought to the nationalist movement. He articulated how Gandhi s ideas and practices could be reconciled with the needs and aspirations of a modern nation-state. His political and philosophical positions were argued in a manner, and with an ideological orientation, strikingly different from that of Jawaharlal Nehru. And yet Rajaji remains virtually unknown today. Vasanthi Srinivasan presents Rajaji s vision as that of a theocentric liberal. She argues that he tried to temper majoritarian democracy with statesmanship, a free economy with civic virtue, realistic patriotism with genuine internationalism, and secularism with a religiosity derived from the Hindu epics. Examining his political ideas and actions alongside his literary works, as well as in relation to statesmen-ideologues such as Nehru and Periyar, she shows how Rajaji steered clear of ideological dogma and charted an ethic of responsibility.	2009	Permanent Black, in association with the NewIndia Foundation						ZZZ000000

From being a symbol of collective imagination it became a signifier of narrow sectarianism and regional chauvinism.

This pathbreaking book is the first close examination of the inner workings of the Bank, the foundations of its achievements, its propensity for intensifying the problems it intends to cure, and its remarkable ability to take criticism and extend its own reach. Michael Goldman takes us inside World Bank headquarters in Washington, D. C., and then to Bank project sites around the globe. He explains how projects funded by the Bank really work and why community activists struggle against the World Bank and its brand of development. Goldman looks at recent ventures in areas such as the environment, human rights, and good governance and reveals how despite its poor track record the World Bank has acquired greater authority and global power than ever before.

9788178242507	In Burmese Prisons	Sisir K. Bose (ed.)		Subhas Chandra Bose s exile in Burmese prisons from 1924 to 1927 witnessed the transformation of a lieutenant into a leader. During the non-cooperation movement and its aftermath he had wholeheartedly accepted Deshbandhu Chitta Ranjan Das as his political mentor. The apprenticeship was cut short by Deshbandhu s death in June 1925. When Subhas received this terrible news as a prisoner in Mandalay, he felt desolate with a sense of bereavement , as he wrote to his friend Dilip Kumar Roy. Netaji s letters cover a very wide array of topics art, music, literature, nature, education, folk culture, civic affairs, criminology, spirituality, and, of course, politics. He bore the rigours of prison life with a combination of stoicism and humour. This volume is indispensable to an understanding of India s greatest revolutionary leader and will interest all historians of modern India.	2009	Permanent Black						ZZZ000000
9788125034810	In The Presence Of Saibaba:Body,City & Memory	Smriti Srinivas		The Sai Baba movement, centred on the Indian guru Sathya Sai Baba (b.1926), today attracts a global following from Japan to South Africa. Regarded as a divine incarnation, Sathya Sai Baba traces his genealogy to Shirdi Sai Baba (d.1918), a mendicant in colonial India identified with various Sufi and devotional traditions. The movement, thus, has its roots in Shirdi Sai Baba. However, in the process of going global, it has developed conjunctions with other religious traditions, New Religious Movements, and New Age ideas. This book offers an account of the Sai Baba movement as a pathway for charting the varied cartographies, sensory formations, and cultural memories implicated in urbanization and globalization. It traverses the terrain between social theories for the study of religion and cities themselves a product of modernity and the radical, creative, and unexpected modernity of contemporary religious movements. It is based on ethnographic research carried out in India, Kenya, and the United States of America.	2008	Orient BlackSwan						ZZZ000000

9788125026006	The making of Navi Mumbai	Annapurna Shaw		This book uses the case of the Navi Mumbai urban project to bring out many of the problems inherent in the urbanisation process and in the nature of urban policy-making in post-colonial India. It illustrates how even a new city, built from scratch, is riddled with social and economic contradictions---well-planned and serviced areas coexisting with slums and shanties. The work questions some of the accepted solutions to urban policy especially with regard to urban land and distribution of civic infrastructure. Navi Mumbai is being used as a model for building new towns outside other cities in India. This detailed case study of Navi Mumbai reveals the strengths and weaknesses of this model of urbanisation and indicates the policy directions that can obliterate the duality that has characterised the Indian city all through the twentieth century.	2004	Orient Blackswan						ZZZ000000
9788125029120	The making of Southern Karnataka,society, polity and culture in the early medieval period	Malini Adiga		Southern Karnataka emerged as a regional entity between the fourth and eleventh centuries AD. Although interest in the nature of early medieval states and their social formations has defined much historical research since the 1970s, studies have, until now, been limited to clarifying only the political-dynastic history of the region. In this path-breaking new study, Malini Adiga reveals the political, social and cultural features that characterised the region. Its distinct identity is explored by examining the processes that created this political and cultural entity: the various social strata, the nature of the socio-political structure, the developments in the field of religion, and the manner in which the early medieval state patronised and utilised the various religious cults and sects to legitimise itself. Based on an extensive analysis of the inscriptions from the region and period under study, this book also drwas on the region's literary sources to explain its characteristic social ethos. Exhaustively researched, carefully analysed and richly descriptive, this book is essential reading for all those interested in early medieval Karnataka.	2006	Orient Longman						ZZZ000000

9788125036852	Out Of The East: Spices And Medieval Imagina	Paul Freedman		The demand for spices in medieval Europe was extravagant and was reflected in the pursuit of fashion, the formation of taste, and the growth of luxury trade. It is inspired geographical and commercial exploration, as traders pursued such common spices as pepper and cinnamon and rarer aromatic products, including ambergris and musk. Ultimately, the spice quest led to imperial missions that were to change world history. This engaging book explores the demand for spices: why were they so popular, and why so expensive? Paul Freedman surveys the history, geography, economics, and culinary tastes of the Middle Ages to uncover the surprisingly varied ways that spices were put to use- in elaborate medieval cuisine, in the treatment of disease, for the promotion of well-being, and to perfume important ceremonies of the Church. Spices became symbols of beauty, affluence, taste, and grace, Freedman shows, and their expense and fragrance drove the engines of commerce and conquest at the dawn of the modern era.	2009	Orient BlackSwan						ZZZ000000

9788125036838	Shanti Sena: Philosophy History And Action	Thomas Weber		The recent large-scale communal disturbances in India have prompted some older Gandhians to voice the opinion that the time may have come to reactivate the Shanti Sena, Mahatma Gandhi s Peace Army, that did impressive work in promoting communal harmony between the late 1950 s and the mid-1970s. Although the idea of a Shanti Sena was considered to be of fundamental importance by Gandhi, he had little success in setting it up in his lifetime. It took the foresight and efforts of Vinoba Bhave and Jayaprakash Narayan, and the organising ability of Narayan Desai. The history of this peace army that they brought into life and directed is not only an inspiring one, it is also important, given the rise in sectarian violence in India and the recent growth of international peace teams that looks to the Sena for motivation and guidance. Sena members worked in conflict resolution at the grassroots level and undertook peace missions during riots, convinced dacoits to turn themselves into authorities , carried out relief work following wars, experimented with nonviolent defence, conducted nonviolence training camps and even played a role in unarmed peacekeeping work in the international sphere. Relying on interviews with key participants and archival material, this thought-provoking work contributes greatly to the study of a unique experiment in practical nonviolence. This is the first study of its kind that has chronicled in such detail the activities and history of the Shanti Sena during its most active years, and discussed the prospects for its reinvigoration.	2009	Orient BlackSwan						ZZZ000000

9788187358312	The Many Worlds of Sarala Devi,A Diary	Sukhendu Ray&Malavika Karlekar		The modern style of wearing a sari was introduced by Jnanadanandini Devi, a member of the Tagore family. The Tagores and Sartorial Styles: A Photo Essay by Malavika Karlekar along with THE MANY WORLDS OF SARALA DEVI: A Diary (Translated from Jeevaner Jharapata ) by Sukhendu Ray, with an introduction by Bharati Ray comprise a new book from Social Sciences Press, New Delhi. This charming book, as the titles suggest, contain two separate but related writings on the Tagores. The Tagores were a pre-eminent family which became synonymous with the cultural regeneration of India, specifically of Bengal, in the nineteenth century. The first writing is a sensitive translation of Sarala Devi s memoirs from the Bengali, Jeevaner Jharapata, by Sukhendu Ray. It is the first autobiography written by a nationalist woman leader of India. Sarala Devi was Rabindranath Tagore s niece and had an unusual life. The translation unfolds, among other things, what it was like to grow up in a big affluent house Jorasanko, that had more than 116 inmates and a dozen cooks! The second writing by Malavika Karlekar is a photo essay, creatively conceived, visually reflecting the social and cultural trends of the times, through styles of dress, jewellery and accoutrements. The introduction by Bharati Ray perceptively captures the larger context of family, marriage, women s education and politics of the time which touched Sarala Devi s life. She points out that if memoirs are a kind of social history then women s diaries record social influences not found in official accounts and are therefore a rich source of documentation.	2010	Berghahn Books						ZZZ000000

9788125027119	Who wants democracy?	Javeed Alam		From The Moment Of Its Birth Democracy In India Was Plagued By A Deep Anxiety. In 1947, Nehru Saw The Future As A Time To Redeem Pledges, A Time To Fulfil The Hopes That Had Been Aroused During The National Struggle. But He Was Well Aware That This Was A Difficult Task. Reforms Followed, Democratic Instituttions Were Set Up, And Universal Adult Franchise Was Established. But Poverty, Illiteracy And Poor Health Remained Part Of The Post-Colonial Landscape. Why Then Do The Poor And The Malnutrited Return In Every Election To Choose Their Representatives, To Form The Government Of Their Choice?Through An Effort To Answer This Seeming Paradox, Alam Explores The Working Of Democracy In India. Beneath The Play Of Caste And Communal Politics, And The Threats Of Institutional Collapse, Alam Sees Democracy Acquiring A Firm Basis Within Indian Society. He Shows What The Voting Patterns Tell Us About The Links Between Regional Voices And National Unity, Between The Politics Of Community And The Idea Of Citizenship, Between The Commitments Of The Poor And The Apathy Of The Rich.This Is A Tract That Questions Our Common Assumptions And Forces Us To Re-Think Our Ideas About The Life Of Indian Democracy.	2004	Orient Blackswan						ZZZ000000

9788125029397	Reproductive health in India,history, politics, controversies	Sarah Hodges&Centre for the History and Culture of Medicine (University of London. School of Oriental and African Studies)		Within the scholarly fields of demography, development studies, medical anthropology and public policy, the history of reproduction has been dominated by preconceived and often a-historical ideas about India s supposed long-term trend towards over-population. When these scholarly fields have invoked histories of fertility and contraception, these histories have largely been made to serve as the pre-modern antithesis to a fully modern future. In contrast, this volume brings together historians to tackle the complex questions of reproduction in modern India. Taken together, these essays interrogate the very idea that reproduction is simply a linch-pin for effecting other social and economic transformations. Instead, these histories map out and ask questions of the institutions, discourses and practices by which women's reproductive health came to hold meaning and play strategic roles in the multiple and at times competing agendas such as social reform, the medical sciences, cultural nationalism, and colonial public health.	2006	Orient Longman						ZZZ000000
9788125036791	The hospital system and health care,Sri Lanka, 1815-1960	Margaret Jones		There has been an extensive historiographical debate on the role of Western or allopathic medicine in the colonial context. However, most of the literature concentrates on the implementation and significance of public health measures, mental health institutions and the control of epidemic diseases; the role of hospitals per se in this policy transfer has so far not commanded equal attention. An analysis of the medical, cultural and socio-political aspects of hospital development in the colonial context is essential for an understanding of the contribution of Western medicine to the health of indigenous populations and its role in the imperial project.	2009	Orient Blackswan						ZZZ000000

9788125036845	History Of Modern India (English)	Bipan Chandra		History of Modern India presents an authoritative overview of the history of what was known as British India. The text is largely based on the author s research on nationalism and colonialism in India and also draws from the works of eminent historians of the period. Challenging and revising colonial and nationalist interpretations of history, this book moves away from a largely political narrative to a social, economic and religious history of modern India. It explains how conditions in India during the eighteenth century helped the British East India Company establish its rule in India. It also gives us important insights into the primary aim of colonial rule which was the economic exploitation of India through trade and investment. The topics are arranged thematically in order to showcase the various forces that went into the making of independent India. However, in the entire arrangement of themes, the chronology of the period is enmeshed innovatively with the various forces that evolved both as a cause and effect of British imperialist rule of the subcontinent. The book also provides a detailed account of the nationalist movement and introduces us to the contributions of different individuals who were behind the nationalist movement. A comprehensive textbook for students of history and interested readers, History of Modern India is essential reading for a broad based understanding of the making of modern India.	2009	Orient BlackSwan						ZZZ000000
9788178242590	History, bhakti, and public memory,Namdev in religious and secular traditions	Christian Lee Novetzke		Namdev is a central figure in the cultural history of India, especially within the field of bhakti, a devotional practice that has created publics of memory around the figure of Namdev for over eight centuries. Born in the Marathi-speaking region of the Deccan in the late thirteenth century, Namdev is remembered as a simple, low-caste Hindu tailor whose innovative performances of devotional songs spread his fame widely. He is central to many religious traditions within Hinduism, as well as to Sikhism, and he is a key early literary figure in Maharashtra, northern India, and Punjab. In the modern period, Namdev appears throughout the public spheres of Marathi and Hindi and in India at large, where his identity fluctuates between regional associations and a quiet, pan-Indian, nationalist-secularist profile that champions the poor, oppressed, marginalized, and low caste. Christian Lee Novetzke considers the way social memory coheres around the figure of Namdev from the sixteenth century to the present, examining the practices that situate Namdev`s memory in multiple historical publics. Focusing primarily on Maharashtra and drawing on ethnographies of devotional performance, archival materials, scholarly historiography, and popular media, especially film, Novetzke vividly illustrates how religious communities in India preserve their pasts and, in turn, create their own historical narratives.	2009	Permanent Black						ZZZ000000
9788125032489	Madhyakaleen Bharat Rajniti, Samaj Aur Sanskr	Chandra Satish		Madhyakaleen Bharat (written in Hindi) is a book on the history of Medieval India. It covers the period between the eighth century and seventeenth century. Generally, most of the books on the history of medieval India start around 1206, the period of the Turkish invasion and establishment of Turkish rule in parts of north India. The present book Madhyakaleen Bharat breaks this traditional pattern by starting at a much earlier date, from eight century onwards. The four hundred years from the eighth century to twelfth century, although a very significant period in Indian history, is a lesser studied period. The significance of this period lies in the fact that the ancient Indian society was slowly changing and taking a new shape - marked by profound changes in polity, economy, society and culture. Very few books which survey medieval Indian society dig into this period. However, professor Satish Chandra has not only investigated this period, he has ensured that his investigation is comprehensible to the general reader. He is thus able to give a fuller picture of medieval period in India. The present book is written in a textbook format. It is an important book in the sense that it treats the subject-matter in a way which does away with the stereotyped analyses and attitudes and inculcates in the readers, who should largely be college and university students, a fresh attitude towards viewing history. It gives them a general idea of the findings of other important historians and therefore readers can, in a single volume, have glimpses of modern trends of writings on this period. Above all, the book is very readable.	2007	Orient BlackSwan						ZZZ000000
9788125033660	Matters Of Exchange (Pul)	Harold J. Cook		In this wide-ranging and stimulating book, a leading authority on the history of medicine and science presents convincing evidence that Dutch commerce, not religion, inspired the rise of science in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Harold Cook scrutinises a wealth of historical documents relating to the study of medicine and natural history in the Netherlands, Europe, Brazil, South Africa, and Asia during this era, and his conclusions are fresh and exciting. He uncovers direct links between the rise of trade and commerce in the Dutch Empire and the flourishing of scientific investigation. Cook argues that engaging in commerce changed the thinking of Dutch citizens, leading to a new emphasis on such values as objectivity, accumulation, and description. The preference for accurate information that accompanied the rise of commerce also laid the groundwork for the rise of science globally, wherever the Dutch engaged in trade. Medicine and natural history were fundamental aspects of this new science, as reflected in the development of gardens for both pleasure and botanical study, anatomical theatres, curiosity cabinets, and richly illustrated books about nature. Sweeping in scope and original in its insights, this book revises previous understandings of the history of science and ideas.	2008	Orient BlackSwan						ZZZ000000

She Shows That Vaid Practitioners Engaged With The Scientific Authority Of Western Medicine In The Colony Through Writings And Other Efforts In A Print-Based Public Sphere. Facing Both Threat And Competition, Local Practitioners Were Forced To Address And Propagate New Forms Of Medical Reason To Legitimise And Revalidate The Indigenous Scientific Basis Of Their Learning. In Part, This Meant Reinterpreting Ayurved S Claims To Status And Authority.This Book Also Explores The Engagements Between Ayurved And Yunani Indigenous Practices, Thereby Looking Beyond The Confining Binaries Of Asian And Western Medical Systems. It Argues For An Understanding Of The Contextual Politics Of Indigenous Medicine As A Fluid And Complex Body Of Ideas As Well As Representations Of Religious Identities And Linguistic Alignments. Vaid Claims To Patronage And Representation Now Meant Nothing Less Than Recasting Vaid Identity In Punjab; And This Was Marked By Irregular Alignments And Multiple Imaginings. In Showing This, The Author Suggests New Perspectives On Hindu Reformist Politics, Its Ambiguities And Fractures. Patrons And Publicists In The Medical Public Sphere Were Forging New Forms Of Sikh Community Identity And A Hindu Nation-In-The-Making, Even As They Were, Simultaneously And Disparately, Projecting An Altered Vocabulary Of Ayurvedic Learning In Hindi And Gurmukhi.Drawing Upon Years Of Fieldwork Across Punjab, Kavita Sivaramakrishnan Examines, Alongside The Standard Archives, A Vast Number Of Vernacular Pamphlets, Tracts And Magazines Many For The First Time. This Is Supplemented And Enriched By Interviews With Ayurvedic Practitioners And Families Of Hereditary Practitioners, As Well As Data From Private Collections And Diaries That Have Never Been Accessed Until Now.	2006-01-01	Orient Longman						ZZZ000000

9788125030171	Refiguring unani tibb,plural healing in late colonial India	Guy N. A. Attewell		Refiguring Unani Tibb Examines The Ways In Which Unani Tibb Reconstituted Its Identity In The Light Of Modernising Trends At The Turn Of The Twentieth Century In India. It Brings Out The Heterogeneity Of Unani Tibb In Late Colonial India That Frequently Defies Its Commonly Ascribed Label As A Traditional Muslim System Of Medicine. Through An Analysis Of Interconnecting Themes Guy Attewell Draws Attention To The Tensions Manifest In Different Spheres Of Unani Activity As Practitioners Reconfigured Their Knowledge And Practices Through The Prisms Of Biomedical Concepts, Language, Nationalist And Communitarian Politics, Changing Social And Moral Norms, And Colonial-Inspired Models Of Legitimacy. The Book Shows That While Tibb Has Always Been A Cosmopolitan Profession, The Late Nineteenth And Twentieth Centuries Saw A Fundamental Transition From A Principally Localised, Personalised Practice To One That Had To Engage And Be Represented In A Mass, Public Arena For Status, Recognition And Custom. This Transition, The Book Argues, Was Neither Complete Nor Uniform. The Study Draws On A Range Of Material In Urdu, Arabic And Persian, Including Texts, Pamphlets And Journals, In Addition To Archival Records In Hyderabad And London, To Draw Out The Complexity And Contingency In The Evolution Of A Plural And Extraordinarily Dynamic Tradition Of Healing.	2007-07-01	Orient Longman						ZZZ000000

9788178242552	The small voice of history,collected essays	Ranajit Guha&Partha Chatterjee		Ranajit Guha`s writings have had a formative impact on several disciplines: postcolonial studies, literature, anthropology, history cultural studies, art history. Guha first became known as the practitioner of a critical Marxism that ran parallel to the work of British and French Marxist historians of the 1960s and 1970s but which, instead of recreating a `history from below, sought active political engagement by deploying insights drawn from Gramsci and Mao. More recently, Cuba`s work has drawn attention to the phenomenological and the everyday, and been noticed for its critique of the disciplinary practices of history-writing. Guha`s reputation rests most famously on his role as the founder and guiding spirit of Subaltern Studies, which has critiqued colonialist and nationalist historiographies. In spawning new ways of thinking about history, this has created an intellectual ferment richer than anything else emerging out of modern South Asia. Guha`s historical and political writings, tucked away in obscure journals and collections, have been virtually inaccessible; they are brought together for the first time in the present volume by Partha Chatterjee, whose long association with Guha as a founder-member of the Subaltern Studies editorial board is complemented by his own international stature as a historian, political theorist, and public intellectual. Every serious student of South Asian history, politics, and anthropology will be enriched by the astonishing diversity of insights and scholarship within this book.	2009	Permanent Black						ZZZ000000
9788187358374	Writing history in the Soviet Union,making the past work	Arup Banerji		The history of the Soviet Union has been charted in several studies over the decades. However, earlier examinations have failed to draw attention to the political and academic environment within which these histories were composed. Identifying the significant hallmarks of the production of Soviet history by Soviet as well as Western historians, this book attempts to fill this gap. It shows how the Russian Revolution of 1917 triggered a shift in official policy towards historians and the publication of history textbooks for schools and surveys the rich body of writing the Russian Revolution generated as well as the divergent approaches to the history of the period. The conditions for research in Soviet archives are described as an aspect of official monitoring of history writing, which continues to this day.	2008-07-01	Berghahn Books						ZZZ000000

As she chronicles the clash of ideas, social movements, and armed conflicts that have played a part in this struggle, Ishay illustrates how the concept of human rights has evolved from one era to another through texts, cultural traditions, and creative expression. Writing with verve and extraordinary range in the only comprehensive history of human rights available, she develops a framework for understanding contemporary issues from the debate over globalization to the intervention in Kosovo to the post-September 11 climate for human rights.	2008	Orient BlackSwan						ZZZ000000

9788125032168	Government Brahmana	Dharani Devi Malagatti		Government Brahmana is the English translation of the Kannada autobiography of Aravind Malagatti. The autobiographical narrative is in the form of a series of episodes from the author s childhood and youth. These episodes function as what G.N. Devy calls epiphanic moments in a caste society. The author reflects on specific instances from his childhood and student days that illustrate the normative cruelty practiced by caste Hindu society on dalits. We encounter all the tropes of (male) dalit life: is isolation in school where even drinking water is an ordeal; life in the village where dalits perform the filthiest tasks but are denied access to common wells, lakes, where they cannot step into shops and therefore have their purchases thrown at them, where they have to cut their own hair because no barber would touch it; consuming dead-animal meat and innards; doomed love affairs with `upper caste women. A painful, disturbing, thought-provoking memoir, this text is conversely full of vitality, even tenderness. In its structure and purpose as a series of notes towards a dalit autobiography Government Brahmana appears to be anticipated by Ambedkar s own autobiographical sketches.	2007	Orient Longman						ZZZ000000

9788125027751	India abroad,diasporic cultures of postwar America and England	Sandhya Shukla		India Abroad analyses the development of Indian diasporas in the United States and England from 1947, the year of Indian independence, to the present. Across different spheres of culture---festivals, enterpreneurial enclaves, fiction, autobiography, newspapers, music and film---migrants have created India as a way to negotiate life in the multicultural United States and Britain. Sandhya Shukla considers how Indian diaspora has become a contact zone for various formations of identity and disclosures of nation. She suggests that carefully reading the production of a diasporic sensibility, one that is not simply an outgrowth of the nation-state, helps us to conceive of multiple imaginaries, of America, England, and India, as articulated to one another. Both the connections and disconnections among peoples who see themselves as in some way Indian are brought into focus by this comparativist approach. This book provides a unique combination of rich ethnographic work and textual readings to illuminate the theoretical concerns central to the growing fields of diaspora studies and transnational cultural studies. Shukla argues that the multi-sitedness of diaspora compels a rethinking of time and space in anthropology, as well as in other disciplines. Necessarily, the standpoint of global belonging and citizenship makes the boundaries of the America in American studies a good deal more porous. And in dialogue with South Asian studies and Asian American studies, this book situates postcolonial Indian subjectivity within migrants' transnational recastings of the meanings of race and ethnicity. Interweaving conceptual and material understandings of diaspora, India Abroad finds that in constructed Indias, we can see the contradictions of identity and nation that are central to the globalised condition in which all peoples, displaced and otherwise, live	2005	Orient Longman						ZZZ000000

The 'kittens' of his title are the offspring of Schrodinger's famously indeterminate cat, and their adventures as they are carried to opposite ends of the nuiverse, are a neat way of visualizing the many perplexing paradoxes of new view of reality.

9788125035091	Power and contestation,India since 1989	Nivedita Menon And Aditya Nigam		The year1989 marks the unraveling of India s Nehruvian Consensus of a modern, secular nation with a self-reliant economy. Caste and religion have come to play major roles in national politics. Global economic integration has led to conflict between the state and dispossessed people, but processes of globalization have also enabled new spaces for political assertion, such as around sexuality. Older challenges to the state continue in Kashmir and the North-East, while Maoist insurgency has deepened its bases. In a world of American Empire, India as a nuclear power has abandoned non-alignment, a shift that is contested by voices within. Power and Contestation shows that the turbulence and turmoil of this period are signs of India s continued vibrancy and democracy. The book is an ideal introduction to the complex internal histories and external power relations of a major global player in the new century.	2008	Orient Longman Private						ZZZ000000

9788125033653	In Amma'S Healing Room (Pul)	Joyce Flueckige		In Amma s Healing Room is a vivid and compelling study of the life and thought of a female Muslim spiritual leader Amma to her family and disciples who lives and practices in the city of Hyderabad in South India. Joyce Burkhalter Flueckiger describes Amma s practice as a form of vernacular Islam that has arisen in a particular locality, one in which the boundaries between Islam, Hinduism and Christianity are fluid. In the healing room, Amma meets a diverse clientele that includes men as well as women, and people of various religious and social backgrounds. Seated at a small table, writing amulets in Arabic while her husband, Abba, himself a Sufi master, operates a small store catering to the waiting crowd, Amma advises her disciples, who come to her with a wide range of physical, social and physiological afflictions. Even as she declares that the most important distinction among humans is that of gender, not religion, Amma crosses those boundaries to practice in a traditionally male ritual role, and must continually recreate and maintain her authortity as healer to meet the public . Flueckiger s collaboration with Amma over a number of years is an integral part of the story she tells. Much of Amma s complex cosmology is presented in her own words. The author describes her research methods and growing understanding of her material in terms of a deepening relationship with Amma, to whom she related at different moments as daughter, disciple and researcher. The resulting study is a work of insight and compassion that challenges widely held views of religion and gender in India as it reveals the creativity of a tradition too often portrayed by Muslims and non-Muslims alike as singular and monolithic.	2008	Orient BlackSwan						ZZZ000000

It is a comprehensive critical introduction to the relationship between US hegemony and contemporary globalisation. Many introductory textbooks on globalisation tend to be simplistic and conservative. This book moves things forward, providing a critical review of the globalisation debate. Kiely argues that we can only approach a proper understanding of the contemporary world order by linking globalisation to debates on capitalism, imperialism and universal human rights. He explores US hegemony in this light, showing how liberal internationalism cannot be separated from capitalism, neo-liberalism and US empire building. Covering all the major issues, from globalisation theory to international economics, cultural imperialism and global governance, this will be of interest to anyone looking for a refreshing analytical approach.	2007	Orient BlackSwan						ZZZ000000

Expunging Variola Reveals These As It Chronicles The Last Three Decades Of The Anti-Smallpox Campaigns In India.This Wide-Ranging Study, Based On Extensive Archival Research In India, Britain, Switzerland And The United States Of America, Assesses The Many Complexities In The Formulation And Implementation Of The Smallpox Eradication Programme In The Subcontinent. Rather Than Merely Cataloguing The Developments Of This Extremely Complex Exercise Within The World Health Organisation Headquarters In Geneva And The Indian Central Government In New Delhi, This Book Adopts A Much Broader Perspective: It Makes A Conscious Effort To Provide A Detailed View By Including The Accounts Of Who, Governmental And Nongovernmental Personnel On The Ground.

It Is A Close-Up Of A Peasant Economy In The Throes Of A Crisis Which Temporarily Eroded The Value-System Determining The Normal Pattern Of Entitlements. An Investigation Of The Socio-Economic, Ecological And Cultural Determinants Of The Famine Helps Evolve A Coherent Framework. The Emphasis Is On The Distinctive Problems Of The Various Economic Regions, Most Notably The Tribal Belts.Chakrabarti Applies Amartya Sen'S Theory Of Exchange Entitlements To A Nineteenth Century Famine Situation In Bengal, And Finds That A Market-Based Entitlement Failure Precipitating Severe Famine Conditions, Even Without Receiving Any Impulse From Food Production , Has Little Relevance Here.Though Teh Book Underlines The Predicament Of The Subalterns, The Famine Is Not Seen From The Viewpoint Of Any Specific Group Or Community. The Focus Is, Rather, On The Phenomenon Of Famine In Its Totality---On The Agony And Trauma Of A Peasant Society Thrown Out Of Gear In An Abnormal Situation, And The Crisis Of Identities That Ensued.	2004	Orient Blackswan						ZZZ000000

These Writers, All Of Whom Are Jewish, Experienced The Holocaust, The Second World War, And In The Case Of Buber, The Question Of Israel And Palestine. In The Work Of All Three Are Woven Stands Of Resistance, Issues Of Suffering, And Questions Of Meaning In An Increasingly Inhuman World. We Also Find Issues Of Personal Religious/Spiritual Faith-The Faith Of One'S Birth, And That Of The Other. While Simone Weil'S Work Speaks Of Her Work In The Resistance, And Also Her Life Among The Workers, Buber Attempts To Solve The Issue Of West Asia Through Dialogue And Acceptance And By Seeing The Land As Belonging To Both Arabs And Jews.Dr Visvanathan Goes On To Examine The Friendship Between Gandhi, Rudra And Andrews - A Friendship That Made It Possible For A Christian Mission College(St.Stephens In Delhi) To Participate In The Freedom Movement And To Crate An Identity That Was Simultaneously Nationalist Indian And Christian. This Paper Supplements One That Traces How The British Presence In India - First As Traders, Then Later As Imperial Rulers - Negotiated Its Relationship With Christian Missionaries, Both European And Indian, And With Indian Religious. This Relationship, Marked By An Absence Of Dialogue, Was Attempted To Be Set Right In The Hindu Christian Ashrams Of Fr. Monchanin, Dom Henri Le Saux And Dom Bede Griffiths.Two Chapters Are Devoted To Henri Le Saux, The French Monk Who Became A Sanyasi And A Devotee Of Shri Ramana And Arunachala, While Remaining A Devout Christian. Dr Visvanathan Discusses This As An Aspect Of The Dialogue Of Cultures And Religious Within Le Saux'S/Abhishiktananda'S Self, Indeed Of The Dialogue Within, Between Le Saux And Abhishiktananda.Dr Visvanathan Poses Dialogue As A Real And Hopeful Alternative To Pessimistic And Violent Notions Of Civilisational Clashes.	2007-07-01	Orient Longman						ZZZ000000

9788125027423	Gender, politics, and Islam	Therese Saliba&Carolyn Allen&Judith A. Howard		In A Time Of Increasing Hostility Towards Islam, This Collection Extends The Boundaries Of Global Feminism To Include Islamic Women. Challenging Orientalist Assumptions Of Muslim Women As Victims Of Islam And Islamic Fundamentalism, These Groundbreaking Essays Focus On The Complex Relations Of Power That Shape Women'S Negotiations For Identity, Power, And Agency As Participants In Religious, Cultural And Nationalist Movements. This Book Brings Together Signs Essays On Women In The Middle East, South Asia, And The Diaspora, From Bangladesh, Canada, Egypt, Iran, Israel/Palestine, Pakistan, And Yemen To Explore How Women Negotiate Indigenous Identities And Attempt To Gain Political, Economic, And Legal Rights.This Collection Shows That Islam Is A Heterogeneous Set Of Historically And Contexually Variable Practices And Beliefs Shaped By Region, Nation, Ethnicity, Sect, And Class, As Well As By Responses To Local And Transnational Cultural And Economic Processes. In Examining Women'S Participation In Religious And Nationalist Projects, These Critics Debate Controversial Issues: Does Islamic Feminism Provide An Alternative, Possibly Revolutionary Paradigm, To Eurocentric Liberal Humanism And The Individualism Of Western Feminism? Is Islam Any More Oppressive To Women Than The Workings Of The Modern Secular State? How Are The Lives And Texts Of Arab And Muslim Women Discursively Constructed For Local Or Western Consumption? These Essays Expose The Shortcomings Of The Secularist Assumptions Of Many Recent Feminist Analyses, Which Continue To Treat Religion In General And Fundamentalism In Particular As A Problematic Tool Of Oppression Used Against Women, Rather Than As A Viable Form Of Feminist Agency That Produces Contradictory Effects For Women Participants.	2004	Orient Blackswan						ZZZ000000
9788125027973	Gendered citizenship,historical and conceptual explorations	Anupama Roy		Adopting A Historical Conceptual Approach, This Book Examines The Gendering Of Citizenship. It Argues That Through Successive Historical Periods, `Becoming A Citizen Has Involved A Gradual Extension Of The Status, To More And More Persons And Groups, In Particular, Women, Which Resulted In A More Inclusive And Egalitarian Structure. But, The Promise Of Equal Membership In The Politcal Community Masks The Exclusionary Framework That Defines Citizenship As Found In Caste Hierarchies, Gender Differences, And Divides Between Religious Communities Based On Majority And Minority Status. Engaging With Contemporary Debates On Citizenship That Place Themselves Within The Framework Of Multiculturalism And World Citizenship This Work Asserts The Need To Redefine The Notion Of Community By Focussing On Citizenship As A Measure Of Activity And Practice, And By Exposing The Subtleties Of Role Definition Of Women Implicit In Community Norms.	2005	Orient Blackswan						ZZZ000000

9788125005117	Kings and political leaders of the Gorkhali Empire, 1768-1814	Mahesh Chandra Regmi		Looking at history as a study of change, the author argues that the mainspring of change in the economy and society of the Gorkhali Empire of the eighteenth century is to be found not among the peasantry but in the political decision of the hill state of Gorkha to expand its territories. The king and the ruling elite reaped direct benefits from territorial expansion but for the workers and peasants, territorial expansion meant over-taxation, enslavement, forced labour services and other burdens. The book argues that the workers and peasants paid not only for the ambitions of their kings and political leaders, but also for their follies and rivalries.	1995	Orient Longman						ZZZ000000

9788125033103	Rethinking 1857	Bhattacharya Sa		Rethinking 1857, edited by Sabyasachi Bhattacharya, marking the one hundred and fiftieth anniversary of 1857, explores the possibilities and limits of recent thinking on the 1857 Uprising. The way we interrogate the past differs from generation to generation. The questions we ask today are moulded by the concerns of our times. Coming from perceptibly different points of departure, the contributors of this volume converge on one central theme: gaining new insights into the events and people that made 1857. This anthology includes fifteen essays divided into four thematic groups. The first theme is the questioning of the conventional historiography of 1857. The second theme is the impact of 1857 on tribal and dalit communities who have been marginalised by the mainstream of Indian society, as well as by dominant traditions in historiography. The third group considers uprisings in regions beyond the north Indian Gangetic heartland, which have scarcely merited mention in the narratives of 1857 till recent times. Finally, the last theme is the alternative polity that was posited, briefly and without success, during the Uprising of 1857 -- an area that has hardly been dealt with by historians. Including an extensive introduction by the editor, Rethinking 1857 brings together some of the papers presented at a conference organised by the Indian Council of Historical Research to mark the one hundred and fiftieth anniversary of the 1857 Uprising.	2008	Orient BlackSwan						ZZZ000000

Lourdusamy		This Book Gives A Flavour Of The Indian Response To Modern Science By Analysing The Lives And Careers Of Four Scientifically Influential Personalities In Bengal. His Analysis Of The Careers Of Two Scientists, J. C. Bose And P. C. Ray, And Two Institution Builders, Mahendralal Sircar And Asutosh Mookerjee, Brings To Light The Issues Related To Science At A Time Of Colonialism And Nationalism. Scientists Often Had To Depend On British Institutions For Legitimation And Funding, While Also Supporting The Nationalist Cause For Greater Autonomy.One Of The Central Claims Of This Book Is That The Protagonists Aimed To Contribute To A Modern World Science, One Based On A Strong Sense Of Universalism. They Did Not Aim To Construct Any Alternative Sciences, Though They Did Express And Apply Their Work By Drawing On Their Cultural Heritage. This Makes Science And National Consciousness A Work Of Particular Relevance Today, When A Homogenous, Instrumentalist And Totally Western Conception Of Science Is Being Globally Accepted.	2004	Orient Blackswan						ZZZ000000

A Travelogue Is Usually A Crucial Political/Aesthetic Text. Its Very Fabric Is Structured In Space And Power - It Creates, Relates, Compares And Contrasts Spaces And Powers. Bengalis Travelling To Europe In The Colonial Period Felt Compelled To Produce Such Texts.

Their Depictions Of The Reality Of The Colonial Metropolis Served As Acts Of Self-Assertion, Dislocating England From Its Position Of Centrality.Simonti Sen Studies In Detail The Conflicted Narratives Of Minds That Aimed To Reconcile A Western Education With An Incipient Sense Of National Self. In Doing So, She Raises Issues Regarding National Definition Which Are As Relevant Today As They Were A Century Ago.

9788125028000	The view from below,indigenous society, temples, and the early colonial state in Tamilnadu, 1700-1835	Kanakalatha Mukund		How Did The British Colonial Administration View The Tamil Natives? How Did The Natives, In Turn, View The Colonial Power Brokers? Underscoring A Transactional Rather Than One-Way Reality Of Colonial Politics, The View From Below Is A Balancing Act Of Scholarship. Kanakalatha Mukund Considers The 'Attitudes' And 'Responses' As Dialogic, Whereby The Colonial State And Indigenous Society Are Locked In A Fierce But Subtle Combat For Attention And Dominance In The Madras Region. The Tamil Institution Upon Which Mukund Focuses Her Study For The Most Part Is The Temple. Moving Further On From This Politically Crucial And Socially Focal Site, The Study Covers A Number Of Other Related Phenomena: The Staging Of Sectarian And Caste Conflicts Aimed To Seize The Control Of The Temples; The New Social Leadership And Patterns Of Patronage; The Construction Of Identity By Aspiring Elite Groups Of Both Parties; And The Folk Representations Of Poligar Rebellions.This Book Will Be Useful To Historians, Anthropologists And Specialists On South India, And Those Interested In The History Of Madras.	2005	Orient Blackswan						ZZZ000000

9788180280177	Women in colonial India,essays on politics, medicine, and historiography	Geraldine Hancock Forbes		The lives of Indian women began to change significantly in the late nineteenth century when the colonial government, critical of the treatment of both Hindu and Muslim women, found allies among Indian reformers. Keen to reform their own society, these men agreed that women should be educated and play some role in public life. By the end of the nineteenth century, Indian women were attending schools and colleges, becoming teachers and doctors, writing works of fiction and essays about their condition, joining organizations to promote social reform, and participating in political meetings. They were referred to as "new women," and like the next generation who joined the freedom movement, they entered public spaces reserved for men. This collection of essays on politics, medicine and historiography is about these women, as participants in nationalist politics and colonial schemes to provide western medicine for women, and as subjects of women's history.	2005	Orient Blackswan						ZZZ000000

9788125030461	Women, Development And The U N (Pul)	D Jain		In Women Development and the UN, internationally noted development economist and activist Devaki Jain traces the ways in which women have enriched the work of the United Nations from the time of its founding in 1945. Synthesizing insights from the extensive literature on women and development and from her own broad experience, Jain reviews the evolution of the UN s programmes aimed at benefiting the women of developing nations and the impact of women s ideas about rights, equality and, social justice on UN thinking and practice regarding development. Jain presents this history from the perspective of the southern hemisphere which recognizes that development issues often look different from the standpoint of countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America. The history that Jain chronicles reveals both the achievements committed networks of women in partnership with UN and the urgent work remaining to bring equality and justice to the world and women.	2006	Orient BlackSwan						ZZZ000000

9788125023449	Ayodhya, archaeology after demolition,a critique of the "new" and "fresh" discoveries	Dhaneshwar Mandal		Archaeology has become implicated in the Ayodhya controversy. It has been claimed that archaeological evidence provides irrefutable proof of the existence of a Rama Temple at the site of Babri Masjid, and of the destruction of this temple by Babur. The author uses standard archaeological procedures to question the claim. He examines the structural and artefactual evidence and analyses the stratigraphic information of B. B. Lal s excavations. Exploring possible alternative interpretations of the available data, he concludes that there was no temple of stone or brick lying below the mosque, and that there is no evidence of any act of destruction. The book is a defence of archaeology against its political misuse. A cautious examination of the archaeological evidence reveals a great deal about the working of communal politics. The archaeological discoveries which are supposed to prove the demolition of a Rama temple by Babur actually show no more than the logic of a politics which destroyed the Babri Masjid on 6 December 1992.	2003	Orient Blackswan						ZZZ000000

Founded in 1600, the East India Company was the forerunner of the modern multinational. Starting life as a trader in Asian Spices, the Company ended its days running Britain s Indian empire. In the process, it shocked its contemporaries with the scale of its violence, corruption and speculation. This is the first-ever book to expose the truth about the Company s social record. Robins reveals a hidden story of tragedy and intrigue. War, famine, stock-market bubbles and even duels between rival executives are all to be found in this new account. For Robins, the Company s legacy provides compelling lessons on how to ensure the accountability of today s global business.	2006	Orient BlackSwan						ZZZ000000

9788125037033	Crises and creativities,middle-class bhadralok in Bengal, c. 1939-52	Amit Kumar Gupta		The 1940s was the decade of crisis and change in Bengal. The years that began with famine, war and devastation ended with rioting, death and mass migration as a land, its people and its soul were partitioned. In the darkness of terrible human tragedy, however, twinkled significant triumphs of human achievement. Bengali intellectualism flourished on either side of Independence, and new landmarks were erected in thought, art and aesthetics. The bhadralok, a multilayered social category comprising educated professionals, translatable literally as gentlemen and as middle class in socioeconomic terms confronted change with a mix of radicalism and reaction. The loftiness of the resultant intellectual product was in inverse proportion to the drastic fall in the general conditions of life. Littérateurs and artists broke out of the elitism of their predecessors to experiment with new forms, and thinkers and theoreticians adapted the philosophical debates of 20th century Europe to contemporary Indian circumstances. This book is an account of the Bengali bhadralok s distinctive creative response to historical circumstances that remain without parallel in the rest of India in the years both before and after their passage. It evaluates aesthetic resurgence in socio-economic perspective, following its many twists and turns, and mapping its essentially non-conformist, liberating and egalitarian spirit. It will be of great interest to students of social crisis and cultural change, and everyone seeking to appraise artistic responses to historical realities.	2009	Orient BlackSwan						ZZZ000000

9788125036869	Disability And Society: A Reader	Adlakha&Blume&Devlie		In the 1980 s disabled scholars in the West began to develop a radical critique of biomedical conceptions of disability that focused exclusively on the individual body and its limitations. They also exposed the failure of the social sciences to critically address what this medical understanding of disability meant, and what it excluded from consideration. Out of their work emerged what is generally called the social model of disability. Over the past twenty years this perspective has generated a substantial literature, much of it making use of the methods of qualitative social research. Narratives and life histories produced by disabled people themselves have a central place in the Disability Studies literature. This work has major implications for professionals in the rehabilitation field, for the social sciences, and the ultimate goal, for the full integration of disabled people into society. However almost all of if focuses on the traditions, practices and dilemmas of northern countries. In India, in Thailand and in most of Asia, the field of disability continues to be dominated by the biomedical model. Thus, disability is understood as an incurable chronic illness and, increasingly, an object for medical diagnosis and investigation. Despite many positive developments, little convergence between disability politics and practice on the one hand, and sociology and anthropology on the other has taken place. Surveying the international literature on disability and rehabilitation, it becomes apparent that many studies carried out in Asian countries are designed to measure the extent of (unmet) need or the impact of services or attitudes to disabled people. Virtually no studies make use of the innovative, usually qualitative and often holistic approaches developed in Western countries over the past twenty years. This book introduces readers in Asian countries to the recent disability literature of the West. The editors hope that it will inspire new thinking among social scientist, rehabilitation professionals and organizations of disabled people themselves that could further the empowerment of people with disabilities.	2009	Orient BlackSwan						ZZZ000000

Lester Brown argues the latter, pointing out that treating the environment as part of the economy has produced an economy that is destroying its natural support system. In this book, Brown describes how to restructure the global economy to make it compatible with the earth s eco-system so that economic progress can continue.	2002	Orient Blackswan						ZZZ000000

But it will take diverse social forms even if these must be based on an acceptance of certain imperatives and principles common to all peoples in both North and South.

9788125033868	Eliminating Human Poverty (Pul)	Enrique Delamonica Santosh Mehrotra		This book focuses on the provision of basic social services in particular, access to education, health and water supplies as the central building blocks of any human development strategy. The authors concentrate on how these basic social services can be financed and delivered more effectively to achieve the internationally agreed Millennium Development Goals. Their analysis, which departs from the dominant macroeconomic paradigm, deploys, the results of the broad-ranging research they led at UNICEF and the UNDP, investigating the record on basic social services of some thirty developing countries. In seeking to learn from the new data from this research, they develop an analytical argument around two potential synergies; at the macro-level, between poverty reduction, human development and economic growth, and at the micro-level, between interventions to provide basic social services. Policymakers, they argue, can integrate macroeconomic and social policy. Fiscal, monetary, and other macroeconomic policies can be compatible with social-sector requirements. The authors make the case that policymakers have more flexibility than is usually suggested by orthodox writers and international financial institutions, and that if policymakers engaged in alternative macroeconomic and growth-oriented policies, this could lead to the expansion of human capabilities and the fulfillment of human rights. This book explores some of these policy options. Eliminating Human poverty also argues that more than just additional aid is needed. Specific strategic shifts in the areas of aid policy, decentralized governance, health and education policy and the private-public mix in service provision are prerequisites to achieving the goals of human development. The combination of governance reforms and fiscal and macroeconomic policies outlined in this book can eliminate human poverty in the span of a generation.	2008	Orient BlackSwan						ZZZ000000

In this process, it examines the role of Bal Gangadhar Tilak and draws attention to issues concerning education, gender, caste, peasantry and communalism, how these were interlinked and had a decisive influence on his anti-colonial nationalism. The study also deconstructs the categories of the moderate and the extremist, the reformer and the orthodox and questions the validity of calling reformers like M. G. Ranade, G. K. Gokhale, N. G. Chandavarkar and G. G. Agarkar as moderates, collaborators and compradors of colonial rule.	2010	Orient BlackSwan						ZZZ000000

9788125039488	Hindu Myths	Dallapiccola A L		India has long been regarded as the home of Hinduism, its mythology constituting the backbone of Indian culture. The myths have been adapted over the centuries to incorporate new or revised characters and continue to play a central role in modern Indian life. Retold here in their colourful and dramatic splendour, they touch on the key narrative themes of creation, preservation, destruction, delusion and the bestowal of grace. They also portray the main deities of the Hindu pantheon Shiva, Vishnu and Devi and their relationships with anti-gods, nymphs and ascetics. Drawn from a variety of sources, most notably the encyclopaedic texts the Puranas, the myths range from the early centuries ad to the sixteenth century, conveying their enduring appeal and the religious teachings derived from them. This books contains 37 illustrations.	2010	Orient BlackSwan						ZZZ000000

9788125039495	Persian Myths	Vesta Sarkhosh Curtes		The traditional tales and stories of ancient Iran describe confrontations between good and evil, the victories of the gods, and exploits of heroes and fabulous supernatural creatures such as the magical bird Simurgh and the div or demons. Much of our information about Iran s pre-Islamic past comes from the holy book of the Zoroastrian religion, the Avesta. Although not written down in its present form until the thirteenth or fourteenth century, parts of the Avesta date back originally to between 1400 and 1200 bc. As well as the words of the prophet Zoroaster and stories about Ahura Mazda, the Wise Lord, it also incorporates earlier pagan myths which reappear in the Shahnameh (Book of Kings). A magnificent epic in rhyme completed in ad1010 by the poet Firdowsi and featuring his most famous hero, Rustum. Dr Curtis draws upon all of these sources to retell for modern readers the stirring legends of ancient Iran, which have inspired centuries of manuscript illustrations. This book contains 42 illustrations.	2010	Orient BlackSwan						ZZZ000000

With Its Focus On The Austere Figure Of The Monk And The Biography Of The Historical Buddha, And More Recently With Its Emphasis On Individualizing Meditation And On Gender Equality, Theravada Buddhism Contrasts Sharply With The Highly Ritualized Tantric Buddhism Traditionally Practiced In The Kathmandu Valley.	2008-12-01	Social Science Press						ZZZ000000

9788125029441	Science, agriculture and the politics of policy,the case of biotechnology in India	Ian Scoones		Science, Agriculture and the Politics of Policy examines the intersections of globalisation, technology and politics through a detailed, empirically-based examination of agricultural biotechnology in India. The focus is on Bangalore and Karnataka, a part of India which has seen a massive growth in biotech enterprises, experimentation with GM cotton and a contested policy debate about the role biotechnology should play in economic development. The book asks what does this new suite of technologies mean - for society, for politics and for the way agriculture, food and rural livelihoods are thought about? Can biotech deliver a second Green Revolution, and so transform agriculture and rescue the countryside and its people from crisis and poverty? Or is it more complex than this? Through a detailed case study, the aim of the book is to discuss, question and refine these broader debates, locating an understanding of biotechnology firmly within an understanding of society and politics.	2006	Orient Blackswan						ZZZ000000

9788125035466	State of vaccination,the fight against smallpox in colonial Burma	Atsuko Naono&Wellcome Trust Centre for the History of Medicine at UCL.		Researched in both London and Burma, State of Vaccination examines how a colonial medical establishment attempted to cope with the neglect that came from being on the periphery of British India. In Burma, local medical officers often doubled up as field officers, laboratory scientists, veterinarians, and teachers to compensate for the weak reach of the colonial state and the chronic shortages of funding and staff. More autonomy was surrendered to local colonial medical officers and the success of the vaccination effort was more vulnerable than in the presidencies to the limitations of transportation, preservation, and legislation, on the one hand, and the challenges of large-scale immigration, local inoculation, and indigenous resistance, on the other. By emphasizing the importance of the colonial medical sub-terrain on the periphery of British India, Atsuko Naono profiles the civil surgeon and his interactions with the local landscape. This book makes an important contribution to our understanding of the history of colonial medicine in Asia. This study begins in the nineteenth century, when Burma came under British rule after three successive wars, and ends with the constitutional separation from India in 1937. Compared to other areas that were a part of British India, Burma rarely figures in studies of colonial health in the British Empire. As a useful countervailing example of medicine under the Raj, incongruities between the colonial medicine practiced on the subcontinent and its periphery Burma are highlighted.	2009	Orient Blackswan						ZZZ000000

9788125028659	Strengthen Your Writing (Rev 3Rd Edn)	V. R. Narayanaswami		`Strengthen Your Writing is an intensive course in writing that promotes the understanding and practice of the essential aspects of English composition and related study skills relevant to students at the intermediate and first-year degree levels. The book is designed to help students acquire and reinforce their writing skills in English in preparation for a successful academic and professional life. The revised edition includes a range of fresh texts based on themes that are modern as well as interesting. Skills not relevant or infrequently used have been omitted and new skills such as writing e-mail messages, memorandums and résumés, which are demanded of students today, have been introduced. There are well-explained models to illustrate different forms of writing as well as a large number of revised, contextualised exercises that provide students with sufficient opportunity for practice. Also included in the book are brief notes in shaded boxes on topics like bias-free writing and the use of parallel structure in composition, which would be of value to students aiming to improve their writing skills in English. Finally, the chapters in the new edition have been reorganised to lead students slowly from simple writing skills to more complex ones, and the book concludes with a unit that shows how graphics can be used effectively to supplement writing.	2005	Orient Blackswan						ZZZ000000

Arun de Souza		This book shows how watershed development projects intervene in people's lives and the ways in which an entire community gets reconstructed around the implementation of a new resource. It challenges the popular view that rural communities are an unchanging entity, steeped in tradition and economically stagnant. The author deconstructs these preconceived notions through which rural India is perceived and establishes how a community, far from being static and autonomous, is fluid and changing.	2010	Orient BlackSwan						ZZZ000000

9788125037521	What Is Worth Teaching? (Rev Edn)	Krishna Kumar		Originally published as a collection of Krishna Kumar's UGC national lectures, What is Worth Teaching? has acquired the status of a popular analytical text on curriculum inquiry. The title essay poses the problem of curriculum design and content as aspects of the relationship between education and society. The central theme of knowledge, its selection and representation is pursued in the other essays in the book in the context of the issues such as the teaching of reading, the use of the textbook, gender socialisation, and the values associated with secularism. Structural and historical characteristics of the Indian system are used as frames to study the social character of school knowledge and skills. What is worth Teaching? covers a wide range of issues concerning institutional and pedagogic choices. From reading and storytelling in the early primary classes to the teaching of history in India and Pakistan, this collection of Krishna Kumar's lectures and essays offers an accessible introduction to critical inquiry in education theory.	2009	Orient BlackSwan						ZZZ000000

9788125037354	Word, image, text,studies in literary and visual culture	Shirshendu Chakrabarti Shormishtha Panja&Christel Devadawson		This collection of essays on the conceptualisation and representation of nature and time and their interrelationship in literature and the visual arts is written by scholars both from western academia and India, scholars who are established experts in their field as well as young critics making an early foray in the world of scholarly research. In addition, there is an essay by a practising artist meditating on nature and time through self-portraits. The contributors come from a wide variety of locations: India, Australia, Norway, Spain and the United States of America. The scope of the book is large: it encompasses not only the literature and art of Europe from the fifteenth through the nineteenth centuries, it also includes an examination of the art and literature of the Indian sub-continent. The verbal and visual genres examined are manifold: epyllion, comedy, epic, satire, children s fiction, travelogue, painting, sculpture, frontispiece, engraving, miniature, book illustration, cartoon, photograph. This book is a bold attempt to break down the isolation of the two disciplines, literature and the visual arts, and to make parallelism an exploratory method aimed at a mutually enriching synthesis. Since ideas and tendencies acquire an irreducibly concrete life in artistic representation, examination of the same life in two different art forms deepens our understanding of it as well as of the larger issues and contexts in which the literary and visual texts are embedded. While this is a collection of scholarly essays, there is enough here to interest the lay reader. A conscious effort has been made to eschew jargon and to make the style as clear and accessible as possible without in any way diluting the content. The addition of a number of valuable full-colour plates accessed from museums as diverse as the Royal Museum of Fine Arts of Belgium, Brussels; the Vatican Pinacotheca and the Victoria and Albert Museum will add to the reader s pleasure.	2009	Orient BlackSwan						ZZZ000000
