9788174465146	Materials Management	Rajendra Mishra		Materials management is an essential business function. It is concerned with managing materials, one of the four basic resources (labour, material, equipment, capital). Until recently, it was concerned with purchasing raw materials and very few parts from local markets. Raw materials were used to make most of the parts for making end products. Materials management was regarded as a routine function and was given less importance. But over the years, firms began to procure more and more parts and subassemblies from local as well as global markets. Today over 50% of the revenue of the firms goes for procuring materials, parts and subassemblies from outside. As a result, materials management function has evolved from a clerical buying function into a strategic business function that helps firms to survive and grow. It creates competitive edge by creating superior value by delivering quality product or service on time and offering lower cost by cutting its own cost as well as cutting purchased item cost.Very few of the available texts offer a comprehensive view of the subject & data and examples and cases in the context of Indian industries are limited.The contents of the subject are undergoing rapid changes. Earlier, purchasing was mostly confined to raw materials by manufacturing firms whereas now a large part of it consists of parts, subassemblies and assemblies, beside raw materials. A smaller number of suppliers are preferred now-a-days. Global sourcing is an accepted norm. A change in supplier relations from adversarial to partnership is evident. Lot sizes and lead-times are smaller and there is greater use of information technology.The book is designed to provide comprehensive coverage of the field of materials management by including emerging concepts, practices, tools, techniques, heuristics and quantitative models. Other features of the book include:v Important topics like outsourcing, purchase strategies and enterprise resource planning.v Cases from Indian industries on vendor managed inventory, outsourcing, and spare parts inventory.v Definition of key terms.v Questions at the end of each chapter and answers of selected questions.The book can serve as a text for undergraduate and postgraduate level courses on materials management in the institutes of management, engineering and technology, materials, industrial engineering, operations research and others. It can also serve as a reference for managers, engineers, consultants, and others interested in the field.	2009-01-01	Excel Books						ZZZ000000

9788189866754	Gas Insulated Substations,Gis	Naidu		The increase in demand for electricity and the growing energy density in metropolitan cities have made it necessary to extend the existing high voltage network right up to the consumer. Stepping down the voltage from transmission to the distribution level at the substations located near the actual consumers not only yields economic advantages, but also ensures reliable power supply. Such substations are required to meet a number of severe requirements, including small installation size, effective protection against atmospheric pollution and moisture, noiseless operation, nonexplosive and flame resistant, reduced maintenance, minimal radio interference while providing excellent electric characteristics. Conventional substations using atmospheric air as the main dielectric cannot satisfy these requirements, but totally enclosed substations using sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) gas insulation that are also known as Gas Insulated Substations (GIS). GIS is now in widespread use in the electrical power industry, especially in metropolitan areas. This book will serve as a valuable reference for the novice as well as the expert who needs a wider and detailed scope of coverage within the area of GIS.Gas Insulated Substations provides a comprehensive coverage of a wide range of topics which include:" Introduction to GIS & Properties of SF6" Layout, Design, Construction, Testing & Maintenance of GIS" Special Problems and Diagnostic Techniques" VFTO Phenomena and its Effects in GIS" Service Experience" Standards Specifications" Future Trends" Extensive ReferencesGas Insulated Substations (GIS) is the first single source for authoritative information on the state of the art in GIS.	2008	I.

9780787982386	Eisenhower on leadership,Ike's enduring lessons in total victory management	Alan Axelrod		"Dwight David Eisenhower never led a single soldier into battle. Before World War II, he had never even heard a shot fired in anger. His only 'combat wound' was the bad knee, weakened by a West Point football injury, that he twisted helping to push a jeep out of the Normandy mud. Yet it was Ike Eisenhower who, as supreme Allied commander in Europe, was responsible for leading the greatest military enterprise in history."  --From the Author's Introduction Eisenhower's task was not to lead men into battle, but to lead the generals who led men into battle. The skills that Ike possessed to manage the challenges of the strategic battleground-- coordinating, prioritizing, judging, and cajoling others toward a common goal--are the same skills CEOs need today to lead large and complex enterprises. Based on the findings in recently released archive papers and letters, as well as extensive library and historical resources, Alan Axelrod offers a compelling profile of the remarkable leadership discipline of a general often called a "military CEO." In fascinating detail, Axelrod reveals that Ike was more than a great military leader; he was also a great executive who could--and did--write a reassuring letter to the mother of a solider one moment?and make decisions impacting millions of lives the next. Follow Ike's path as Supreme Commander from the invasion of North Africa to victory in Europe and learn the lessons of great leadership along the way, including: The nature of leadership Managing detail without sacrificing the "big picture" Ensuring follow-through to execution Building a team Converting conflict into common cause Getting the facts and making plans Mentoring, motivating, and inspiring History buffs and business executives alike will find Eisenhower on Leadership a remarkable story of the man who embodies the qualities of selfless service--and who helped accomplish history's greatest mission.	2006	John Wiley and Sons						ZZZ000000

9781841126555	The rebel sell,how the counterculture became consumer culture	Joseph Heath&Andrew Potter		An explosive rejection of the myth of the counterculture in the most provocative book since No Logo. In this wide-ranging and perceptive work of cultural criticism, Joseph Heath and Andrew Potter shatter the central myth of radical political, economic and cultural thinking. The idea of a counterculture - that is, a world outside of the consumer dominated one that encompasses us - pervades everything from the anti-globalisation movement to feminism and environmentalism. And the idea that mocking the system, or trying to 'jam' it so it will collapse, they argue, is not only counterproductive but has helped to create the very consumer society that rad icals oppose. In a lively blend of pop culture, history and philosophical analysis, Heath and Potter offer a startlingly clear picture of what a concern for social justice might look like without the confusion of the counterculture obsession with being different.	2006	Capstone						ZZZ000000

This book fills the gap between what you learn in college and what you actually do in office. It explains the major concepts of marketing management in a friendly, easy-to-understand manner; and gives practical tips to make the transition from a 'college student' to a 'marketing professional' much easier. "This is a relevant guide for someone beginning a marketing career. The free-flowing style and lucid explanations make it an insightful read for the young professionals." Harsh Mariwala, CMD, Marico Ltd "Management students are traditionally introduced to the topics of Sales and Marketing in a disjointed & incoherent manner, usually taught by different faculty members. Ketan has marvelously attempted to create a unified framework for the different components of Marketing and Sales in a smooth yet down-to-earth story format. This book would be extremely useful for fresh recruits in Marketing or Sales. It will also be valuable for in-company Management Development Programmes for non-Marketing and Sales personnel."

9780230328129	Essence Of Leadership:Explorations From Literature	S Manikutty		This book seeks to explore leadership through study and interpretation of literature. It starts by stressing on the distinction between managerial roles, which are based on knowledge, techniques, skills and emphasis on results, and leadership roles that focuses on imagination, passion, commitment and fulfillment of dreams. Traditional management approaches, based on 'scientific' analysis, do not contribute much towards understanding leadership. This book shows how leadership can be better understood by reading and interpreting masterpieces of world literature and relating them to leadership issues.  The book argues that understanding leadership is really about understanding life, and this starts with gaining an understanding of the self. The book starts with Cervantes' masterpiece Don Quixote, whose main character asserts 'I know who I am' and believes in himself. This is followed by other works to highlight important issues: ambition and purpose in Chinua Achebe's Things Fall Apart, faith versus reason in Bertolt Brecht's The Life of Galileo, awakening the human spirit in Bernard Shaw's Saint Joan, authenticity in Girish Karnad's Tughlaq and the old Sanskrit play Mudrarakshasa by Visakhadatta, leaders and society in Arthur Miller's All My Sons, role of illusions in Ibsen's The Wild Duck, taking a stand in Ibsen's A Doll's House and the epic Mahabharata for development of perspective.  This book is based on the twenty-year experience of the authors, which they gained while teaching a course on leadership at the Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad. The authors felt that a stage has been reached when their experience needed to be shared with a wider range of academicians and corporate leaders.	2009	Macmillan Publishers India Ltd						ZZZ000000

Clark, professor of philosophy and Leverhulme Research Fellow, University of Liverpool, England At least in the United States, the so-called Culture Wars often boil down to the Darwin Wars.

9788189738600	Dancing With Kali	Lalita Das		Goa, land of sun, surf and sand, of secluded coves, and of forested hills, where foreigners frolic on the beaches without restraint and where, in the Hindu villages just a few kilometres inland, repressive traditions still rule. And when the boundary between the two is crossed, the consequences can be unpredictable. There in Goa, while roaming the beaches with a band of hippies, Alec, an up-and-coming English lawyer, meets Anu, the daughter of a prominent Hindu landowner, who is yearning for the freedom of choice. Their marriage sets in motion a chain of events that culminates eighteen years later when Ronnie comes to Goa to visit the beach where his mother was lost in the sea and meets Meera, a young girl whose mother is also dead living with her grandparents all three of whom are being ostracised by the community. And watching over them is Maushi Anu s mother and Meera s grandmother. An intricately woven saga of love, revenge, and retribution, the book resonates with the ethos of karma; the eternally intertwined dance of destruction and creation the dance of Kali, who wipes out the karma and fulfils the desires of her devotees. Weaving in Hindu and Christian philosophies, Goan and hippie cultures, the modalities of Western urban gentry and the Indian rural structure, the lucid narrative skilfully juxtaposes human emotions tribulations with failures; empathy with apathy; vengeance with resurrection celebrating the poise and strength of womanhood.

For too long, however, the Pahari painter, the maker of these images, has continued to be seen as belonging to an indeterminate, anonymous group of craftsmen who simply plied predetermined brushes. The present work is aimed at challenging that notion, for it presents the painter as thinking man, faced with, and capable of, exercising choices. It was time that the 'long winter of neglect' in which he had been left by history came to an end.	2009-10-01	Niyogi Books						ZZZ000000

9788189738488	The Bakkarwals of Jammu and Kashmir Navigating Through Nomadism	Anita Sharma		Sedentary patterns of living are often termed as 'civilized', yet, in semi-arid regions, pastoral nomadism remains an efficient subsistence-base. While seven per cent of India is nomadic, a majority have little access to development programmes. Research across continents reveals that the success of such initiatives among nomads is contingent upon their sensitivity to a mobile lifestyle. The pastoral Bakkarwals of Jammu and Kashmir herd goat and sheep and are a subset of the buffalo-herding Gujjars of the State. They migrate and return annually from the hills of the Jammu-Poonch region through the insurgency-riddled Pir Panjal into the Valley, to beyond the tree line atop the highland pastures of the Greater Himalayas. The Bakkarwals of Jammu and Kashmir: Navigating through Nomadism presents this almost entirely nomadic community, through an ethnography of their social association, religion, language, folklore and material culture, normative beliefs and indigenous knowledge, the contexts for development, gender relations, the nature of power and reciprocity, as well as the indices of change, with the aim to sensitize the reader to the precariousness of their lives, as also to their remarkable vitality and grace.	2009-10-01	Niyogi Books						ZZZ000000

9788170945611	It S When You Sell That Counts	D L Cassidy		Success in the stock market is only partially governed by which shares you buy, and when you buy them. The fact is that you actually realise your profits only when you sell. Fear, greed, and just plain confusion lead millions of investors to postpone selling their shares almost indefinitely, or at least till long after the right time is over. While most investment books tend to deal primarily with the buying of shares, It's When You Sell That Counts focuses exclusively on the neglected but equally critical second side of the coin-selling: How to deal with your emotional barriers to selling; How to set your selling price targets; How to time your sales in a bull market; Selling versus holding in a bear market; Special rules for selling low-priced shares. Failure to sell at the right time is all-too-common a pitfall.

9788170945604	Knowledge Management	Carl Davidson&Voss Davidson		There is a common saying in Knowledge Management that 'none of us is as smart as all of us'. Leo Platt, the CEO of Hewlett-Packard, once famously remarked that 'if only HP knew what HP knows, we'd be three times as profitable.' Responding to this challenge is what knowledge management is all about. It offers ways that organisations can identify, activate, and apply the knowledge available to them. It is about those processes by which useful knowledge is made available to others in an organisation, to enable everyone to carry out business processes faster, better, and at lower costs. The good news is that organisations with strong knowledge management practices are more likely to be profitable, have a greater market share, perform better than before they introduced knowledge management, be more flexible in dealing with change (and especially in dealing with crises), have better workplace morale, and develop innovative products than organisations without such practices. Drawing on the authors' extensive experience, this book identifies the secret to successful knowledge management and how to get started.	2005-03-01	Orient Paperbacks						ZZZ000000
9788122200539	Voices in the city	Anita Desai		Voices in the City is based on the life of the middle class intellectuals of Calcutta. It is an unforgettable story of a Bohemian brother and his two sisters caught in the crosscurrents of changing social values. In many ways the story reflects a vivid picture of India's social transition - a phase in which the older elements are not altogether dead, and the emergent ones not fully evolved. The novel describes the bitter effects of the urban living upon an Indian family. Brought up in luxury and magnificence by an over indulgent mother, Nirode settles down in Calcutta and becomes engrossed in its bohemian life, while his elder sister, Monisha lives out a servile existence within the rigid and stiff confines of a traditional Hindu family. Amla sees the city as a monster, Nirode sacrifices everything for his career, and Monisha cannot bear her stifling existence in the household of a wealthy old Calcutta family.	2005	Orient Paperbacks						ZZZ000000
9788170943952	Teaching of the Bhagavad Gita	Swami Dayananda		A classical interpretation for the modern mind. For centuries the Bhagavad Gita has remained the single most influential philosophical text shaping Indian thought and life. It addresses itself foursquare to the universal limitations each human being is confronted with: ignorance, sorrow and death. The teaching of the Bhagavad Gita opens with the audacious statement that all these are illegitimate problems caused by ignorance about the real nature of the self. Drawing upon the essence of all Upanishads, Gita explains how the self, the atman, is limitless, indestructible, unborn. This knowledge, Brahmavidya, frees one from all sense of limitation. This is the principal teaching of the Bhagavad Gita. Swami Dayananda's is a classical vedantic interpretation of the Bhagavad Gita. Without getting lost in a rigid verse-by-verse translation, he plunges with great verve and energy into the central theme of the gita, unerringly picking and choosing key verses to highlight its message. A highly respected and very popular teacher of vedanta, Swami Dayananda succeeds marvelously in conveying the profundity of the Bhagavad Gita, unfolding its teaching with a style and clarity which will appeal to every modern mind.	2005-03-01	Vision Books						ZZZ000000

The treatments described in this book are based on the authors' observations and clinical experiences for many years. The preparations described here are from the ancient Ayurvedic texts. Ayurveda is a science based on ancient Indian philosophy. It can appropriately be called 'The Science of Living'. Ayurveda traces its etymology to Ayush, meaning 'life', and Veda, which originates from vid or knowledge. Popularly speaking, Ayurveda can be defined as a medical science which helps the human body to keep fit, while providing cures from indigenous plants, animal products and minerals for ailments. Thus, being essentially a science of healing, it concentrates on what is required to lead a healthy, normal life. It deals not only with what is to be done when one falls ill, but also with what should be done to maintain one's health and vigour. Ayurveda contains details about body care and the various foods and drinks which promote health. Ayurveda is based on scientific principles of diagnosis and treatment. It differs from conventional medicine in the basic principles of investigation and assigning causes to processes rather than specific areas of physiology. This book comprises time-tested concepts of regulated diet and a healthy lifestyle, supported with remedies and treatments based on Ayurveda that are safe, effective and affordable.	1995-06-01	Orient Paperbacks						ZZZ000000

9788170944942	The Ramayana	R. K. Narayan		For centuries, Indians have held Rama to be the perfect man: unfailingly noble, utterly poised, fearless and strong, wise, compassionate and free from anger, a just ruler and an implacable foe of all wrongdoers. Countless others worship Rama as an avatar, a human incarnation of Lord Vishnu born to vanquish the forces of evil and establish a kingdom of perfect justice and harmony upon the earth. The Ramayana, one of lndia's greatest epics, lovingly unfolds the story of Rama's life. Ever since its original composition in Sanskrit by Vaimiki, possibly over 3,000 years ago, it has grown to be an all-pervasive and hugely-loved part of Indian life and ethos. Millions read it, re-read it, and revere it as a scripture. It is the perennially favourite bedtime story for children. And each autumn, Rama's victory over the mighty demon-king Ravana is celebrated through plays and dance-dramas in cities, towns and villages across the land. There is much festivity: crackers are exploded, sweets distributed and all houses are lit up in tribute to Rama. R.K. Narayan's Ramayana is inspired by a Tamil-version of the epic written by an eleventh century poet, Kamban. It offers the reader a compact yet unhurried retelling of this great epic, and succeeds marvellously in evoking its literary lustre which has shone undimmed through the centuries.	1987	Vision						ZZZ000000

9788182743915	7 DEADLY SINS CORPORATE MISMANAGEMENT	Dr. Udai Vir Singh		The volcano of "Satyam's Great Fraud", an over Rs.7,000 crore swindle by its Chairman and CEO, Mr. Ramalinga Raju, the largest in India's known economic history, burst into the open during the chilly days of early January 2009, when the painfuyl dust of the Mumbai8 carnage of 26/11 was just starting to settle. Its debris inflicted painful wounds on the psyche of its over 50,000 employees, thousands of international customers, and millions of investors in India and abroad. Several of its bankers, financers, suppliers, auditors, and senior managers too did not escape monor economic and psychological wounds. The basic issue thrown up by this disgraceful fall of one of India's internationally iconic IT-brands, besides frauds and financial malfunctioning, is that of corporate mis-governance. Satyam is not the only culprit in the corporate forest of India. There are several Satyams in India's realty and infrastructure sectors where those in the know say that top politicians have dirtied their hands and faces fairly substantially. They are awaiting exposure which will require whistleblowers of exemplary courage and resourcefulness. On lower scales, as per the author's personal experience, minor Satyams happen every days in almost every Indian corporate identity, It will, indeed, be impossible to locate an exception. To sum up, Satyam basically highlights the issue of corporate mismanagement. This book elaborates the author's personal encounters with a number of situations of corporate mismanagement over a period of over 40 years during which he passed through unrighteous business environments. Each and every reader of this book, if he or she has some exposure to corporate work environment, is guaranteed emergence of a cascade of similar situations on their mental screen, while going through it.	2009-02-01	Pentagon Press						ZZZ000000

9788120734036	Baba's Rinanubandh,Leelas During His Sojourn in Shirdi	Vinny Chitluri		The word 'Rinanubandh' literally means 'Karmic Debt'. It is an impossible task to write the exact meaning of this word; as a lot of the nuances are lost while doing so. When you read about the lives of Baba's devotees you realise that it has a deeper meaning. A bond that has existed for many generations. His devotees came from varied backgrounds. Some highly educated, others were rustic villagers. Some were young, while others were middle-aged and set in their ways. They went to Shirdi not knowing what to expect. Others went there by chance. But once they met Baba their lives were changed forever. And the 'Karmic bond' started unfolding. Thus they returned time and again to be with the living God who blessed them and gave them a handful of udi. In the years that followed, no matter what befell them they knew that Baba was always with them. This book is a kaleidoscope of leelas, photographs and the lives of Baba's devotees.	2008-08-07	Sterling Publishers Pvt. Ltd						ZZZ000000
9788120738591	Baba's Vaani,His Sayings and Teachings	Vinny Chitluri		This book is a collection of the sayings and teachings of Baba, that are highlighted in the experiences of the devotees as they interacted with Him. Through direct intervention in their lives, and the use of parables, He led them to spiritual growth. Like the caring parent that He is, He used love and humour to help His devotees understand profound philosophical and spiritual ideas. These ideas were expressed in simple language, and often seen in practice in their ordinary day-to-day experiences, so that devotees were unaware that they were acquiring bodha paddhati. Bodha is instruction, or perception, and paddhati is protocol or steps of a ritual.	2008-08-07	Sterling Publishers Pvt. Ltd						ZZZ000000

Through the ages, we have heard the voice of sanity, the voice of love and concern above the din of this madness. We had heard it when Kahlil Gibran said in The Prophet: "Your daily life is your temple and your religion. Whenever you enter into it, take with you ... all men." And we hear it again in this book. This book is an attempt to glean the best in living religious literature, and also is a guide to the understanding of the fundamental unity underlying the great religions of the world.	2008-08-07	Sterling Publishers Pvt.

The art of editing falls into two categories: journalistic skills to do the job; and editing skills that make the unintelligible readable. In the past, most of us learnt it through a painful process of trial and error. We don't want the new comers to suffer from that pain and therefore this book Communication Skills: Effective Editing.	2010	Sterling Publishers Pvt., Limited						ZZZ000000

A woman bowed respectfully. Her arm reached out to touch his feet. Suddenly there was an explosion. The deafening sound, the clouds of smoke, the shattered bodies, the blood and gore. Who put together the pieces? Who saw through the foul play? Follow the trail. Follow the trial. Follow the story to know the truth. This book unfolds the gripping story -- at once fascinating and grim -- of perhaps the first case of assassination of a world-class leader by a human bomb.

D R Kaarthikeyan was called upon by the Government of India to unravel the mystery.

How much are we to compromise with the ethos of a game to commercialize it? We are yet to do away with the already existing evils of betting, match-fixing, corrupt officials, rigged selection process, etc. and we are adding more vice to it than virtue. Cricket is on a sticky wicket today. Apart from the rare spark of sportsman spirit which you might still see here and there, cricket is in news for all the wrong reasons. Money rules the game; Muscle dictates what and who will find place in the game; and Marketing is running the show for cricket.	2008	UBS Publishers' Distributors						ZZZ000000
9788185944760	arms and the man	Bernard Shaw		Emma Woodhouse is rich, intelligent, artistic, happy...and bored. Her governess married, her father is widowed and occupied with his own irregular health issues and his own feelings and his own consolations. Emma, though charming and clever, is restless and impatient. Because of her monetary and social resources she attempts to restructure the life of her poor friend Harriet Smith by presenting her as a cultured woman who would be suitable marriage material to those of Emma's own social environment. Harriet, however, is acquaintanced by farmers and does not know her real parents, so her acceptability by Emma's group is questionable. Emma is intrusive and patronizing enough to offer Harriet to Emma's lofty community where Harriet is shy and afraid to insist on her own preferences. Instead she permits Emma these introductions. Nr. Knightly, a longtime neighbor of Emma and her father, sees a fault in the relationship between Emma and Harriet: Harriet overpraises Emma's choices and gives in to her worst temperaments. Emma's imperious hold on events and behaviors threatens to choke everyone involved until she is shown her mistakes and is saved from social catastrophe by Mr. Knightly. Emma begins to understand that she is spoiled and self-centered enough to only listen to her own opinion. Then she starts to forsake her condescending spirit and to become a better companion to her friends. She is also willing to admit her weakness at organizing the lives of others and to rearrange her priorities so that satisfaction with her own life becomes more important than governing the affairs of everyone else.

But no one moved from his place. All along the track we chanted: 'Praise be to the Almighty, the Formless One, Praise be...' The chant went on in unison. And then the train went backwards... When we were returning to our village that evening, my mother began to tell my sister the story of the Temple of the Guru's Palm. She told her how the Guru came that way with his disciple: how the disciple thirsted and Guru sent him to the dervish at the top of the hill; how the dervish turned him back three times: how the Guru asked his disciple to pick up a rock; how the spring burst forth from under it and the well of the dervish dried up; how the dervish had hurled the boulder; and how the Guru had said: Praise be to the Almighty, the Formless One, and stopped it with the palm of his hand.	2009	UBS Publishers' Distributors Pvt.

9788174766434	The Mystique Of Sikhism	Duggal&K S		Mystique is much too abstract a term. To realize it, it is best to see it reflected in an appropriate event. Here is one: During the freedom struggle, a train loaded with freedom fighters was passing through Panja Sahib (Hasan Abdal), it was not to stop at Panja Sahib railway station. The Sikhs of the town came to know that the arrested patriots were without food and water. How could such a train be allowed to pass Panja Sahib where Guru Nanak had quenched the thirst of Bhai Mardana by performing a miracle? But the White Man insisted that the train must run through without stopping at any intervening station. The Sikhs must have the train stop and feed the patriots who were hungry and without water. They pleaded with the authorities without success. They must stop the train. They lay down on the railway line; men, women and children, hundreds of them. The train came whistling and screaming. It crushed one, two, three and came to a halt. The moment the train stopped the freedom fighters were fed and provided water. This is just one incident reflecting the Sikh mystique. As the reader wades through the pages of the volume, he or she would come across a variety of them reflecting mystique of Sikh faith.	2009	UBS Publishers' Distributors Pvt. Ltd.						ZZZ000000

9788185944579	Tess of the D'Urbervilles	Thomas Hardy		"Susanna Rabow-Edling examines the first theory of the Russian nation, formulated by the Slavophiles in the second quarter of the nineteenth century, and its relationship to the West. Using cultural nationalism as a tool for understanding Slavophile thinking, she argues that a Russian national identity was not shaped in opposition to Europe in order to separate Russia from the West. Rather, it originated as an attempt to counter the feeling of cultural backwardness among Russian intellectuals by making it possible for Russian culture to assume a leading role in the universal progress of humanity. This reinterpretation of Slavophile ideas about the Russian nation offers a more complex image of the role of Europe and the West in shaping a Russian national identity."--BOOK JACKET.	2006	UBS Publishers' Distributors Pvt.

And how much developed and structured will the social ethos of such a culture be? As most of the modern psychologists and scientists are discovering, it will definitely be better than the present society we are living in. Should we then not consider the call of, `Back to Vedas` more seriously? Vedas hold the solution to the problems plaguing the world today, not only about science but about a good living, about balance, mental health and stress-free life, about total contentment. If only we peruse through the vast world of knowledge contained in the Vedas, we will surely bless our lives with much abundance, satisfaction and peace. Every shloka in the Vedas is a pearl of wisdom, which we always had and yet cared not to preserve its preciousness. This book is an attempt to bring about in the human thinking today all that is good and promised by the Vedas, the eternal source of wisdom.

9780230639959	Issues In Twentieth-Century World History	Sneh Mahajan		The twentieth century was the most extraordinary era in human history. It can be described as the most populated, most inventive, most communicative and most murderous century. It saw colossal events like the two World Wars, the rise of Fascism, the Great Depression, the strengthening and disintegration of worldwide empires, and the Cold War and its demise. It also witnessed great improvement in the quality of life as also in the capacity of humans to make such growth unsustainable. By the end of the century, globalisation became the defining feature. There were social movements centring on issues like preventing ecological degradation, human rights, empowerment of women etc. Basically, these movements questioned traditional power structures. These developments decisively influenced both the ways of thought and modes of behaviour and, hence, cultural trends. The results of these processes are still unfolding. Issues in Twentieth-Century World History covers this vibrant period of worl	2009	Macmillan Publishers India Ltd						ZZZ000000

9780230639799	Introduction To Disaster Management	Satish Modh		Disaster Management as a subject essentially deals with management of resources andinformation as far as a disastrous event is concerned and also how effectively and seamlessly one coordinates these resources. Disaster management, at the individual and organisational level, deals with issues of planning, coordinating, communication and risk management. A book to teach disaster management would accomplish very little unless a broad spectrum of knowledge is imparted regarding effects of various types of disasters, their dimensions and characteristics, the role of United Nations in complex emergencies and the role of Indian government in prevention and control of disasters. Equally important is the knowledge about various international and national agencies involved in disaster relief and humanitarian assistance. This book covers all these subjects in order to enhance the ability of students and professionals for better disaster response.	2009	Macmillan Publishers India Ltd						ZZZ000000

9780230328853	An Advanced History of Modern India	Sailendra Nath Sen		About the Book : - An Advanced History of Modern India has been designed for undergraduate students as well as those preparing for civil services examinations at both central and state levels. It is a daunting task to write a book of this kind when dynamic changes have occurred in the last three decades in the historiography of modern India, including Subaltern Studies by reputed scholars both in India and abroad. An attempt has been made to weave the known facts of history with the unknown, fostering a spirit of enquiry among modern generations. Apart from political history, due emphasis has been laid on socio-economic changes, administrative innovations, cultural ferments and trials and tribulations of the nationalist movements. The author has not ignored the post-independence era that led to the emergence of a new India vibrant with a new lease of life. The book is adequately with maps. A detailed chronology, biographical notes of distinguished personalities, list of Congress sessions including names of Presidents, Prime Ministers, Presidents and Vice-Presidents of independent India and an exhaustive list of bibliography is also included. The author with his wide experience of teaching and research for about six decades has enlivened the dry bones of modern Indian history in an easy flowing style without any historical bias. About the Author : - Professor Sailendra Nath Sen, engaged in research and teaching for about six decades, has been awarded D.Phil (1958) and D.Litt (1970) degrees from the University of Calcutta for his research work on the history of the Marathas.

9788189738563	Half a Face	Nonda Chatterjee		The imprints of her ancestors feet that were displayed, amongst other memorabilia, on the walls of her house had always intrigued Priti, for to her they were malevolent. As she grew up, she almost obsessively questioned the mystery that lay behind the absence of the footprint of her great grandmother, the enigmatic Gauri, whose name was a taboo in the family and any questions asked pertaining to her life, considered blasphemous. Her grandfather was aware of this and on his deathbed, he bequeathed a key to her to unravel the truth lost in the dark shades of feudal Bengal. Will Priti be successful in the arduous task she has before her and what will her findings be? Brilliantly structured, the book has been aesthetically crafted, with its narrative moving on a parallel course between the past and the present, between rural Bengal and modern Kolkata, between hard-core realism and lyrical emotion. Steeped in local colour, the two voices quite distinct yet gradually merging in Priti's consciousness, create a mystery that proceeds at breakneck speed, compels the reader's total attention but never loses sight of the feminist issues at stake.	2010	Niyogi Books						ZZZ000000

9788189738532	Akriti to Sanskriti : The Journey of Indian Forms	Harsha V. Dehejia		India is a civilization of many images, a culture of many visual feasts, a tradition where the visible and the palpable are as important as the oral and the occurrent, where our highest truths are embodied not only in our erudite texts but in our kathas (stories) and gathas (songs), akritis (visual forms) and rachanas (compositions), rich with a variety of forms, shapes, designs and motifs. Akriti to Sankriti: The Journey of Indian Forms explores some akritis that adorn both majestic and grand monuments, as well as common and ordinary spaces, and which through their purely visual language are pointers to not only our culture, but equally to brahma jnana or transcendental knowledge. These beautiful visual representations of both the ordinary people and artisans, are not individual expressions but that of the shared experiences of the community and the preserve of the family, passed down through endless generations. They are neither mere designs nor decorations, nor meant only for rites and rituals, but in their own unpretentious way become sources of visual knowledge and have a culture of their own. Akriti to Sanskriti, a unique analysis and repository of Indian visual forms, is a collectorâÂ€Â™s tome.	2010	Niyogi Books						ZZZ000000
